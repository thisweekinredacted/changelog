A quick write up to answer some questions I\u2019ve been getting. \n40F native. The land we are on has been passed down many many generations. It\u2019s huge. There\u2019s cabins and caches that have been built and are still there by my great great great ancestors. And to show how much our family goes down we even have some artifacts in the museum in our province ! \n1- sorry for the grammar English is not my native tongue. \n2- I\u2019ll be sharing in this post information from my elders about Sasquatch It\u2019s important to know that not all tribes have the same relationship and some are not allowed to share knowledge like this. \n\nAs far as I can remember and this is also teachings my children are learning. We have been told not to fear him but to respect him. \nThat just like us he wants to be left alone and he is just protecting his family and territory.\nSigns to look for :\nThey will bend big ass branches or trees. We are still after all these generations trying to figure out what they mean but we generally avoid the areas we see this.  We even mark the trees when we see something unusual so that whoever is out hunting will be cautious also. \nThey make little dams in the waterways for water to be easily accessible to them. They pile rocks and leaves together. \nIn the winter they will break the ice to access the water so if everything is frozen over and you come to a creek bed that\u2019s been smashed you\u2019re messing with his food. Leave everything as you found it. \nThey will also tie hair to branches and a big guess is to either mark their territory or leave their scent. \nTree or rock knocks are definitely a sign you are getting to close this is him warning you stay away \nThey LOVE berries when it\u2019s gathering time we always make sure to leave him some it forms a kind of mutual respect. \nAlways remember that like any living thing they are as scared of us as we are of them so they will definitely act on a animal instinct this is why it\u2019s just better to avoid getting in a bad situation. \nThey are very very good at blending in with nature you need a very well trained eye . We beleive that they are spiritual beings that have been here way before us so who are we to go trampling on their land or hunt them \u2026 \nThat\u2019s at the top of my head  happy to answer questions and I will post later about all the \u201cweird\u201d stuff we\u2019ve found in the mountains that shouldn\u2019t be there. \nMigwetch\u2019 ", "media": null, "score": 530, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "comment_count": 102, "over_18": false}, "8": {"id": "1g4nbfy", "locked": false, "subreddit": "cryptozoology", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "JKswin", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1729306832.6051776, "created_utc": 1729040170.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/ntrkcov4o0vd1.jpeg", "title": "Someone around my area captured clear photos and video of the mythical panther/huge cat in Australia ", "permalink": "/r/Cryptozoology/comments/1g4nbfy/someone_around_my_area_captured_clear_photos_and/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 2382, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comment_count": 298, "over_18": false}, "9": {"id": "1g5zb8q", "locked": false, "subreddit": "humanoidencounters", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "Southern_Dig_9460", "link_flair_text": "Unidentified", "time": 1729306832.871604, "created_utc": 1729193637.0, "url": "https://youtu.be/cphe8d5xnPA?si=zJMSCjT_m5qPOOoG", "title": "51 years ago today a Police Chief took a picture of a Metallic Humanoid in Falkville, Al", "permalink": "/r/Humanoidencounters/comments/1g5zb8q/51_years_ago_today_a_police_chief_took_a_picture/", "selftext": "Police Chief Jeffrey Greenhaw responded to a 911 call of a UFO landing in town.

So every year for the past few years my parents have been going on a week-long anniversary trip leaving me home alone (I was 20 so it was more than an appropriate age). Well this time around some weird shit happened the first day that they were gone and then this happened the night before they were supposed to come home. \nThe first day they were gone a guy came to the door to drop something off in the morning, but I didn\u2019t want to answer it as it was a stranger and I thought he\u2019d just leave it at the door like usual. Well he stayed for about 5 minutes and then got in his car and started to drive off, to which I went outside because I thought he finally left it. THIS MAN GOT OUT OF HIS CAR, leaving it in the middle of the road, just to give me my package that I didn\u2019t have to sign for at all. No signature needed or anything, wasn\u2019t dressed like a delivery person, was in a beat up car, very weird and uncomfy. \nSkipping to the end of the week, I was just chilling out in my living room and all of a sudden at 11:00 at night, I see this rather large figure approach my front door (the glass is dimpled so you can\u2019t see features but just a silhouette) and starts BANGING on my door and he did so for like a minute straight. He stands there and doesn\u2019t leave for probably 10 minutes and in that time beats on the door a few times over. Luckily, my sister and her family live not even a mile away from me so I call them and her husband comes to get me. By this time I\u2019m in full panic mode and I realize that my dogs are in the backyard. My back door is 90% glass and I was horrified that this person was going to come through the back gate and try to come into my house as my dogs were barking up a storm. \nAnyways, I get my dogs inside the house and my brother-in-law finally shows up and whoever was there was gone. He takes me to my sister\u2019s house and we check the front door cameras to see who was there. The cameras had been turned off the whole time this person was there and for an hour before he started banging on my door. The cameras had been on before that time period and during the time we were looking at the cameras. They were somehow shut off for about an hour and a half which was odd because they\u2019re not the type that needs to be charged and they had never glitched before then, but were actually very sensitive. \nTo this day I don\u2019t know who it was that showed up attention house, I checked the local news and everything, but nothing ever came of it. I don\u2019t know if they were trying to rob my house or if they had other plans or if it was potentially the delivery guy from earlier that week, but it still freaks me out to think about and I hate being home alone at night because of it.

I\u2019ve never been great at writing descriptively and I\u2019m honestly still at a loss for words. But that being said, last night, my friends and I went to the movies in hopes of watching the Joker 2. We hadn\u2019t bought the tickets online, and unfortunately, we got there just after the doors closed. But because we were already there, we decided to see what else was playing within the hour and decided on the Terrifier 3. None of us had heard of the Terrifier before, but it sounded interesting enough. However, soon after the movie started, I immediately felt my stomach drop. \nAbout 5 months ago, I went on a run at a park I had never been to before. My aunt told me about how it had a great trail, and because it was finally getting warm out, I decided to go even though it was out of the way from where I live. To set the scene of this park, there was a big clearing where there were picnic benches, gazebos, and a playground; however, it was surrounded by a big forest which was where the trail was. About 15 minutes into my run, my headphone\u2019s battery died, so I paused to put them away in my pouch. As I was opening my bag, I saw something out of the corner of my eye and looked into the trees to see a clown standing next to his car with a whole thing of balloons. The scene immediately scared the absolute shit out of me, as I\u2019ve always been a huge true crime junkie, and I turned around and ran back to the clearing and eventually the parking lot. I cannot even begin to describe how psyched out I was, it literally felt like my heart was going to tear through my chest. But when I was sitting in my car, I noticed that there was a big group of young kids in the gazebo who were clearly having a birthday party and I never felt dumber/more relieved. It was obvious that the clown was meant for the party what with his balloons. I laughed at myself even though I still felt on edge, and drove back home.\nI had forgotten about the incident up until last night, but when I saw the clown in the movie\u2019s costume, I immediately felt sick. The man I saw in the forest was wearing the same exact costume. I don\u2019t know for sure whether this character\u2019s costume is unique to the movie or not, but after trying to look up similar clown costumes, I\u2019m fairly certain it is. Everything was the same, even down to the stupid hat headband. I\u2019m freaked the fuck out and don\u2019t know what any of it means. If I really did come across some guy dressed as a fictional clown killer, why were they wearing it and why in the empty part of an old park? A big part of me hopes that it was some sort of twisted prank, but if so why wouldn\u2019t he go somewhere where he knew people would see him? And after watching the movie, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there were sick fucks out there who idolised him in a morbid way.", "media": null, "score": 98, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "comment_count": 15, "over_18": true}, "29": {"id": "1g3fxyd", "locked": false, "subreddit": "truecreepy", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "littlequeef99", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1729306847.2524874, "created_utc": 1728913026.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/i9vn6qp26qud1.jpeg", "title": "Erdstall Tunnels - around 2,000 Medieval era tunnels can be found throughout Europe.

I literally grew up with one of the guys arrested. It's not what folks are saying.\nIt's not shiz or blood and it's obsurd to me that these guys are assigning all hell to these merely goofy ass Jewish teens\ud83e\udd23\nThe real situation is Religious drama and typical stupid teenage behavior combined. Basically this is a Chabad (Lubavitch) synagogue at 770 Eastern Parkway Brooklyn New York.\nIt's a sacred place for us (I'm not longer religious but it's my family and friends) because it is our last Rabbi's - Menachem Mendel Schneirson the Lubavitcher Rebbes home base. He passed away like 30 years ago ever since there has been a divide in leadership of 770 specifically. Just like nobody can agree on anything in politics, it's the same here. The shul (synagogue) is a dump. Not because the money doesn't exist, but because none of the head Rabbi's can agree on anything and get their act together. \nThe Lubavitcher Rebbe was fully set on expanding 770 and it's been 30 years since his passing. The teenagers decided they are fed up with the politics and the lack of action and decided to expand 770 themselves, HENCE THE TUNNELS.\nThe mattress seen in this viral picture was used to transport the rubble that they were breaking off from the walls to who fricking knows where (probably just moved it to the side to make room for more digging) Yes a mattress. I assume they brought it from the bochurims dorm room called 749 (young adult dorm) where there are plenty of mattresses.\nWant to talk about how stupid reckless and silly this is? Go ahead I'll join you. But blood and shiz? If you are seriously telling people this you are perpetuating lies. Personally, I think it's hilarious because I grew up around many of the bochurim in 770, they are extremely lively, goofy/funny and hippie like in many ways. I used to be one of them myself! \nAsk me any questions you want I am happy to answer with everything I know.\nRandom details: I think the tunnel was being dug to connect with another building but not entirely sure where they were digging to. I also know they didn't start from scratch, for years that general area was boarded up I think it was some unfinished room or something. Do they just took off the boards and started expanding that random room. Yes it is against the law. How serious were they about digging the tunnel? Not sure but how fricking serious can they be?? Only the real goofheads were doing this everyone was studying with their partners as usual and they were using a mattress to move the rubble so how serious could they be?\nAnyway chat with me in the comments peace", "media": null, "score": 2874, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "comment_count": 909, "over_18": false}, "38": {"id": "1g1xr7b", "locked": false, "subreddit": "conspiracyfact", "stickied": false, "category": "Consipiracy", "author": "AnthonyofBoston", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1729306856.1277015, "created_utc": 1728731231.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/user/AnthonyofBoston/comments/1fycfmw/now_is_the_time_create_armaaruss_and_prevent/", "title": "This video explains that there is no better time than now to make an image of the beast Mars", "permalink": "/r/conspiracyfact/comments/1g1xr7b/this_video_explains_that_there_is_no_better_time/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.4, "comment_count": 0, "over_18": false}, "39": {"id": "1g542rv", "locked": false, "subreddit": "bigfoot", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "Silly-Membership-945", "link_flair_text": "question", "time": 1729306856.863773, "created_utc": 1729097434.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/zu6uuc3fe5vd1.jpeg", "title": "Big foot loves horses ", "permalink": "/r/bigfoot/comments/1g542rv/big_foot_loves_horses/", "selftext": "I came across a post on Facebook claiming that Bigfoot has a fondness for horses and enjoys braiding their manes.

There is a lot on record to pull more reports from. Here is another set of intresting tales from the box of chilling Nordic \"cold\" cases. This time most of the stories are focused on strange humanoids encountered without a UFO nearby. Are they even aliens then? Maybe they are from somewhere else? You decide! As usual 4 reports from Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland. Also, I must warn sensitive readers about the last case...it is a bit violent...\nThe Little Man of the North.\nNorthen Sweden and Finland, February 1971.\nDuring February 1971 a strange little being was seen along the roads at night in Sweden and Finland. A lot of calls came in to UFO-investigators and news reporters. And many newspapers in northen Sweden started to write about it. \u201dThe Little Man\u201d now became a concept among ordinary people. And a lot of people were actually a little scared of this creature back then. The \u201dLittle Man\u201d legend started with a report of a mysterious sighting in northen Finland, which was published in the swedish newspaper \u201dNorrl\u00e4ndska Socialdemokraten\u201d on February 15, 1971. Some of you might find this report familiar:\nOn February 2, 1971, at approximately 8 pm, two Finnish women - Sinikka Kuittinen and one Mrs. Manninen - were driving from Kuusamo towards Oulu in a region near Kiiminki, when they saw a strange light behind their car, on the right side of the road. After a few moments, this mysterious light slipped over the vehicle and began to pace the car on the left side of the road. Sinikka, who was driving the vehicle, claimed that as the UFO passed overhead her ears began to mysteriously \u201cplug up.\u201d When the pair arrived at a nearby field, the light abruptly disappeared. This is when Kuittinen and Manninen both claimed to have caught a glimpse of the unbelievable. The women later insisted that they had seen a peculiar, helmeted creature that stood approximately 1 m (3-feet) tall. They both agreed that this strange being was clad in a greenish-brown suit and crossed the road in front of them utilizing a series of small jumps. - Ring a bell? - Yes, it is actually one of the reports for the Kinulla Ufonaut case. Is the Kinulla humanoid connected to the \u201dLittle Man\u201d sightings. Maybe? We don\u2019t really know, beacuse they don\u2019t look very much alike. \u2013 \u201dBut some say the Kinulla humanoid was an April 1st hoax\u201d\u2026 Or was it?\nAre the Kinnula Ufonaut and the Little man connected? Both were reported around the same period in February 1971. (source: Cryptid Wiki)\nThe first report about the Little Man was actually already made on the 15th of August the year before, along road 397 in Norrbotten, Sweden. This night it was raining and Assar Sandberg together with Olof and M\u00e4rta Mohlinder were on their way in a car between Narken and Jokkfall, when at about 9 pm they saw a small strange man standing by the side of the road at a junction of a smaller road. M\u00e4rta's husband exclaims: \"What a strange person!\". At the same moment there is a bang and a bright white light in front of them fills the car. Even the radio crackles. At the same time, they see how the little man raises his arm to protect his face. They are now only about 3 - 4 meters (9 - 12 feet) from the little man. All three were very scared and Assar who was driving the car was blinded and had to brake hard to avoid going off the road. A few days later, Assar had to see a doctor due to problems with his eyes. M\u00e4rta Mohlinder describes the creature as 1 meter (3 feet) short and stooped, and wearing a black raincoat. He also had some kind of dark cap or helmet on his head and she couldn't see his face. Mrs. Mohlinder drew a sketch of the man (see picture). And the area of \u200b\u200bthe incident is desolate. There is only forest there and the nearest settlement is far away. The three observers then regretted not getting out of the car and looking for the person, but they were too scared and shaken up and sped away.\nMrs Mohlinder\u00b4s sketch of the strange Little Man at the side of the road. (source: UFO-Information)\nOn February 15, 1971, the same day the article was published in a newspaper, two women in K\u00e4lsj\u00e4rv near Kalix were up late at night playing records. By chance one of the women looked out the window. She then saw a strange creature on the road, which was a short distance from the house. She described it as 1 meter (3 feet) long and \"crooked\". It was dark outside, but they saw that it wore black clothes and on its head it wore a kind of black cap. She could see no face. After a while, the little creature had just disappeared. The women were never afraid. They just thought the whole thing was weird.\nThe next time the Little Man was sighted, it was in the small village of Str\u00e5kan in Norrbotten in Sweden, a small community of around 10 farms and houses. At 6 pm on February 16, twenty year-old \u00c5ke Westberg was waiting for the bus at the stop near his parents' home. He would travel a few kilometers (1.5 miles) to collect milk. This evening it was very dark outside. When \u00c5ke was standing there waiting for the bus, he saw a small dark-clad man further away. He could not see the man's face. He called out because he thought it might be someone he knew, but got no answer. Then he moved a little closer. When he was about 20 - 15 meters (60 - 45 feet), he heard a scary growl from the person. Then he also saw that the man had a large square box on his stomach. From this it suddenly came a strong white light, which blinded \u00c5ke, so he had to turn away. The light lasted for a minute or so and when he was able to open his eyes again he saw that the whole road behind him bathed in light almost 500 meters (547 yards) away, and the light was so intense that he could not see his own shadow against the snow. When the light finally disappeared, so did the Little Man. Puzzled, \u00c5ke then stood and waited for the bus, which then arrived after a few minutes. When he returned home after getting the milk, he fetched the hunting rifle and went out to look, but found no little man.\n\u00c5ke\u00b4s picture of the being he encounter at the bus stop. (source: UFO-Information)\n\u00c5ke had a vague idea of \u200b\u200bwhat the man looked like, but he described that he was dressed in black and seemed to be a bit clumsy. He also had something black on his head, but what could not be seen. On his stomach the man had a square box, from which the light came. The same evening that \u00c5ke saw the man, when he was about to go to bed, he had severe pain in all the joints of his body and could not sleep. At one point during the night it felt like he was paralyzed. Finally he fell asleep and when he woke up in the morning the pain was gone and everything was as usual.\nAnother one of \u00c5ke\u00b4s sketches. Showing the being from the front. (source: UFO-Information)\nOn the evening of February 27, Ann-Marie Lindb\u00e4ck drove her car on the road between Haparanda and \u00d6verkalix near the Finnish border. When she was near the roadside tavern Three Seashells, she suddenly saw a small man standing by the roadside in front of her. Ann-marie could see that the man was wearing a dark coat, with a dark hood or helmet on his head. She managed to see that he had a kind of box on his stomach, then she was blinded by a bright light and she braked the car. It lasted a few seconds, and when it was gone the little man was no longer there. Ann-Marie stayed in the car for five minutes, watching for the man, waiting to see if he came back, but he never did. At last she drove on\u2026\nMany years later, a letter came to UFO-Sweden from a man named Lars-Olof Gustavsson. He said that sometime at the end of February 1971, he was driving with his wife on road 97 from Boden towards Lule\u00e5. As they neared Gammelstad and came close to a narrow bridge over a river, they saw a bright light 300 meters (330 yards) away from an oncoming car. His wife who was driving the car was dazzled. But instead of getting closer, the oncoming light veered off to the right and then disappeared without a trace. When they arrived at the place where the light disappeared there was no side road in any direction. It was just a straight road. Instead, they saw a dark figure standing by the side of the road. It was 1 meter (3 feet) tall and looked like a straight cabinet with a yellow-green square glowing hatch in the middle. Lars-Olof shouted: \"Look, the Little Man!\" His wife passed by without stopping. When they reached their friends in Gammelstad, they told them about the mysterious event and they drove back with the friends and looked. But then there was no dark figure left.\nWas it a wierd dark metal casing or a strange creature dressed in black they saw? (source: UFO-Sweden)\nIn the middle of April 1971 another report came in. This time it was from Finland near Kierinki, about 100 kilometers (62 miles) from the Swedish border. At 9.30 pm in the evening, Timo Alamartin was out driving his tractor after working late in the forest. Suddenly he saw a man in the middle of the road. He thought it was his brother, as he was also nearby. When he got closer, he saw that the man was wearing what he thought looked like a dark fur hat on his head. The hat was pulled down far over the eyes, so Timo couldn't see a face. And the figure on the road appeared to be no more than 1 meter (3 feet) tall. It was now right in front of the hood of the tractor, so Timo backed up a bit to get the figure back into the headlight from the tractor, so he could see better. But when he backed up, the little man was still right in front of the hood. Timo swerved and backed up several times, but no matter what he did, the figure remained in front of the nose of the tractor. Now Timo also felt how the creature pushed the tractor, as if it was trying to get it over the snow bank and into the ditch. Now Timo got angry and jumped out of the tractor. With determined steps and a wrench in hand, he walked towards the front of the tractor. But when he got there, the little man had disappeared without a trace. No traces of the man could be seen in the newly fallen snow on the road either. Timo now became very scared. It was one of the few times in his life that he felt that way. He had read several articles about the \"Little Man\" in the newspaper and thought it was this creature that he had met. Shaken, he drove home to tell his wife.\nMany people claimed they observed a Little Man in black clothing with a strange box on his chest, at the side of the roads in northen Sweden and Finland that winter of 1971. (artistic impression)\nThere were also those who claimed to have spoken to the Little Man. The newspaper Norrbotten-Kuriren reported on 10 March 1971 about a man in Kursu in north-eastern Finland, who saw the strange figure in his kitchen. On April 15, 1970 at 5 pm, forest worker and locally known athlete Kalle Tiihonen was sitting in his kitchen drinking coffee. He heard a noise that was similiar to a swarm of bees. He had his back to the kitchen door and was suddenly beginning to feel watched. He turned and saw a small man of 1 meter (3 feet) standing in the doorway. The being wore a green shimmering jumpsuit and on its head it had what looked like a helmet. It also had big, nasty eyes, but Kalle wasn't scared, mostly surprised, and started talking to the creature. He asked questions about space and whether the creature knew if the US astronauts in the Apollo capsule could return to Earth. Kalle also wondered where the little man came from. \"From the universe.\" was the answer. After promising to return, the little man left. Throughout the conversation, it was as if he had the words projected into his own head by the creature. Kalle Tiihonen's eight-year-old son was sitting in the next room and heard the father talking to someone, but he heard no one answer. The son also claims to have seen a small saucer-like craft land and take off in the backyard. Even Kalle's wife, who was in the barn at the time, had also heard a strange humming sound. According to the family, they also found tracks left in the snow from the spaceship. After the incident, Kalle Tiihonen was unable to sleep for three nights in a row, and experienced a sort of malaise for over a week. Footnote: The description of the being in this sighting is very similar to the humanoid seen in Imj\u00e4rvi in \u200b\u200bJanuary 1970.\nIn connection with the observations of the Little Man, there were also several reports of mysterious lights from orbs in northern Sweden and Finland during this period. In Finland, as in Ylistaro for example, strange tracks were also seen in the snow in several places where UFO:s were sighted. These looked like an elephant walking in the snow and they went a little way and then stopped abruptly, as if the creature that made the tracks just went up in smoke or flew away. People also saw remnants of what they thought were landing sites, with large areas of melted snow. Discolorations of yellow-red residue were also visible in the snow, and there was a smell of sulfur in the area.\nMysterious \\\"elephant\\\" tracks were found in Finland at a few occasions. (UFO-Information)\nOne naturally wonders about the veracity of all these reports that were made about the Little Man during 1970-71. But they contain many features in common with other UFO and humanoid sightings worldwide. The reports about the Little Man are fascinating and interesting in many ways and remind a little of the Nordic legends about Elves, Gnomes and Trolls. And it also seems that other UFO stories about creatures are woven into this one, such as the Ufonaut in Kinnula and the being in Imj\u00e4rvi, as some descriptions are similar to these. The story of the Little Man of the North became a legend in itself and is one of the most famous humanoid cases in the Nordics and was even heard of abroad.\nSources: UFO-Sverige, UFO Information no 2 \u2013 1971, Mervi Virtanen\nSmall green mummies.\nNiv\u00e5, Near Copenhagen, September 28, 1988.\nThis interesting report came from an elderly lady and SUFOI (Scandinavian UFO Information) received it first in December 1995, five years after it happened. The woman said that on this Monday evening in September 1988 she had been to a meeting in Copenhagen and drove alone in the car to her home in Hornb\u00e6k. It was late at night and it was raining a lot. At approximately 11:30 PM, she arrived at the coastal village of Niv\u00e5 on the way home. As she drove on Gammel Strandvej (Old Beach Road) that passed through the small quiet community, the rain poured down, the windshield wipers went full speed and she had to slow down a lot to see how she was driving.\nSuddenly, in the car's headlights, she saw two thin and short creatures (0,5 \u2013 0,6 meters/ 1.65 \u2013 1.95 feet) standing by a gutter grate through which the water on the street flowed down. They gestured at each other with their hands, as if they were having a lively discussion. The small humanoids were clad in a full body suit, and it almost looked like they were wrapped from head to toe, like mummies, in a shiny, olive green, plastic-like fabric similar to bandages. Even the eyes, nose and mouth were covered by this \"bandage\". They had large, almost egg-shaped heads that tapered slightly towards the chin, and had slender arms ending in a large finger and thumb, and legs with feet that were long and pointed.\nThe elderly woman made a picture of the beings she caught a glimpse of in the rain at the side of the road that night. (source: UFO-Nyt)\nThe woman was very surprised and turned her head around, while driving the car. She couldn't believe what she was seeing and she wanted to see the small, strange beings again, but now she had already passed by and had to drive a little further down the road to turn around. Where Stationsvej crossed Gammel Strandvej, she could then turn the car around. But when she thought of driving back to the place where she saw the creatures, she got an inexplicable anxiety. Instead, she turned the car in the other direction again and continued home. So, unfortunately, the woman was not able to confirm what it was she saw. But it is also not certain that the beings would have remained if she drove back. The woman estimates the entire course of events to be approximately 2 - 3 minutes.\nIn the report there are some things that are strange. The woman claims that the gutter grate was approximately 50 \u2013 100 meters (55 \u2013 110 yards) from the place she turned, which should be in the middle of the village of Niv\u00e5 (see picture). Thus, she should have seen the creatures again when she turned the car around. But she never mentioned this in the report. Or was it raining too much and was too dark for her to see anything? Or was the observation point instead at the fields and meadows just before entering Niv\u00e5, because she says that the sequence of events took 2 - 3 minutes? It doesn't take that long to drive 50 \u2013 100 meters. Unless she sat in the car for a long time and waited before driving home again? Also, could it have been small children in wet raincoats that she saw? This is less likely because small children are probably not out playing at this time, especially not by a road in the dark.\nThe place in the small community of Niv\u00e5, where the encounter allegedly happened. (source: Google Maps)\nWhat is also interesting to speculate about, is that this is not the first time that humanoids dressed in something similar to bandages have been observed. The aliens in the Pascagoula abduction case in the US and \"The fanged humanoids of Kofu\" in Japan had similar suits. But unlike these two sightings, no UFO was observed in the Niv\u00e5 case.\nFinally, what happened in eastern Denmark this late evening in 1988 was a very fascinating observation, but unfortunately it contains some question marks. However, SUFOI assessed the elderly lady as honest and trustworthy and that she had indeed seen something that she could not explain. But will we ever know what?\nSources: UFO-Nyt no 2 1994, https://hiddenmark.dk/ufos/the-nivaa-mummies/\nArtistic impression of the small humanoids running around in the country side outside of Niv\u00e5 that dark, rainy night.\n\u201dRed is the morning!\u201d\nOslo, Norway, May 2006.\nThis is a report that does not involve a UFO or craft of any kind, but only a mysterious entity. It is unclear if this should be classified as an alien sighting or if it more belongs in the Supernatural category. Anyway, here is the story:\nAn evening in May the 17-year old witness was on his way to a local cinema named \u201dEl Dorado\u201d, located in central Oslo with two of his friends. He was feeling kind of tired from not sleeping well, but otherwise felt fine. At about 500 meters (545 yards) away from the cinema the streets suddenly went quiet, which was very strange since this was a very busy Saturday. The teenager looked around him and did not see a single person, even his friends were gone. When he turned around he saw a 2 meter (6.5 feet) tall \u201cperson\u201d dressed in a blood red outfit in front of him. The man had no face or hair, the only thing on its head was a round shaped metal object on what would have been its forehead. Except from this the figure looked like a middle age male. The suit was seamless and the texture looked like wool. The being started to walk towards the witness and then suddenly all the people in the street returned and red dressed entity was gone. Shocked the witness again saw his friends and asked them what had happened. They did not understand what he was talking about, and thought he was a little crazy, since at no time had they noticed anything strange.\nSuddenly all cars and everyone around the teenager disappeared and the only one left on the street was a strange being in a red jumpsuit\\/ overall. (artistic impression)\nA few days later the witness was awakened by his\u00a0cell phone\u00a0ringing. He answered the phone and got no reply. He said hello once more and heard strange unexplainable noises. It was a sound he had never heard before that he is unable to describe in detail. When the mysterious sounds ceased he turned off his phone and dozed off again. When he woke up that morning he noticed that his cellphone was still on. He checked the incoming and outgoing calls and saw nothing.\n2 weeks later the teenager had almost forgotten the incidents and he was now on the subway (T-Bane) on his way to see a friend. Suddenly the eerie quietness returned, and the same strange entity was now sitting in the opposite seat from him, a half meter (1.5 feet) away. It was wearing the same red suit. He still could not see a face, and the metallic disc on was still on its forehead. He then heard the sounds he had heard on the cellphone previously. They had no distinct direction or origin so he assumed they were telepathic. Suddenly the disc on the beings face opened and revealed a big eye, a human eye, but in a shade of red and violet. This scared the witness and he cried and screamed. The being seemed to ignore the witness\u2019s terrified state, and then it took his hand with an incredibly strong grip, but soft. The 17 year old tried to pull out of his grip, but to his surprise the being touched his hand with the other hand in an attempt to calm the witness, who stopped crying, but was still terrified. Then the entity uttered a strange phrase in Norwegian \u201cRod er morgenen!\u201d which directly translates to \u201cRed is the morning\u201d or \u201cThe morning is red\u201d. His voice sounded kind of neutral, not masculine or feminine. Then in a flash everything went back to normal. The witness looked around him, too afraid to do anything. He decided not to tell his friend about the encounter. He has not met the strange entity again.\nOnce again everyone around him were suddenly gone and the only one left was the sinister being in red.\nWhatever happen or who or what the strange entity was no one knows. Or was there even an creature to begin with? Was this only something from the teenagers imagination? Or did he take drugs or hallucinated? Where this story came from originally and who wrote it is unclear. So we do not have any details of the witness or character judgment from Paranormal-investigators. So this might just as well be only a made up story, having its own life on the net.\nSource: Thinkaboutit\nThe alien assailants.\nVihti, southern Finland, September 30, 2018.\nFinland is the place in the Nordics for many strange close encounters. This is yet another and this was a terrifying and bizarre incident that happened in a small town in the south of the country, where people were attacked in their own homes by unknown assailants. It is such an incredible story, with both classic alien abduction elements and bits of demonic possession, that it is almost hard to believe. And again, a heads up to sensitive readers.\nIt was evening and a family was watching TV when suddenly it went black and all the lights in the house went out. And the computer didn't work either. It seemed like all the electricity in the whole house was gone. The father of the family walked over to the living room window and looked out. Outside he saw something very strange, a dark object the size of a car and with red and blue pulsating lights, hovering low over the ground some distance from the house.\nThe man's wife then headed for the front door. Suddenly it opened and in the doorway stood two menacing creatures. They resembled humans in size and appearance and were dressed in what looked like black overalls. But there the similarity ended. Where their face should be there was nothing, only darkness. It was as if someone had taken an eraser and erased their eyes, noses and mouths. The man in the family commanded angrily the intruders to leave their house. The wife remained and screamed in panic to the husband to run upstairs and save their daughter.\nWhen they opened the front door, two large, menacing men in black stood outside. (artistic impression)\nSuddenly, the two black-clad strangers stormed into the house. When the father of the family tried to run away, the intruders sent a beam of light, and the man was unable to move and fell and ended up paralyzed on the floor. Then the strangers came forward and installed some kind of metal cage around the face of the downed man. The cage then started flashing a white light and the man got a severe headache. The strangers then attacked the man's wife and dog. The woman began to behave strangely, as if she lost all emotions. As the man screamed in pain from the headache, his wife turned to him and said, \"You have no reason to scream. Then her eye color changed to red and they moved strangely. She got black rings around her eyes. After that the man fainted.\nWhen the man then woke up again, he was laying in his own bed with one of the intruders standing next to him. He was ordered to try to ejaculate on his own. The man tried, but was too shocked and nothing came out. After that he was dragged to his daughter's room downstairs. His wife and daughter were already in bed. They were wrapped in what looked like robes and they both had these strange black rings around their eyes. He heard his wife and daughter say something to him. But it was monotonous and without emotion in the voice, as if they had become robots. The man again shouted at them that they must get away from here, but to no avail. He was crying in frustration at this nightmare he had gotten himself into.\nThen he was again dragged up the stairs to his bedroom. The intruders now began to perform a medical procedure and they stuck something up his rectum. When he tried to resist, they hit him in the face so hard they broke his nose. When they dragged him out into the corridor to the toilet, he saw himself in the mirror, he was naked and covered in blood on his face. The black-clad told the man that they needed his seed, so they could make human offspring in the laboratory. The man was again ordered to produce something manually on his own. But in this state that the man was in, he could not. The strangers then brought out something looked like a black stone, and with this they stroked the man's body and face, and the man's bruises, wounds and broken nose were healed at once. After this, the two men left the house as quickly as they had arrived. They never came back. The man never forgot this event that left a deep mark, but neither his wife nor daughter had any memory of what happens to them this terrible night or of the violent assailants.\nWas the car-sized black object with blue and red pulsating lights, that the man saw hovering outside, a UFO? (artistic impression)\nWhat happened this evening and why is very difficult to understand. And who were the intruders? Other than the man seeing a mysterious object outside that flashed red and blue, there is no indication that the strangers were aliens. They might as well have been only human. And maybe this assault had a more earthly nature of a criminal kind and the man was confused of their intentions? Perhaps the father of the family owed someone money or was involved in some organized crime and clashed with someone who wanted to take revenge or warn him? Or has the man made it all up or imagined everything? Or was he suffering from mental problems? There are so many questions to this story and few answers. But the man insisted that those who attacked the family that evening were not human and not from this Earth.\nSource: MUFON", "media": null, "score": 60, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comment_count": 3, "over_18": false}, "42": {"id": "1g2q1x7", "locked": false, "subreddit": "cryptids", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "CealBlanc", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1729306859.2019129, "created_utc": 1728827374.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/wudpkkjc3jud1.jpeg", "title": "I met Sasquatch yesterday at the SC Bigfoot Festival", "permalink": "/r/cryptids/comments/1g2q1x7/i_met_sasquatch_yesterday_at_the_sc_bigfoot/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 311, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comment_count": 20, "over_18": false}, "43": {"id": "1g3g9wk", "locked": false, "subreddit": "thetruthishere", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Velvet-Pebble", "link_flair_text": "Unidentified?", "time": 1729306859.444827, "created_utc": 1728913939.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1g3g9wk/theres_something_in_my_garden/", "title": "There's something in my garden", "permalink": "/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1g3g9wk/theres_something_in_my_garden/", "selftext": "I'm\u00a0freaking out a bit.

Primarily Hispanic, everyone knew everything, we had somethinga here and there of course but other than that not too much stuff happens. \nIm overweight to put it simply. And not to the standards of beauty really. I remember reading a meme online once where it was a joke about \u201ccan\u2019t catch me or kidnap since you can\u2019t carry me, keep eating cake!\u201d And laughed at that and was like \u201cso true.\u201d God. Didn\u2019t realize that would come back and bite me. \nI was 18-19ish I believe and it was night time. My weed plug was doing a stash and dash and being broke and desperate, I went for it! I figured \u201cI grew up here, I know all the areas!\u201d And what made this more tempting was it was actually not far from my area at all. So I said fuck it! Was on a video call with my boyfriend and told him I was gonna go for it. He stays on the phone with me and I head out. Mind you, it\u2019s late, the areas I have to cross through are not well lit, and I leave with nothing on me. Not even my taser, alarm, and pepper spray my dad always made me have. Oh and to make things worse, I snuck out because didn\u2019t want my dad to know i was hunting for weed- \nSo this is already starting out great. So I set off! I have to cross railroad tracks to get through to the area which is pitch black, only the main road in the distance lighting it up and some lights from a warehouse near by, but other than that it is hard to see. I make my way towards the main road and notice a semi parked on the side of the road. Not unusual, semis parked there all the time, ever since I was little so nothing too weird. Then I hear \u201cHola! Hey!\u201d \nI look over and see a man in a semi truck. He looked generic. I\u2019m not gonna lie, a Mexican man with a red long sleeve. He looked like any other man I\u2019d see around town. But his smile. I don\u2019t know. He was just off.\nI waved, being polite. He gestured for me to come over and starts speaking Spanish. But I don\u2019t know Spanish. I know what you\u2019re thinking \u201cone, why don\u2019t you know Spanish if you grew up in a Hispanic town, and two why aren\u2019t you running?\u201d\nParents never taught me, sue me, and two he was far so I just kept walking. \nSo I just sheepishly respond I don\u2019t speak Spanish, in Spanish- (I learned that phrase just to say it to people) and wave him off quickly walking away. \nMy boyfriend asks me who\u2019s that and I just tell him some random semi truck driver. \nI go on with the night, I think I\u2019ve been out for 40 minutes at this point, and realize I\u2019m not going to find it. Big sad. Start heading home. Still on the phone with my boyfriend I keep talking and my phone is dying, which is actually what made my boyfriend tell me to go home. So I start walking back. I go down the road and look down the pitch black area where the railroad is and I stopped. I just had a bad feeling. Something told me to not go home just yet. I tell my boyfriend I\u2019m gonna go look at the other end of the street. That was towards where the warehouse was, giving off the light, passing empty trailers partially hidden by the shadows. \nI start walking make it into the light and I hear movement behind me and \u201chey.\u201d I turned around hella quick and saw the same semi truck driver, with the same smile he had. He came out from behind a trailer he was hiding behind, he had his right hand tucked in his pocket and was positioning his body to where he was hiding whatever he had more. He told me to \u201ccome here\u201d and started getting closer to me. \nI immediately tell my boyfriend to wake up his dad and come get me. I backed up quick and was trying so hard to think. He saw me on the phone and immediately had a mad and annoyed look on his face. He stopped and actually started hiding behind the trailers more. So I book it down the road telling my boyfriend to come get me or have his dad come get me. I didn\u2019t want to call me dad because even in this moment for some reason I was still terrified of getting caught sneaking out. I ran across the main road to the little mini mart across the street and hid behind an ice machine. I told my boyfriend I need to call someone and hang up on him, and call my friend who thank god was out with his girlfriend. I tell him I\u2019m in danger and need him to come get me, tell him where I\u2019m at. \nWhile I was waiting for them, I stayed behind the ice machine and saw his semi. I saw him look around for me , and shake his head in disappointment before driving off. Even in that moment I didn\u2019t feel safe, not until my friend pulled up. Everything hit me once he got out the car and I hugged him crying. His girlfriend and him calmed me down and took me home. Got a little lecture from my boyfriend but I\u2019d rather take the lecture than anything else. \nI was lucky. Way too lucky. The false sense of security my weight and looks gave me really shattered after that. And I\u2019m glad for it. it terrfies me to think of how things could\u2019ve turned out if I didn\u2019t have my boyfriend on the phone with me. \nSo, Semi Truck Driver, let\u2019s not meet. I never want to see that smile ever again.

I used to go on a run down this long open road in north-east Tennessee that was pretty open with only fields on the side and barely any houses. I would run this same route every single day as I was really training hard before joining the army. One day I planned on taking it off but had this weird feel of motivation to go on this run that was sitting with me nearly all day. I chalked it up to only being as that - motivation. So its now 3pm which is a lot later than my normal runs (which were usually either around 6am or 8am). I'm running about 3 miles in and I look down at my phone to change the song and out of NOWHERE I run into someone. The man who was the same height as me, he had this long beard and a pretty large stature was on the ground and I help him up. I say \"My bad sir, I didn't see anyone else around here\" He says \"All good\" then looks up to me and it looked like he had just seen a ghost. I have never seen fear like this in someone unless I was playing scare pranks on someone. He just had a wide mouth and eyes looking at me as he got up and he stuck his hand out. I didn't know what he was doing and said \"take care, sorry again\".\nFast forward around 10 years later, I have been in the army now for 6 years. I have a religious exemption to grow my beard, I began actually lifting weights a lot more. feeling well, doing well. Holiday block leave comes around and I got the feeling that I really should go back home to visit my family, as I hadn't actually went back home since 2019 because flying out of Hawaii was just way to expensive and back then I was a poor private. Now I'm stationed closer to home, and a SGT with some money. I flew into East-Tennessee and am staying at a hotel. On the third day, It's nice out and the air smells nostalgic as its the start of fall season and I kept thinking about the old home I stayed in with my parents about 30 minutes away, which my mom's ex boyfriend still lives in. So its around noon, I had dinner and decided to go visit and see how he and his kids are doing all these years later. I go and sit and talk with them all for a while, and we drink a couple beers for the hell of it. I then decided, I wanna go check out my old running route. No idea why I thought to do this but oh well, might as well. I tell him I'm going to go walk my old running route as it was nostalgic and I feel it did very well for me and my future army career as a young adult. I'm walking and it's dead silent. Slight wind out and just beautiful fields all around me. All of a sudden I felt like I got tackled out of nowhere. There was no-one in sight as far as I had known. Then I hear \"My bad sir, I didn't see anyone else around here\" I'm looking at the ground for my phone which had fallen out of my hand and say \"all good\"... That's when I looked up to the kid and immediately felt like the world turned upside down.. almost like a panic attack is taking over me. Nothing feels real. I notice the kid... IT WAS LITERALLY ME! I tried to speak but my mouth had gone so dry I just couldn't say anything so I reached out weirdly just wanting to touch my younger self. He looked at my hand, smiled and said \"Take care, sorry again\" put his headphone back in and took off running. I stood there for literally only like 3 seconds to piece my brain back together then yelled \"Joe come back!\" and went running to catch up to him but to never see them again... yet this is an open road, he couldn't have gotten too far but was vanished. This has been sitting with me ever since (few days ago) as though its like some weird dream and I can't get over it.\nHas this happened with anyone else?

I stood in front of the sink and mirror to brush my teeth. As I looked into the mirror, I blacked out. Not in the physical sense, my body was frozen as if in fear and saw a scene that went like this;\u00a0\nI was seeing a pov of myself floating in space, surrounded by stars and dark space. Directly in front of me, but quite far away, I saw a house. A house floating in space. It was a stereotypical house. A red wooden door right in the middle with a window on each side. Green bushes at the front. I was floating closer to the house, almost like zooming in on it. I got closer and closer and when I got right up to door, it opened and I saw this face of a woman with black hair. She was old and her face made me feel fear like I\u2019ve ever felt before. As soon as I saw her face, she screamed, and I \u201cwoke up\u201d. I was looking at myself in the bathroom mirror again. I was still frozen in fear, similar to the feeling of waking up from a nightmare and not being able to move or scream. (But maybe that\u2019s not a universal experience). \nAnyway, I think it must have lasted a few seconds, maybe a minute. But it felt like forever. It took me a moment to compose myself and try get ready for school. The following morning when I woke up, it happened again. This carried on for a few weeks (if memory serves me correctly). It became intermittent, with days in between that were normal. Every time it was the same thing; space, the house, the door, the screaming old woman. People I\u2019ve told this story to have always asked me what she looked like, if I knew her. But I didn\u2019t. Her face was hard to describe. The best comparison I can make is to the uncanny. Almost like an AI generated face that was randomized and just looks kind of off. Something almost human, that should be human, but has something about it that isnt. That feeling took over my body. The fear was almost unbearable.\nIt was almost like losing consciousness, having a vision, I don\u2019t exactly know. But my body didn\u2019t fall to the floor, I just froze, my eyes stayed open, but what I saw around me was not my bathroom.\u00a0\nI told my parents about it, they didn\u2019t know what to think. And I doubt I could describe it as well as I can now.\u00a0\nThey told me to wait, see if it happens again. They chopped it up to something like being half asleep and still dreaming.\u00a0\nFor a few days it didn\u2019t happen, and I thought it had finally stopped. Then, one Sunday afternoon, I was in the living room with my dad. He was watching a soccer game. I was at the desk area behind the couch, packing some things away. And it happened again. The same as it always did, the fear, freezing, space, the house, the women. When I came around, I just cried. I went over to my dad who noticed something was wrong. I told him that it happened again. It was now happening during the day, while I was very awake, and around my family. Aka I should feel safe, which in my mind rules out anything about me being in a sleep-wake state or \u201cstill dreaming\u201d.\u00a0\nThey took me to my doctor, who listened to my story and also didn\u2019t really have any answers. He told me to wait it out.\u00a0\nAfter seeing my doctor, it didn\u2019t really happen for a long time. I thought that really explaining it to someone must have released whatever hold it had on me. About a year or 2 later we relocated overseas for my dad\u2019s job. I was 14.\u00a0\nThe last time it happened was the first morning moving into our new house.\u00a0\nSince that day, it hasn\u2019t happened again. I\u2019m now 27 and still have no answers.\u00a0\nIf anyone has any answers for me, or has had a similar experience, or maybe can refer me to a space/community where I can find answers about this, please let me know!!\u00a0", "media": null, "score": 34, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comment_count": 9, "over_18": false}, "70": {"id": "1g5fq5f", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ghosts", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "dub_paetz", "link_flair_text": "Captured Apparition ", "time": 1729306885.5730052, "created_utc": 1729129145.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/fjjsylmp08vd1.jpeg", "title": "Alaska backcountry ghostly image from last night", "permalink": "/r/Ghosts/comments/1g5fq5f/alaska_backcountry_ghostly_image_from_last_night/", "selftext": "My friend Sarah lives in the Alaska backcountry.
