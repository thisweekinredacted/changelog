The text below is the back and forth interview conducted and translated as it appears in the FSR edition. Note: The comments 'G.C.' within this post refer to FSR editor Gordon Creighton.\nWe learned recently from a Sr. Luis T., Rodriguez of Sabana Grande that, according to an informant known to him, this informant had witnessed the kidnapping of a man near Tallaboa, between the towns of Ponce and Pe\u00f1uelas, in the southern part of the Island of Puerto Rico.\nThis informant, named H\u00e9ctor Maldonado, a resident of Ponce, was a night-time employee of a local firm. After very great difficulty, due to his pronounced evasiveness, I did finally manage to contact this man Maldonado (aged 39, resident on Calle Isabel, Ponce), and gradually extract from him the details of his story and get him to take me to the spot where it had happened. It had been at about 9.00 o'clock one morning in November 1979, and he was out jogging near the saltings and mangrove thickets of Ponce Salt, near Tallaboa, and right by the sea, on the southern coast of Puerto Rico Island.\nHe said: \"I chanced to turn round suddenly, and there were five or six strange beings there, between 5 ft and 6ft tall, thin, with bald, biggish heads, big almond-shaped glowing eyes - just as though lit up with bright lights - not in the slightest bit normal! It was broad daylight, so it was not a case of some sort of light reflected in their eyes in the way it is at night with animal eyes. That light came from inside their eyes!\" (He does not give the actual colour -G.C.)\n\"They had thin necks and long arms, and long hands and fingers. I didn't note how many fingers - I was too shaken to notice it. The strangest thing was that their skin was a greyish-blue colour. I couldn't see any clothing on them - unless that greyish-blue stuff was itself something that covered their entire body, but to me they looked naked. I spotted no sign of any genitals at any time, though to be honest I didn't fix my attention specially on that.\u201c\n\"The astonishing thing was that they had got hold of a man and were taking him off. He was a human, olive-skinned, about 5ft 9 in height, with lank black hair, and apparently unconscious. He looked as if he were petrified, with his eyes closed, and they had got hold of him by the armpits. They appeared to be very strong, because two of them were lifting him off the ground with ease. He wasn't even dragging his feet; I didn't get a clear view of his face, because I could only see him from the side. \"Behind the beings, above the sea, a bit beyond the mangroves, there was a machine hanging stationary in the air. It looked more or less oval in shape, with a cupola on top, and its sides sort of fluted or grooved, and on the top it had a narrow, curved, projection with lots of lights - just like a garland of lights that you see at Christmas time. The thing was of a silvery metallic colour, and big - really big. And just hanging there in the air, not making a sound.\"\n\"Suddenly one of them, who had been kneeling and seemed to be looking at something on the ground, got up and signed to me, and then I felt something as if it were inside my mind, like a voice, - but a bit strange - different from that - coming seemingly from that being. And I heard him say jestingly to the others: 'LOOK AT THAT ONE - HOW HE'S RUNNING'.\" (The eyewitness had in fact not stopped jogging).\n\"AND THEN THE BEING HIMSELF STARTED RUNNING, AND MAKING FUN OF ME. Then I got the impression that he said: 'Now - just look how I run,' and he started moving at a quite fantastic speed. Then he halted beside the others, and in my mind I heard him say to them 'WE'LL TAKE HIM TOO. The others replied something like: 'Not him - leave him alone'. ... Something like that. When he was mocking me he had got great big teeth - and pointed ones \u2014 like a shark's teeth.\u201d (See the sketch based on the eyewitness's description).\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3p95qq6wge1d1.png?width=530&format=png&auto=webp&s=929714dd8086fc5f2afca2947f772b5d634f0cf5\n\"Next\", he said, \"That one that had laughed at me and wanted to take me, gestured towards me with his hand and threw something like a great big drop of some sort of cold liquid, which hit me on the chest. Where that had hit me, I at once began to feel very queer - as though my body was swelling up and I was feeling stiff. Like a sort of cramp. But I was so scared that I forced myself to keep on running. And, as I went on, that queer feeling began to lessen, and so I was able to go on.\u201d\n\"And when I did look back, I saw that they were taking the man towards that craft. I just carried on running, and didn't want to look back, and when I did finally look back next, the craft, and they and the man were all gone. And I just carried on running until I'd got right away from there. \"I was terrified. And I didn't tell a soul about it. I was so scared, and felt sure that nobody would believe me. Who was going to believe a story like that? They'd say I was mad, and I wasn't going to expose myself to that, No Se\u00f1or!\"\nWe asked Maldonado to give us more details of the man they were carrying off.\nHe said: \"Well, he was olive-skinned, with black hair. I don't think he would have been more than about 30. Slim. He was wearing a two-piece suit, with a check pattern, and of a creamy sort of shade. But I didn't get a clear view of his face because - as I've told you - he was sideways on to me all the time. And yes - the man was unconscious or dead. I imagine unconscious\".\nWe asked: \"Didn't you notify the Police about what you had seen?\"\n\"No\", he replied. \"As I've already told you, I was very scared. I didn't think they would believe me. For a long time I have felt bad about what might have happened to that chap that they were taking, because I've no doubt whatsoever that they were indeed taking him. But my fear was too great, and I did nothing. For a long time I carried in my mind the scene of what happened. I couldn't stop thinking about it. But bit by bit I got control of myself and was able to bear it\".\nI asked: \"Did you continue to go jogging at that place?\"\nHe replied: \"For a long time I didn't go back there, but after three years, when I was feeling calmer, I did go back there. \"One day, I was running there again, on that same sector, and I fell down suddenly, because there was a change of level in the soil there. And when I looked to see the cause, I perceived that the soil there had sunk, forming a perfect circle about 100ft. in diameter. It looked just as though something large and heavy had rested there. I was astonished to see that, but I also noticed that over on the further edge of the circle some individuals with a red minibus belonging to the Civil Defence Dept. were checking the circle. That was around 1982 or May 1983. It's near the place on the salt-flats where they spread out the shrimps in the sun.\u201d\n\"After that, I lingered there for a while, and talked to those people, and to others, all of whom had seen UFOs thereabouts. \"Furthermore, when I read of other things that you had investigated and that you had published previously in the review ENIGMA, showing more or less similar beings that have been seen in the Island and in other places, by other people, then I realized that I wasn't the only one to have seen them.\u201d\n\"It's true, and for some reason the Governments hide it and cover it up. But as I see it, there's far too much going on, and in the end they are going to have to give some sort of explanation and say what it is that is going on.\"\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i2s5sskzge1d1.png?width=362&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b9d605ed3dcb1cb38120cec567803b2dae61f7f", "media": null, "score": 94, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comment_count": 23, "over_18": false}, "10": {"id": "1cxol7c", "locked": false, "subreddit": "cryptids", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "Immediate-Sky-5032", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1716715617.4289055, "created_utc": 1716341703.0, "url": "https://v.redd.it/wzvx1tw2tv1d1", "title": "Louisiana panther", "permalink": "/r/cryptids/comments/1cxol7c/louisiana_panther/", "selftext": "Seen awhile back but just found the video.

I was just eight years old and my younger sister was three. We were playing along with other kids who lived in the same building as us, just on different floors. The building is not exactly an apartment building, it's more of a multi-storeyed house.\nThe front gate is a bit further from there and the only entrance and exit of the building. So, since we were downstairs and playing, anybody who would enter or exit the building would be visible to us and we'd greet them because every tenant knows us and we know them, as well as their family members who might visit them. A new person visiting any tenant is rare but not impossible. Right adjacent to the big entrance gate is a small old-style window with grill but it has a small opening at the bottom.\nWe were all playing but then I got tired and sat on one of the chairs placed at the porch-like place (Not sure what to call it tbh), from where the window thingy falls on my right side and I can see it as well as the gate clearly. I was just looking out when I noticed a man staring at the gate which looks similar to this, so basically he was able to look at my sister and friends through it. It concerned me when I realised that he wasn't even trying to look away and just staring at them blankly. I turned around from where I was sitting, to signal my friend to move to the other side away from his sight which she didn't understand. Frustrated I turned back and was about to stand up when my gaze fell on the guy and he was now staring at me. My body froze and I could feel fear creeping up on me. I couldn't move, I don't know why I stared back at him and suddenly he started smiling and when I say smiling I mean full on grinning from ear to ear. That scared the soul out of me and I mustered some courage, got up and ran towards my friends. I didn't tell them anything and just asked them to go upstairs with me which thankfully they did without questioning.\nI didn't tell anything about this to my parents because I thought they would stop me from going downstairs to play. The next day, we again came to play and I looked through the window just to make sure he wasn't there. Fortunately, he wasn't- or so I thought. Fifteen minutes in, and I spot that guy again. He was again standing at the very spot and staring at us. At me. I tried to play it cool because my friends knew nothing about him but I couldn't for long and we went back again. From what I remember, this happened for three to four days and now my friends started complaining about how I don't let them play and that they have to come back earlier than they are supposed to.\nOn the fifth day (or fourth I don't remember correctly), I made up my mind to not pay attention to him and just focus on playing. We were playing cricket that evening and I was batting. I hit the ball hard causing it to go over the gate (which was a very normal thing) and as per rules made by us, the one responsible must fetch the ball. My heart started beating because I could see his grin getting wider and creepier, he went towards the ball on the road and picked it up. He then held his hand out gesturing me to come and take, I was shit scared at this point but I had to go so I did. As soon as I reached to take the ball from his hand, he bent coming close to my ear and his words are still ringing clearly in my ears till this day, \"I'm a good man. Look at the window when you go inside. I'll leave something for you.\" (This is a rough translation in English, it sounded much worse)\nThat sent shivers down my spine and I ran with the speed of light. After we were done playing, I saw him sliding a piece of paper from that little opening. He then looked at me, grinned and waved a bye. I grabbed the paper and opened it, he had written his phone number and asked me to call him sharp at two in the afternoon and that he knew my parents would be asleep by that time. It was also written that if I don't do it, my friends' lives would be in danger. As an eight year old, didn't know any better so I called him through my mother's phone. He picked up the call and I didn't have the courage to say anything so I was silent. He said, \"You're a good girl just like me. You should come stay with me. Come outside, I'm waiting to pick you up.\"\nBecause I lived upstairs, I went to the balcony and he was actually standing near the gate, looking directly at me waving and smiling. I couldn't contain it anymore so I started crying and disconnected the call. I ran inside and bawled my eyes out in my room. Thankfully, my mother didn't wake up and I cried it all out. I didn't go out for next few weeks and everybody kept asking me about it, I still didn't tell them though. That guy stopped coming too. I don't remember the time he stopped coming but he did and I was relieved. Eventually, this experience started fading and I grew up.\nFast forward to ten years. I was eighteen and my mother asked me to buy some snacks. I took my sister and went out. The shop I had to go to was at the end of the road, several houses away so not too far. I was standing in a queue when I felt uncomfortable because of the man standing behind me because he kept pushing me. Annoyed I looked at him only to realize it was the same man. My face went pale and I could feel my heart throbbing in my throat. I tried not to panic and calmed myself down by telling myself that he couldn't do anything in public, there were tons of people there and that gave me a sense of security. As soon as my order came, I took out my wallet hastily to pay but he beat me to it. The owner looked at him weirdly and then at me, because I was a regular there and he was seeing this man for the first time. I paid for it anyway and the owner politely asked him to take his money back. I gave the bag to my sister and asked her to go home and to inform our mom about a man following us.  Just in case, he attacks I'll have a backing and she would be safe too. Our house is within the vision range of the shop so I waited for her to get inside. And now, it was my turn to go home.\nAs soon as I stepped out, the man followed me and said something like, \"You're a beautiful lady now. Let's catch up.\" (Again rough translation) I kept walking and walking but now that we were far from the shop, he started speed walking and I had to walk faster. I could feel goosebumps all over my body. I started running and I could see him catching up to my speed when the owner called for him loudly saying that some of his money was still at the counter and asking him to come back which gave me enough time to get inside and lock the gate.\nI haven't seen him since that day and it's been two years. I'm twenty right now and I hope to never meet him anywhere in future. I hope I never see him again and I don't know why it has instilled a paranoia in me and I dread seeing him when I turn twenty-eight.\nEdit: I told my mom everything after that. Because my dad lives in another city for work, I didn't tell him since it would make him hella worried and possibly affect his work. My distant uncle is a local cop, he's quite close and trustworthy. We tried finding the creepy guy after that but couldn't. He literally vanished in thin air. We also asked the shop owner about him but he said the guy came back, took his money and went away. Nobody else paid enough attention to this guy so we couldn't find anything.\nI go to college by public transport so I have to walk around one kilometre to reach the stop. I take the other road, which is opposite to the road that leads to the shop, it takes longer comparatively but I feel better at least. Not once have I seen that guy or felt anything creepy since then which is a relief. But again I'm kind of paranoid everytime I step out, though I do carry pepper spray and a sharp keychain with me all the time. About moving out, we cannot afford that just yet.

Clean the sofa, put the tv on static mode, and make sure theres no pets or partners in the house. Now, bring the pool in the living room, and fill it with water. After doing that, put the mirror underwater and place the plush on it. Cover the pool with the blanket.\nIf it's 11:50 AM, wait 10 minutes.\nIf any other, wait longer. \nIf 12:00 AM hits, halfly open the blanket and fill the pool with red water using the sauce or the bath bomb. After it's fully red, place the blanket back and chant: \" The two, the two. I have prepared your requirements, come for a visit. \" 16 times. If you hear a slight step noise, they're here. If you dont hear anything move a bit away from the pool and do the chanting again. Now, when you hear the noise, close your eyes tightly, put your head a bit, but make sure not to make the blanket fall, on the blanket and think of your wish ( must not break laws of physics like flying, transforming and smth like that ) Do not stand up. Do not turn around. If you hear anything, stand up very slowly and quietly and hide under a table, bed, or anything safe. The two is now going to the pool to hear your words from the plush. They will see if you're worthy from the mirror's expections. And the water will grant you the wish. If they do think your worthy, take your prepared phone and watch the hour. After 02:00 AM, they will search for you. do not come out. Sleep like you normally do, but in your hiding place. Do not think about them. That will allow the two into the gate of your dreams or nightmares. When waking up, it shall be daylight. Take off the blanket, burn the plush to ashes, and break the mirror. Any weapons allowed. The water shall be gone and your wish shall be there. \nGood luck.", "media": null, "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "comment_count": 8, "over_18": false}, "14": {"id": "1cxj9g3", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ghosts", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Elizabethgreengurl88", "link_flair_text": "Captured Apparition ", "time": 1716715618.5424182, "created_utc": 1716326707.0, "url": "https://v.redd.it/svuphkfhku1d1", "title": "Captured a spirit walking behind my husband on security camera. \ud83d\udc40", "permalink": "/r/Ghosts/comments/1cxj9g3/captured_a_spirit_walking_behind_my_husband_on/", "selftext": "", "media": {"reddit_video": {"bitrate_kbps": 800, "fallback_url": "https://v.redd.it/svuphkfhku1d1/DASH_360.mp4?source=fallback", "has_audio": true, "height": 360, "width": 640, "scrubber_media_url": "https://v.redd.it/svuphkfhku1d1/DASH_96.mp4", "dash_url": "https://v.redd.it/svuphkfhku1d1/DASHPlaylist.mpd?a=1719307618%2COGM1NjU0ZmZhMGZiYjM0YWU0YTVlZDU4ZjcyZDI2OTE1OTM5MDBhZmM0ZDJjOThkNTNiMTE4YjQ2YzI0N2E5Nw%3D%3D&v=1&f=sd", "duration": 6, "hls_url": "https://v.redd.it/svuphkfhku1d1/HLSPlaylist.m3u8?a=1719307618%2CYTgxN2YzYWVjOWU4NDk5MmVmMDk3N2Y5OGE2OWZlZGIyZWQ1MzJmOWU1NzVhODA2YTFjNmUxMWYxYzU2ZjAzZQ%3D%3D&v=1&f=sd", "is_gif": false, "transcoding_status": "completed"}}, "score": 1135, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "comment_count": 208, "over_18": false}, "15": {"id": "1cvqyt6", "locked": false, "subreddit": "glitchinthematrix", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "MysticStarbird", "link_flair_text": "Glitch Vid", "time": 1716715618.8110723, "created_utc": 1716132828.0, "url": "https://v.redd.it/6ox18mdu1e1d1", "title": "A glitch in the Matrix", "permalink": "/r/GlitchInTheMatrix/comments/1cvqyt6/a_glitch_in_the_matrix/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 203, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "comment_count": 33, "over_18": false}, "16": {"id": "1d0g9y1", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ufo", "stickied": false, "category": "Aliens", "author": "air-flu", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1716715619.9695308, "created_utc": 1716656077.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1d0g9y1", "title": "\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80", "permalink": "/r/ufo/comments/1d0g9y1/_/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 263, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "comment_count": 93, "over_18": false}, "17": {"id": "1cxyf70", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ufos", "stickied": false, "category": "Aliens", "author": "TommyShelbyPFB", "link_flair_text": "NHI", "time": 1716715621.4081373, "created_utc": 1716378958.0, "url": "https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7198943942657069056", "title": "Rear Admiral Tim Gallaudet corroborates Karl Nell's statement on LinkedIN: \"My colleague, retired Army Colonel Karl Nell said with 100% certainty that the world is being visited by higher level, non-human intelligence (NHI).

They met with partial success by detecting increased levels of infrared radiation. Interestingly, the emission oscillated with a low frequency''    \nAs the Taoist concept of Qi crossed over into the West in recent years, the Western word Bio-electricity was coined to describe it since Chi has a number of properties that seem similar to those of electrical energy.    \nEventually, you can learn how to bring up this wave of euphoric energy feel it over your whole body, flooding your being with its natural ecstasy and master it to the point of controlling its duration.  \nThis energy researched and documented under many names, by different people and cultures, such as Bioelectricity,\u00a0Life force,\u00a0Prana,\u00a0Chi,\u00a0Qi,\u00a0Runner's High,\u00a0Euphoria,\u00a0ASMR,\u00a0Ecstasy,\u00a0Orgone,\u00a0Rapture,\u00a0Tension,\u00a0Aura,\u00a0Mana,\u00a0Vayus,\u00a0Nen,\u00a0Intent,\u00a0Tummo,\u00a0Odic force,\u00a0Kriyas,\u00a0Pit\u012b,\u00a0Frisson,\u00a0Ruah,\u00a0Spiritual Energy, Secret Fire,\u00a0The Tingles,\u00a0on-demand quickening,\u00a0Voluntary Piloerection,\u00a0Aether,\u00a0Chills,\u00a0Spiritual Chills\u00a0and many more to be discovered hopefully with your help.\nHere are\u00a0three written tutorials\u00a0going more in-depth on how to control your energy and to understand where it comes from.    \nP.S.

Bad ones. Almost physical. \nHe was an alcoholic when I was small and that left me deeply traumatized. I thought he would kill us. I thought he would kill everyone. His hulking physique and alcohol were a lethal pairing. He even admitted to hiring someone to kill his ex girlfriend when he was drunk but thank God it fell through. \nSo there's a lot between us. I feel like we had no understanding of each other whatsoever. We lived in different planets, different universes even. Parallel but never truly touching. Never once seeing. \nThis was probably the first proper conversation I've had with him in years. We go weeks without saying a word or even looking up when we enter the room. Nothing. \nBut knowing that I saw him calmed him down from his delirium. He relaxed visibly and was no longer fighting death. He settled down and ate ice cream. But he'd told me something that had shook me to my very core. \nHe said that this ran in the family. His grandmother said she saw heaven. Ironically about a week ago I was crying bittersweet tears because I saw heaven too. Or something like it. I saw the afterlife. It was beautiful and terrifying. I woke up in tears. \nI'd never been happier and I'd never been sadder. A major truth was revealed to me. That on this earth plane we can't experience the love we're capable of. \nThe love I felt transcended everything I felt. Everything I thought love was is just a speck compared to the light I felt. \nI knew I would never feel this again. I would never feel this happy again. I will never feel this love again. And maybe if we remembered we could feel it.... \nSo that hit me hard. My entire life I thought I was the freak in the family. That I was alone. That no one could possibly feel what I felt, especially within my own family. They'd never understand me. \nSo that door was blown wide open for me. It was living under my nose the entire time. The entire time there were two mystics under one house and we were too afraid to see it in one another. \nToo stubborn. Too stuck in old stories. I'm also incredibly sensitive. I feel like my dad is too in some ways. I've never seen him cry. He didn't even cry when his mother died. He says he'll never cry for anyone. And he blows up in anger so easily. So of course he's sensitive like I am. Just in a different way. \nI'm also on the autism spectrum so that adds another layer of alienation and I just know that my dad is autistic too. \nThat day I shoved it all beneath me. My mother was terrified. She was looking to me for answers. \n\"Is he crazy?\" she asked. \n\"No. \" I answered honestly. \nHe wasn't crazy. Because if he was crazy then I was crazy. But I know what I feel is REAL. She kind of brushed it off and called him a schizophrenic. It hurt. \nBut I pushed it down anyway. The next day I woke up terrified. I didn't know why. I just felt so anxious. I tried breathing exercises, everything but the sense of dread was still there. \nI'd seen my father around all my life, miserable, angry and getting sick. If that's what hiding your radiance and gifts does to you then I don't want it. \nI don't want to die when I barely turned 60. I don't want to grey and limp and fall in the bathroom, busting my head open then do nothing about it. It was like he was letting himself die. He wanted to. He said he wanted to. \nI saw a part of me in that. The part that was scared. That felt judged. That hid. That felt like such a weirdo. Watching my dad made me realize that it would slowly kill me like a slow acting venom. \nI was seeing it before my eyes. He didn't have anyone to understand him all these years. And probably in his home life too....And look at what it'd done. \nHe was a big angry man hiding gifts and altered states and possibly even God inside of him. And so was I. \nWe were both hiding. \nI couldn't live like that. \nI went to the bathroom and cried by myself for awhile and no one knew. \nI didn't know what to do with this information and I still don't... But it's there. The story is there. And it's a bittersweet story. \nI don't know what I'm going to do with these gifts.\nI hope I can make us proud.\nOne day.", "media": null, "score": 102, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "comment_count": 26, "over_18": false}, "27": {"id": "1d097h0", "locked": false, "subreddit": "letsnotmeet", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "StrangeExpression546", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1716715628.2300868, "created_utc": 1716633536.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1d097h0/new_roommate_turned_out_to_be_my_other_roommates/", "title": "New roommate turned out to be my other roommate's aunt's stalker, and also he left his piss pants in the middle of our main hallway", "permalink": "/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1d097h0/new_roommate_turned_out_to_be_my_other_roommates/", "selftext": "Hi, I made an account just to post this here. The last 48 hours of my life have been nuts.\nI am a 25 year old nonbinary person renting a four bedroom house. One of my roommates is my boyfriend, and the other is my best friend of 10 years. We will call her Tracy. We've been looking for a new roommate, and because of the way this situation turned out we have determined that I am no longer allowed to be in charge of looking for roommates because I am not judgmental enough and I am known to ignore red flags.\nI will start from the beginning, which is the house showing.\nSo, our new prospective roommate showed up for the house showing and introduced himself. He definitely seemed strange at first, but I wrote it off as him just being eccentric. The main red flag was that at some point, he randomly said something to the effect of, \"And I will not bring meth into your house because I am not on meth, I hate drugs and I see them as a scourge on this entire country.\" I did not ask, so I was immediately weirded out but my boyfriend and the roommate who was moving out also met the guy and they both thought that apart from that, he seemed normal. He didn't look like a stereotypical meth head, his skin was clear and he was kind of chubby. We thought that maybe he thought *I* was a meth head, because I look a little bit scary. I have green hair, a 1G septum and 6 facial piercings. In addition, my roommate who was moving out turned out to be hiding a cat which made the house stink like cat piss, which I have been told is what meth smells like. Also, the town this guy was coming from is known for meth and crack and he seemed to be explicitly trying to get away from that town, so I thought that maybe he was afraid of ending up in a situation where he was living with drug addicts and was trying to suss us out that way. Giving him the benefit of the doubt was my first mistake. Me and Tracy were both wigged out about the entire thing, but we were kind of desperate for a roommate and all the other people responding to my listing either were not great fits or were even sketchier than this guy. So, we let him move in.\nSkip to the move-in date. He brings an old man to help move his stuff. He then proceeds to make the old man move all of his things by himself up the stairs while he sits there, including a refrigerator. By himself.\nNew guy signs the lease. Immediately *after* signing the lease, he informs us that he did not introduce himself using his real name and proceeds to tell us his real name. This man was not transgender so the only reason I can think of as for why he initially gave us a fake name is probably so he could avoid having us run a background check.\nAfter this, I had to go to work. Throughout my shift, Tracy sends me a message that the guy is weird, but her responses are vague and I didn't find out what happened until I got home. Here is what she told me:\nThe new guy goes to the bar after signing the lease and comes back after being kicked out before 9PM. The bar he went to is a biker bar that is notorious for being rowdy. It's hard to get kicked out there. You pretty much have to do something heinous or you have to have been creeping on the women there in order to get kicked. When he comes back, he's drunk off his ass and says \"The men there must have been intimidated by me.\" Sounds to me like he was creeping, then.\nBefore this, I had told the new guy that our landlord is coming up the next day to fix some things in the house. When the new guy came home, Tracy reminded him that our landlord was coming the next day. He became extremely angry to the point that he was flailing his arms and she thought he was going to start breaking things. Tracy was so uncomfortable that she almost went to go wake up my boyfriend in the other room. Eventually, the new guy did calm down however.\nThere is a bean bag next to my couch, and Tracy is sitting on the bean bag with her legs slung over the arm rest of the couch. At first the new guy sat on the couch. He begins to read off poetry that he wrote to her for an entire hour and a half, all of which is literally just streams of consciousness about how he wants all junkies to die. Afterwards he starts telling her how beautiful she is over and over and literally lays his head down between her legs. She's trying to ignore him and he won't stop asking her if she fell asleep. Every time she moves away, he gets closer. Then, he starts inviting her to his room for \"beer.\" Eventually she just gets up and goes to her room at 11PM. This man harassed her for 2 entire hours.\nI thought that was everything but then she tells me that she sent the guy's picture to her mom, who then sent his picture to everyone she knows because she's from the town he was previously living in. It turned out that he'd been stalking Tracy's aunt for an entire year, and that he's banned from the bar she works at because he goes there and threatens to kidnap her. She literally has to be escorted out not only by workers but the *customers* escort her to her car sometimes.\nSo we tell our landlord. Luckily, our lease hadn't been finalized yet so he agreed to kick him out. I call my mom to come over and Tracy calls her brother, for backup, just in case things go south.\nOur landlord shows up and essentially tells him he needs to leave and doesn't let the new guy get a word in. The new guy starts getting agitated and aggressive so we called the cops and several officers showed up, told the guy he had no legal standing as there was no lease, he introduced himself to us with a fake name, and he hadn't even been there for a full 24 hours and that he had to get out.\nThe guy had to beg his sister to pick him up, and she was so unwilling to do it that she didn't agree until he offered to pay her $200. It's a 20 minute ride to where he was going.\nHe left most of his stuff on our porch. When we went into his room it smelled like cigarette smoke and there was an empty pack on the floor, including not one or two but 7 empty Dr. Pepper cans and garbage and crusty socks everywhere.\nThis entire situation had me so stressed out that I didn't even notice that he had also left a pair of pissy shorts in the middle of the house's main hallway and that was also the first thing you see when you walk into the house. They were there for the entire day. When he knew the landlord was coming. They were still sitting there when he left. I picked them up with a glove and put them on the porch for him to retrieve, but who knows if/when he will retrieve his things because he came back earlier, touched his things like he was going to take them, and then just immediately left.\nAll I have to say is that I am so relieved that we caught this before the lease was finalized because this easily could have turned into a situation where me and Tracy were being sexually assaulted or worse.\nThank you for listening to my story.", "media": null, "score": 96, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "comment_count": 14, "over_18": true}, "28": {"id": "1cyhlua", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ghosts", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "dsvengalis", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1716715628.8712318, "created_utc": 1716429670.0, "url": "https://v.redd.it/jer1vbbn232d1", "title": "Basement washing machine opens up all by itself.", "permalink": "/r/Ghosts/comments/1cyhlua/basement_washing_machine_opens_up_all_by_itself/", "selftext": "", "media": {"reddit_video": {"bitrate_kbps": 2400, "fallback_url": "https://v.redd.it/jer1vbbn232d1/DASH_720.mp4?source=fallback", "has_audio": false, "height": 720, "width": 1280, "scrubber_media_url": "https://v.redd.it/jer1vbbn232d1/DASH_96.mp4", "dash_url": "https://v.redd.it/jer1vbbn232d1/DASHPlaylist.mpd?a=1719307628%2CMGZlNjJjYTNjZGYyYzU0ZTUyNThjZWNjMzk3NzhiMzlhYzdkOTg2ODkxODEyYTAzMGUwOWZjYmU5YzVkY2VjMA%3D%3D&v=1&f=sd", "duration": 17, "hls_url": "https://v.redd.it/jer1vbbn232d1/HLSPlaylist.m3u8?a=1719307628%2CYmFmZTA1YjBhNjQ5YmE4MjllOGU0YWJlYWZiNDYwYWRlNzZkNDg5NGQ3ZjViNjk2YTcwNWE2ZDgxYzk2YmQ3OQ%3D%3D&v=1&f=sd", "is_gif": false, "transcoding_status": "completed"}}, "score": 875, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "comment_count": 119, "over_18": false}, "29": {"id": "1czhxwv", "locked": false, "subreddit": "glitchinthematrix", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "untilsleep", "link_flair_text": "Glitch Vid", "time": 1716715629.1283844, "created_utc": 1716548023.0, "url": "https://v.redd.it/86juh4xvrv1d1", "title": "Truck needs an alignment", "permalink": "/r/GlitchInTheMatrix/comments/1czhxwv/truck_needs_an_alignment/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 57, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "comment_count": 11, "over_18": false}, "30": {"id": "1cx3ypv", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ufo", "stickied": false, "category": "Aliens", "author": "Useful_Walk1235", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1716715630.2997, "created_utc": 1716284687.0, "url": "https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/weird-news/experts-admit-theyre-trying-lure-32855511", "title": "Experts trying to 'lure UFOs' to Earth with small 'handheld' nuclear reactors", "permalink": "/r/ufo/comments/1cx3ypv/experts_trying_to_lure_ufos_to_earth_with_small/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 160, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "comment_count": 51, "over_18": false}, "31": {"id": "1cyam5q", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ufos", "stickied": false, "category": "Aliens", "author": "runswithbabies", "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "time": 1716715631.6628852, "created_utc": 1716410171.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1cyam5q", "title": "Air Force CCT posted \u201cwhistleblowing\u201d account - it\u2019s gone but but here it is\u2026", "permalink": "/r/UFOs/comments/1cyam5q/air_force_cct_posted_whistleblowing_account_its/", "selftext": "Submission statement: \nScreenshots of a post made and swiftly removed by someone claiming to be an ex Air Force CCT detailing perdonal experiences potentially relevant to this whole thing", "media": null, "score": 3125, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "comment_count": 969, "over_18": false}, "32": {"id": "1cxa8s6", "locked": false, "subreddit": "aliens", "stickied": false, "category": "Aliens", "author": "arealdisneyprincess", "link_flair_text": "News :illuminati:", "time": 1716715633.2777991, "created_utc": 1716304312.0, "url": "https://www.irishstar.com/news/us-news/huge-ufo-sighting-usaf-sergeant-32857355", "title": "'I saw UFO the size of a supermarket land near military base - beings appeared'", "permalink": "/r/aliens/comments/1cxa8s6/i_saw_ufo_the_size_of_a_supermarket_land_near/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 878, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "comment_count": 203, "over_18": false}, "33": {"id": "1d0evsi", "locked": false, "subreddit": "uap", "stickied": false, "category": "Aliens", "author": "Efficient_Effort_231", "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "time": 1716715633.8861194, "created_utc": 1716652093.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UAP/comments/1d0evsi/spoke_with_ryan_graves/", "title": "Spoke with Ryan Graves", "permalink": "/r/UAP/comments/1d0evsi/spoke_with_ryan_graves/", "selftext": "Spoke briefly in person to Ryan Graves.

He gestured at the waiter a Jamaican guy who had served us, and seemed pretty normal and healthy to me.\nSo, I thought he was just some Walter Mitty type character, but it didn't matter to me as I was off to bed in a minute.\nHe rolls a joint in front of me - and invites me - and the 2 Birmingham guys -  to take some. I think I've only tried one once or twice iny life, so I decline. He's quite persistent so I think, \"oh what the hell what harm can 2 or 3 draws do me?\"\nI take about 3 draws, along with the 2 Birmingham lads who, by this time are all sitting at the same table.\nWithin 60 seconds my brain has gone to mush, and my eyes are spinning like saucers. My last abiding memory in the \"restaurant\" is this guy looking into my eyes, wagging his index finger at me and saying \" That's why they call me the fucking doctor\"\nMy mind's gone to shit. I don't know if I'm - or the other 2 guys are being set up to be robbed or worse and I realise I've only got seconds to act.\n\" I'm just going for a piss \" I manage to utter before staggering out the place, my legs like Bambi on ice and stumbling into my hotel just yards away.\nI lay awake from midnight till 6am hallucinating. I've never taken acid before, but that's what I imagine it would be like.\nI never met the 2 Birmingham guys again, so I don't know what transpired after I left.\nSo, let's not meet again Walter Mitty, and strangely I don't believe you're a real doctor.", "media": null, "score": 81, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "comment_count": 4, "over_18": true}, "41": {"id": "1cz33dg", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ghosts", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Equal_Visit2054", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1716715638.8081515, "created_utc": 1716496793.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/9eqsn5t8m82d1.jpeg", "title": "Figure in window appears and disappears help", "permalink": "/r/Ghosts/comments/1cz33dg/figure_in_window_appears_and_disappears_help/", "selftext": "Hello everyone.

I am now due to an uncomfortable situation again. Bear with me if I ramble on I\u2019m writing this off an edible. \nI have to get some context out of the way. Let me start off by saying that I live in an apt complex by a golf course/country club on the edge of town. Since not many people live in this area it can get pretty quiet at night. The complex is built partially into a small hill at the end of a road with my apartment being on the back corner of the building on the ground floor. So the bottom of the windows in the living room and both bedrooms start literally a few inches above the ground outside. There is also a trail behind my apt building that goes through a small wooded patch. I don\u2019t have much of a view since my living room windows face a good 15/20 foot patch of grass before a tree line separating it from a few houses on the next street over. This story has been ongoing for the last couple of months. Not entirely sure if this is just paranoia or coincidental. \nLast summer a family moved into a house on the next street over a couple houses down from my apt. Ive only seen one middle aged man and a dog so far. I was taking my Shih Tzu Harley outside one day while he was out in his backyard just standing with his arms crossed swaying side to side. Like an NPC character in 2000s video games waiting to be interacted with. The dumpster shed area is in view of his back yard. We made eye contact so I awkwardly waved and then just looked at my phone while Harley did her business. But I could tell from my peripheral vision that he didn\u2019t look away from us. We have the same breed of dog so i just assumed he was probably thinking of letting them meet sometime but I wondered why he didn\u2019t have his dog outside with him. I just went back inside quickly after Harley was done. \nMy younger brother lives in the same complex as I do but on the second floor. He told me that every now and then he\u2019d see that man take his dog out into his backyard but the cross the tree line into the complexes yard. He would circle the building slowly a little too close to the building before going back into his house.\nIn September last year my bf at the time and i split up. The night I told him to leave I went to a friends house to vent. I didn\u2019t want to leave Harley home alone too long so after about an hour or so  I came back to my apt. I knocked out on the couch while I had a black screen rain sound video on YouTube on. I woke up around 2 am to Harley going crazy barking and growling. The other couch is right under the main window in my living room. Harley had climbed up the couch and was barking at the window between the curtains.\nI get up to get her down and be quiet when my stomach dropped when I realized something. The curtains are on the thinner side and I can normally faintly see the streetlights from the next street over through the curtains. I started getting a little nervous realizing that there was a black mass blocking some of the lights above where Harley was standing. I grabbed the remote to shut the tv off while I was getting closer to the window. The tv turns off in the style of retro tvs where the picture closes in on itself. When I turned it off the flash animation on the tv illuminated the room briefly. \nIt was enough that I was able to make out the form of someone dressed in black/dark clothes was crouched down looking into my window. In the flash they probably saw me too because they ran away quickly. I picked up Harley and ran to the kitchen to grab a knife and went to my room locking the door. I texted my ex asking him if he was outside of the window just then. He replied back no and asked what was happening. I didn\u2019t believe him because he\u2019s never awake that late and told him I was about to call the police so to just tell me the truth. \nHe told me that I should call them either way and sent me his live location showing that he was at his friends house over an hour away. I called the police and let them know I had seen someone outside my window. They came and looked around finding nothing obviously. An officer told me they\u2019d keep someone in the area so to just call back if anything else happened.\nOver the next couple of weeks around the same time 2-3am each night, Harley would freak at the window. By the time I\u2019d get to her I couldn\u2019t see anyone outside.  \nFast forward to now May 2024. This last week I went through my storage closet and found some of my exes things. I was out with some friends tonight when he came to pick them up. He ended up texting me to come home so we could talk about something important. I get home and i notice that he has a puzzled look on his face. I asked what couldn\u2019t have been just a text. And He told me that while he was loading his stuff in his truck he took Harley out quick. He was approached by an older lady that lives on the second floor.\nThe dumpster is at the end of the parking lot and if you turn right youll face the side of the building in the general area outside my living room window. There\u2019s a few big trees keeping the area back there pretty dark even during the summer it\u2019s deeply shaded. She said that as she was taking her trash out, she heard a twig snap and looked the direction it came from. She said she saw a man outside my window. Not just walking around, he was up close peering into my living room. One hand up on the window trying to block the light so he could see and his phone in the other hand pointing inside my apt. \nShe yelled out asking him what the fuck he was doing but he just acted like he didn\u2019t hear her and walked away slowly in the opposite direction. She said it would be one thing if he was just walking through the yard and glanced over at my window, but he was full on pressing his face against the glass looking in. \nMy blood ran cold and I got goosebumps. I have since bought a ring camera which is something I should have done a long time ago.

I live alone and having an apartment in Paris is very expensive so mine is very small and there\u2019s just a very small window. Because it\u2019s in the first floor, I\u2019m allowed to have a chair and an ashtray in front of my door, in the street, so I can sit and smoke peacefully. It\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit smoking, and my ashtray is always empty now. But, 6 months ago I\u2019ve started to notice that so many smoked cigarettes were in it. These were not mine. First, I thought it was just random people walking down the street and using my ashtray. But the fact is that there\u2019s just one cigarette brand in the ashtray so maybe, it\u2019s the same person who constantly uses it.\nThis isn\u2019t the weirdest part at all. At this point I wasn\u2019t even concerned. \nI\u2019ve been to hospital for months, leaving my apartment unused. When I came back after a while, the ashtray was cleaned and a second chair was added to the first one. It was like some people had a moment in front of my door. This second chair wasn\u2019t mine at all.\nA second time, I\u2019ve leaved my apartment to go back for 1 months at my parents house. When I came back, it was a real mess. Toilet paper everywhere on the floor, cigarettes too. The chair wasn\u2019t here anymore. I was angry and but too tired to clean this mess so I went into my apartment to sleep. I was in bed, close to 1.00 in the morning, and door bell rings? \nIt was a guy, barely naked, just underwear and he was very angry. He screamed at me and said to give me some of my drug. Except I don\u2019t do drugs at all. He said he can pay me a lot of money for drugs and that he saw me multiple times doing marijuana. But I don\u2019t. He was very disappointed in me. He seemed to thought I would keep the drugs for myself and don\u2019t share. But the truth is that I don\u2019t have drugs. \nHe leaves angrily. I\u2019ve heard him screaming outside the door. He looked out of his mind.\nThe morning after. I\u2019ve seen him near the mailbox and he was nice and normal. He didn\u2019t seem to remember anything about last night. As a girl of twenty years old, this experience was kinda scary. And I feel insecure in my own house.\nI\u2019ll give you some updates and will try to add pictures the next time it happens.
