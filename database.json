We would make smoke bombs, fireworks, etc out of whatever we found, and did tons of stupid other shit. Russia in the late 80s resembled the post apocalyptic wasteland you see in movies in a lot of places, mainly because there was really no law and order, so no one cared. You were able to buy crazy things off the streets (my father was once offered an old rocket launcher). With this, parents often just let their kids fuck around in these places, so we would be doing stupid shit in these abandoned buildings. \nWell one day, we were fucking around, when one of my friends noticed someone lurking nearby. We didn't really care, we were used to seeing weird shit, but after a bit we noticed the person was not really moving, they just stood there. When he noticed we had seen him, the man slowly walked into view. A large, bald man, black coat (a nice one, likely an import, which was expensive at the time) and american sneakers (also very expensive). He didn't really greet us or anything, but must have seen me looking at his shoes, because he just said \"like my shoes? I have more if you want them, come on\". Now few things really unnerved any of us, but this dude definitely did. If you know anything about Russia in that era, this dude looked like someone you did not want to fuck with. The kicker though, once he turned around, my friend noticed he had a gun in his pants. The second he saw that, he just yelled \"GUN\" and booked it, and we all just scattered. I just heard the guy curse loudly, but did not see him again. Now if the story ended here, it would have been just a creepy encounter, but some time later, we were no longer allowed to play in that area. I found out much later that they had found another child beaten to death with a rock in that building shortly after our experience. To be honest, as a kid I never really thought much about this until my parents told me about the death, at which point the dots connected and I realized what we potentially ran away from.", "media": null, "score": 281, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comment_count": 7, "over_18": true}, "13": {"id": "1gozvnv", "locked": false, "subreddit": "truecreepy", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "AtmanDharma", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1731726379.155559, "created_utc": 1731351173.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/76pf6u0wjb0e1.png", "title": "A man missing nearly 30 years was found alive and living just 80 miles away from where he disappeared after he helped solve his own disappearance by telling a social worker he had a flashback and remembered his name.

From what I can see in the pictures, it looks like it may have been following a deer. I do not know how the \u201cBigfoot\u201d tracks would be there due to some kind of mold given there are no other human footprints directly next to the tracks.

She told me she wasnt the best communicator, but i often had dreams in which she would communicate to me what she was thinking and/or feeling. Then, in reality, she would either say verbatim what was communicated in my dream or communicate the essnce of what she said. It was really freaky.\nI often had dreams of us having a conflict before an off period, and had dreams of reconciliation before an on period. It was super confusing. \nA while back, during an on period, I had two dreams. In one dream, she consulted a witch to send a channeled message to me that she thought that I was her soulmate and that she was sorry for pushing me away. A day later i had a dream she sent me a text breaking up with me. Then in reality she sent me the exact text from my dream.\nHurt, I stayed away from her. But then shit started getting freaky as fuck. I would be out in public and the second I get close enough to hear a conversation, someone would say her name. \nI would have dreams in which she transformed into a stray cat, then I would see that cat next to my car before leaving for work in reality. \nShe would sing songs to me in my dreams about how sorry she was, then in reality I\u2019d go somewhere in public, hear the song, and the moment i recognized the song from my dream, id hear her name, or see a reminder of her. \nI spend a lot of my time driving and Id often see license plates with her name on it cut in front of me or almost hit me, which is NOT a common enough name to put on a license plate. \nI went on a date with another woman and when I looked up i saw a license plate w her name on it that said \u201cgo<3 ___\u201d. I had a dream that she was waiting for me to make a move pleading with me. \nId often go on social media and see women with her name posting thirst traps or ootd\u2019s set to songs that communicated some variation of \u201cim sorry i miss you please come back im sorry.\u201d \nWe had plans to go to a music festival. I didn\u2019t buy tickets because i had a dream we were headed for another off season lol. i was at a grocery store and a car parked next to me had the dates of the music festival on its license plate. \nI ran into her in public at a place she knows I go to often (that id often take her to) and she played coy when i asked her what was up. I was like you know i go here and she was like \u201coh really\u2026.\u201d We went our separate ways.\nLmao i know this all sounds like bullshit but im so deadass. I talked to my friend whos family did brujeria to stop their patriarch from drinking and she said it sounded similar to what he experienced. \nIdk what to do. A shaman said I was safe? And that it was safe to let my guard down? but idk I\u2019m salty bc she broke up with me and now is telling me shes my soulmate. And on top of that shes not saying or doing anything in reality to communicate how she feels except stalking my social media profile. \nHer birthdays coming up and ive been debating whether or not i should reach out. Then i went to a grocery store and bought a sweet and the expiration date had her bday. The following morning i saw a car with her name on the license plate on my drive back home. \nIts hard to trust her anymore.

I'll just say upfront in the first paragraph that I WILL NOT BE APPROVING ANY NARRATION REQUESTS. I see them asked in the comments all the time, so I'm guessing DMs are worse, and I just don't think it's right for people to scroll this sub looking to market off of people's trauma.\nNow that I've said my piece, back to the reason I'm here.\nI'm 22F, and work as a private investigator. Let me clarify up front that it is not that exciting of a job. It's actually fairly mundane. Due to my age and six months of limited experience, I don't tackle super complicated cases. Some cases I have guidance. I'm still very much learning things every day.\nThis is my first time traveling for work. I'll also stress that the case I'm working is a bluecollar fraud case. Nothing crazy. Again, pretty mundane.\nWhen I was done doing my thing for the day, I walked across the road to go get something to eat. That took about 45 minutes from the time I sat down to the time that I paid my check.\nI had an unexpected visitor while I was washing my hands in the bathroom. I won't give too many details about who that unexpected visitor was, but I needed to go buy tampons.\nI went back to my motel room, showered, changed, and settled in on my iPad while the TV played in the background. Eventually I fell asleep and woke up around 7. \nWhen I go downstairs, I find three of my tires slashed. I have a dashcam on my car, but I take it off when I'm parked for the night to conserve the memory, which was kind of a dumb mistake.\nI called the police and filed a report, but that was about it. As in that's all they really did. I had to ask the front desk clerk to see the security footage, which I was denied. I did ask the officer that responded if there was anything I could do about that, and he simply said he couldn't force them to show the security footage without a warrant. So so so silly.\nAnyone who knows the goings on at most Motel 6's can probably hypothesize why they refused to show security camera footage to police. \nI called the agency that I work for and asked for assistance, but was told they were in no position to assist. Thanks. That's probably going to be something mentioned in the letter that I wrote when I quit once I get back.\nThat was this morning. I'm still here, having to pay for another night in this place out of pocket.\nI'll have to find a way to get to Wal Mart in the morning and find out about getting three tires for my car so I can drive out of here.\nGuy or gal who slashed my tires, lets not meet. You do your thing and just let me do my thing. Slashing 3/4 tires so I can't claim them in my insurance is low. And I'm honestly not letting go of the idea that they may have followed me. I've seen too much ID to know that it's not safe to assume safety.

But instead of urgency, we\u2019re seeing delays, closed doors, and vague statements.

It feels like we\u2019re stuck in this loop of questions with no real answers.\nIt just doesn\u2019t add up.

Because as you all know, the Aliens seem to love the cold North for some odd reason. \ud83d\ude0a\nDonuts for breakfast.\nHallingdal, Norwegian Highlands, May 1957.\nIn this highland mountain region in southern Norway, there have been many UFO sightings over the years. In nearby Torpo, for example, in November 1954, three schoolgirls saw a sphere with a man with red glasses inside staring at them. Also, other fascinating sightings have been made in the same area, as the UFO that was seen and filmed for several hours in 1986. H\u00f8nefoss a bit to the south is a UFO hotspot with many sightings and in Hardangervidda a UFO was seen landing in 1992. Then last but not least we have the famous UFO phenomenon in Hessdalen some miles to the north.\nTypical valley in the province of Hallingdal, Norway. Nesbyen village in picture. (source: Wikipedia)\nThis story took place in May 1957 near the small community of Fl\u00e5 in the valley region of Hallingdal (Halling Dale). A man who was a lumberjack worked temporarily in the area and had rented a small cabin on Turufjell (Turu Mountain), which was on the east side of Hallingdal, between Fl\u00e5 and Gulsvik. The man had woken up early this summer morning at just after 4:00 AM. He opened the door and went outside. It was dawn and fine weather with good visibility. Suddenly he heard a hissing sound, which sounded almost like a bird flying by at close range. He looked around and then caught sight of a silver craft passing by at about 100 meters (110 yards) distance. The shape was round with a hole through it, donut shaped, and it had a diameter of about 15 meters (45 feet). The craft descended slowly towards the ground and hovered.\nAs the man stood there looking at the craft in fascination, he saw a square platform with a grated railing being lowered from the center of the ship. In this were two small, dark-clad \"people\". They jumped off the platform and onto the ground. Then they stood there and \"pointed and glared\" as the man put it. After a short while they jumped aboard the platform again and it was lifted back into the ship and disappeared. Then the craft began to rise again, slowly at first with a noise that sounded like a table fan. After 300 meters, the speed increased very much upwards and it was gone in an instant.\nWhen the lumberjack opened the front door of his cabin that morning he saw something strange. (artistic impression)\nThis event came to light through a letter to a UFO researcher. A man known to the woodcutter had sent it. The story had been told to him. And the friend meant that the lumberjack was a serious person, who didn't go around making things up or lying about things. Woodworkers of this vintage were not like that. He was also anonymous and had nothing to gain by fabricating stories about \"Martians and flying saucers\". Yes, again a sighting from only one witness, where Humanoids are seen getting out of a craft, looking around a bit, and then jumping back in and speeding off. We have seen this type of report from all corners of the earth and it is difficult to understand what the purpose is.\nSource: UFO \u2013 Temahefte 2 - Norske n\u00e6rkontakter av 3. Grad\nAmbushed on a desolate road.\nV\u00e4ggar\u00f6, Sweden, October 29 1965.\nI am usually not very fond of contactee-cases, because I find them rather far fetched and a bit ego-centric. The idea that a random person here on Earth has been contacted by an alien race and got a mission to save humanity or the planet and other strange things we have read about in those cases, I find a little hard to swallow sometimes. But this story is quite intresting though and it involves the famous Trance-Medium couple Sture and Turid Johansson from Stockholm. During the 1970s they even became very famous abroad in parapsychological circles and had Hollywood celebrities such as Shirley MacLaine and Dennis Weaver visiting their home in Sweden during the 70s.\nSture and Turid Johansson. (source: H\u00e5kan Blomqvist's blog)\nSture met Norwegian Turid from Kirkenes in the late 50s. Turid moved to Stockholm in Sweden and they married 1959. Both were very interested in meditation and spirituality and both Sture and Turid considered themselves to have Clairvoyant abilities. During 1964, the couple also became interested in Ufology and joined the Ufological Society in Stockholm. A short time after a meeting at the society, Turid spoke on the phone with a friend. Suddenly they both heard a male voice say on the phone that Turid and Sture were going to a place called V\u00e4ggar\u00f6 on Thursday evening (a small community located in the countryside south of Stockholm). Then the voice disappeared as quickly as it had come. Sture and Turid went out to the place on Thursday as the voice said and then they often went there in the evenings to sit in the car and meditate. Sometimes when they were sitting there, they could perceive blue-purple waves or radiations flowing through the car.\nThe trips to the place in the V\u00e4ggar\u00f6 countryside continued, but after a while mysterious things started to happen every time Turid and Sture went there. During the winter of 1964, so many mishaps happened that they began to wonder if someone was trying to stop them from going there. The most common was that the car broke down in strange ways. So once they even went to the meditation place on V\u00e4ggar\u00f6 on foot. It was many kilometers they had to walk (many miles). This evening it also snowed. As they walked and plodded along the snow-covered forest roads, suddenly an intense blue-white light came behind them, almost like a welding flame, and they jumped into the ditch and the light passed quickly past them on the road above and then shot vertically into the sky like a \"rocket \". If Sture and Turid had not jumped out of the way, the beam of light would have run over them.\nInvestigation at the place on V\u00e4ggar\u00f6 where the couple went to on their meditation trips. (source: H\u00e5kan Blomqvist's blog)\nOn the evening of October 29, 1965, scores of UFO sightings were reported in Sweden. Thousands of people across the country had seen a bright shining object pass across the sky between the hours of 6:00 \u2013 7:00 PM. Many years later, the renowned Swedish UFO researcher Clas Svahn investigated these sightings and concluded that they were due to the American spy satellite 1965-79A that crashed and produced this spectacular light phenomenon high up in the sky. But the satellite theory does not explain everything that happened this autumn evening. Over the Stockholm area and south down towards V\u00e4ggar\u00f6, many had observed a long, dark, cigar-shaped object with many windows (people likened it to a railway carriage with lighted windows) gliding silently over the landscape at low altitude. And in Enk\u00f6ping, young people had seen some small, strange creatures running across the road at around 11:00 PM. The radio station in Enk\u00f6ping also stopped working this evening. Strange things were also reported in Denmark. In S\u00f8nderborg at 8:15 PM, the air raid sirens started to wail at the same time as the electricity went down to low power and disappeared almost completely around the city. And the Danish Air Force received UFO reports throughout the evening. Whether it was due to the crashing satellite or something else was unclear.\nThe cigar shaped craft seen the night of October 29, 1965 looked similar to the craft seen over H\u00e4llefors 1981. (source: AFU & Dan Sternoczky)\nIn Stockholm, the Ufological Society had gathered in a large apartment in the fine central district of \u00d6stermalm. This time the meeting was led by the well-known contact person Sten Lindgren, who had previously received a telepathic message from an acquaintance, another contact person, the American \"Major\" Wayne S. Aho (who was also visiting the apartment in Stockholm at this time) saying that \"spacemen\" led by the alien Val Thor would fly in space over Scandinavia with a mothership and many smaller associated craft this evening. At around 8:00 PM, Wayne Aho received a mental message from Val Thor that \"They are here!\". Many members of the Ufologiska S\u00e4llskapet then went out on the balcony and saw, according to themselves, a group of six orange-glowing Adamski-like craft flying across the sky above Stockholm. According to Sten Lindgren, they were flying at low altitude and they were about 400 \u2013 500 meters (437 \u2013 546 Yards) away at the closest and were flying around in circles.\u00a0 If it was really Val Thor himself who flew in his flying saucer over the city's rooftops that night or if he was just flying around in the Ufological Society's imagination, we will probably never find out.\nThe people gathered on the balcony of the Ufological Society's apartment, claimed they saw 6 glowing craft over Stockholm the same night. (artistic impression)\nDuring the day on October 29, Turid Johansson had received a telepathic message that she and Sture would go to the meditation place on V\u00e4ggar\u00f6 at 10:30 that evening. The \"voice\" also told them to be careful because \u201cthere is a power struggle going on here on earth\".\nWhen they arrived at the scene they were too early and it was only 9:30 PM. They could not understand why it was like that. When they had stopped the car in the usual place, they suddenly saw some shapes in the twilight light down by the meadow. And they came quickly closer, until they were right beside the car. Sture estimated that there were five to six creatures and some of them were only less than a meter (3 feet) away from him. And they were about 1.2 \u2013 1.5 meters (4 \u2013 5 feet) tall, dark green with very large heads and large eyes without pupils and glowing red like phosphorus. They had no ears, nor did he see any feet, but instead they sort of floated across the ground in straight lines, no soft curves. Both Sture and Turid got the feeling that these creatures were evil. While the creatures were around the car, the transistor radio that was in the back seat went down and just crackled all the time.\nReconstruction of the scary event that night in October 1965 (Photo and sketch by H\u00e5kan Blomqvist)\nSture and Turid were now terrified and they wished another car would pass by on the narrow gravel road, but none came. As quickly as they appeared, the creatures now disappeared back down towards the meadow. And then all hell broke loose! A crash was heard and it was as if a flying saucer landed on the roof of the car, which began to shake. The radio screeched and jumped around in the back seat, and Sture and Turid tried to hide under the dashboard. They thought the car would break off in the middle. Then everything suddenly stopped and it was calm again. Both of them were completely shocked and did not dare to do anything. After a while, they had the courage to drive away. Sture and Turid estimated the entire sequence of events to last 5 minutes. Despite this, they did not get home until 4:00 in the morning. Where had all the hours gone? They didn't know that. And later they were offered to find out more about the lost time under hypnosis, but declined because they were afraid of what might be discovered then. The day after the incident, Sture and Turid went back to the scene during the day, but they never found any traces of the night's assault. In the evenings after dark, they never again dared to go back to the meditation place on V\u00e4ggar\u00f6. Because they both felt there was evil there now, that turned the nice place they associated with peace and joy into something horrible.\nSketch made by the witness Sture Johansson. Showing the featureless creatures with big glowing red eyes and dark green skin.\nOver the years, many strange and supernatural events would befall Turid, ranging from strange people she met who knew a lot of things about her that no one should know or people she saw in dreams and then saw them in reality, people she met who she could communicate with telepathically with or others telling things that would happen in the future and then it occured, strange voices on the phone and strange footsteps in her residence and other things. But nothing of a UFO nature happened to Turid until January 22, 1974.\nTurid and her sister were on their way home in the car from a lecture. It was 8:30 PM and they were on Liding\u00f6 just outside Stockholm. Driving past a golf course in a secluded area, they suddenly saw a light out on one of the courses. Since it was January, no one was out golfing at this time of year, especially not so late at night in the dark. Soon after they saw the light again and the outlines of some strange people between the trees and these \"people\" were very long and narrow. Turid's sister wanted to stay and watch, but Turid felt uneasy and thought something was not right, so they continued to go. When they had traveled a couple of hundred meters (200 -250 Yards), they saw a shining object pass by the road at low altitude. When Turid came home, she told Sture what they had been through, and he then told her that he too had seen a glowing orb outside the window that evening. Therefore, they went back to the golf course on Liding\u00f6 already that evening. But they saw no sign of the creatures or the shining object. When they got back home and went to sleep, they heard footsteps and what sounded like a buzzing bumblebee outside the house. Turid's sister also experienced similar phenomena outside her home. In the middle of the night Turid and Sture woke up to footsteps outside and several knocks on the front door, but they could see through a window that no one was there.\nWhen they were driving past the golf course that winter evening, they observed a bright light and many tall and thin beings. (artistic impression)\nWhat Turid and Sture Johansson experienced was very strange and if they were telling the truth it will be even stranger. Because after all, there were some things in this fascinating story that sounded rather absurd and far-fetched. But still there were some similarities with other UFO stories. Small floating creatures with large eyes have been observed in other reports such as the Hopkinsville Goblins case in the USA in 1955. And in France in 1976, a woman driving from Matton to L\u00b4Etang du Banel late at night, reported seeing a lot of small green creatures with big glowing red eyes in a field next to the road. Are the same creatures appearing in these three stories? Maybe, maybe not? Perhaps it is just coincidence? We also see some similarities with other contact case stories. Either they actually experienced this, or there are similarities due to simply reading other stories and imitating them. But we will never know the truth, because neither Turid nor Sture Johansson are with us anymore. Turid passed away already in 2010 and Sture several years later in 2021.\n1. the Hopkinsville Goblin (source: Completely kentucky fandom dot com) \\/ 2.

Several green creatures with red, glowing eyes surrounded the couple's car.\nWinged humanoids on the road.\nLauhala village, western Finland, December 14 1972.\nDuring the first years of the 1970:s, many strange humanoid sightings were made in Finland, such as the goblin-like creature in Imj\u00e4rvi, the Kinnula Ufonaut, the Little Man in northern Finland and Sweden, the boy who saw humanoids on the roof of his house and then got abducted by a claw equipped saucer, the mysterious driver of the \"black car\" in Turku, the musician Pauli Niiran's nightly meeting with humanoids, the snow plow man and the being in the UFO and other fascinating cases. This is another Finnish report on aliens from this time.\nIt was 2:30 AM on this December night in 1972 and farmer Veikko Kivioja was returning home in his car after visiting a neighbor, Seppo Oja, who lived a few kilometers away. After he had driven one and a half kilometers (approx. 1 mile) on winding and snowy forest roads, he rounded another curve and in front of him suddenly he saw three points of light on the left side of the road. He thought it was another car coming towards him on the narrow road and slowed down and then stopped the car and was now a little closer. Veikko now saw that the three lights were actually three human-like beings and there was a strange shimmer of light coming from them. The three humanoids were heading across the road in front of him towards a logging clearing on the right side of the road. The creatures had round heads, but Veikko could not see any facial features. He also saw that they had wing-like arms, which rested against their hips when they walked. The legs were clearly visible and they seemed to walk softly and easily.\nIn front of the surprised man three small humanoids were crossing the forest road. (artistic impression)\nVeikko Kivioja now decided to go back to his neighbor Seppo Oja, to bring another witness with him. He drove his car forward a little in order to turn it around and as he did so the headlights turned on the creatures. He noticed that they were completely ignoring him, as if they didn't see him at all. He drove quickly along the winding road and when he reached the neighbor's house again, he honked like a madman to get the attention of Seppo, who came out and wondered what had happened. Veikko told him and the neighbor followed, even though he didn't believe him and thought it sounded quite ridiculous. But when they got back to the clearing next to the road, Seppo realized it wasn't made up. The creatures were still there, and now they were heading for a small hill about 100 meters (110 yards) away. The two men could also see a glowing sphere that completely enveloped the creatures, and it moved at the same speed as the creatures went. The light from the sphere was so strong that it completely brighten up the surrounding forest and the trees were clearly visible. After 10 minutes the light faded away and the forest became dark again. The creatures were also gone. A short time afterwards, the two men dared to get out of the car and they walked over to the hill to see if they could see any traces of the creatures. But unfortunately they couldn't find anything.\nThe farmer barely escaped the green orb that were passing behind him to the other side of the road. (artistic impression)\nAbout 4 - 5 hours after the two men\u00b4s encounter, dairy farmer Heimo Mattila was out driving his tractor on another road about 10 km (6.2 miles) away. It was still quite dark outside. Suddenly he saw a very bright light coming from the right side of the road about 100 meters (110 yards) away. It turned out to be a spherical object about 2 meters (6 feet) in diameter, emitting a bright green light. The light orb flew towards the road about 1 - 2 meters (3 - 6 feet) above the ground, at the same speed as a human walking, and it gracefully avoided all obstacles in the terrain in front of it. Heimo gassed his tractor and drove forward as fast as he could and the object crossed the road right behind him. As he drove, he could see the green orb of light behind him in the rear view mirror.\nThe question you ask yourself after reading the story of Heikko and Seppo and their encounter with the humanoids... Since they had spent the evening together... were both men really sober? ...Or did they look too deep into the Vodka bottle this evening? Yes, it's not entirely unbelievable. But they may also have seen something really strange. Who knows? And the farmer Heimo also saw something unusual that morning, which somewhat confirms their story.\nSource: Heikki Virtanen\nThe rocking man.\nD\u00f6viken, middle of Sweden, November 24 1988.\nThe whole of 1988 had a big UFO wave in Sweden and in one of these cases a strange being was sighted. On November 24, Rune Asplund from D\u00f6viken in the province of J\u00e4mtland, was drinking coffee at his kitchen table. It was shortly past 9:00 PM. He was looking out of his window when he suddenly caught sight of a humanoid creature in the yard outside, about six meters (18 feet) from the house. The being was around 1,3 meters tall (approx 4 feet), and it stood straddle-legged with arms stretched out from the body. He had something that looked like a frogman's suit covering the head, face and feet. The suit was of a reflective aluminum like material. The creature stood in the same place in the yard, rocking its body from side to side. The witness Rune Asplund watched it for about one minute, and then he decided to go outside, but when he opened the door the creature disappered into nothing. His three dogs were barking like they do when a stranger arrives during the whole encounter.\nA strange humanoid was standing in the yard and rocking its body from side to side. Then it suddenly disappeared into thin air. (source AFU newsletter)\nIn the winter of 1987 Asplund's neighbour saw in the same area, a small man about 1 meter tall (3 feet) disappear into nothing, the same way the being in Rune\u2019s yard did. Mr Asplund also heard that a police car stopped inexplicably as an unidentified object passed by on the same evening. This allegedly happened at Hunge, about 10 km (6 miles) from D\u00f6viken, but this has not been confirmed.\nSource: AFU newsletter no 34 1989\nAlien spy probes.\nGersh\u00f8j, Zealand in Denmark, March 6 2000.\nThis event took place in a small village next to the Roskilde Fjord, and this is a coast where a lot of people spend the summer in the many vacation cabins here. It was in spring and the season had not yet started. A man was out working in his garden, getting it ready for the coming summer. When he looked up, he suddenly saw a beam of \"black\" light, which focused on a grassy area in a nearby field. He was puzzled and could not see where the beam was coming from, so he moved closer. When he was about 80 meters (87 yards) away, he smelled something burning. The man looked up towards where the black beam of light began and could then see a white light there. He looked down at the ground again and then saw several objects moving around in the field and they seemed to be searching for something on the ground.\nSmall metallic spheres with claws hovered low over the field. (artistic impression)\nThe objects were round like spheres and they appeared to be robots of some kind as they had two small, short arms with clawed hands. They were made of polished metal and the man estimated the size to be roughly like soccer balls or basketballs. They had no legs to walk with, but instead seemed to float just above the grass. Not much else happened except for the smell of burnt grass and the robots floating around the area for a while looking and searching for whatever they searched for, and after about 4 minutes they were done with whatever they were doing. Then they moved closer to the black beam and then the robots and the light were gone. And up in the air the white light faded away and was replaced by a blue light, and after 1 minute the bluish light accelerated upward at high speed and disappeared up into the sky.\nStrange story involving what appear to be probes or drones, and sightings of Alien robots are always interesting. This is not a humanoid case, but it is still a fascinating close encounter, which I would like to tell you about. Unfortunately, this story did not seem to have been investigated by UFO researchers, so no one knows if there was any patch of burnt grass or other traces after the event. No one else seemed to have noticed the event either.\nSource: NUFORC", "media": null, "score": 26, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comment_count": 15, "over_18": false}, "41": {"id": "1goxgwy", "locked": false, "subreddit": "cryptids", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "rollingdesigns", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1731726398.6148098, "created_utc": 1731345434.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/l75adppr2b0e1.jpeg", "title": "Spotted in the garden!\ud83d\udc40 A ceramic bigfoot plant friend  I made!\ud83d\ude0a\ud83c\udf3f", "permalink": "/r/cryptids/comments/1goxgwy/spotted_in_the_garden_a_ceramic_bigfoot_plant/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 317, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comment_count": 10, "over_18": false}, "42": {"id": "1gnthhk", "locked": false, "subreddit": "thetruthishere", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "favoritesoups", "link_flair_text": "Discussion/Advice", "time": 1731726398.8709693, "created_utc": 1731216196.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1gnthhk/theater_ghost/", "title": "theater ghost?", "permalink": "/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1gnthhk/theater_ghost/", "selftext": "I\u2019m not very knowledgeable on the paranormal, but i had a very weird experience tonight.

So anyways im in this theater cleaning and i get to the third row away from the top and im facing away from the exit and i start hearing footsteps, i was a little confused bc i didn\u2019t hear the trash trolley, her keys, or her voice calling out she was coming in there. so i turn around and scan the room and as i looked up towards the top of the theatre i see a woman around my height running from the start to the end of the row and i freak the hell out because once she reaches the end it\u2019s like boom she\u2019s gone. it was all kind of a blur, the woman i saw almost had like a blur filter on her. i don\u2019t know if i was just getting tired from working late or what. there\u2019s some rumors that our theater is haunted but idk if it\u2019s true or not, also i\u2019m not the best storyteller so i hope this came out right and doesn\u2019t sound too wack lmao. i figured someone in here would know what was up ", "media": null, "score": 14, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "comment_count": 6, "over_18": false}, "43": {"id": "1gquxm2", "locked": false, "subreddit": "letsnotmeet", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Heyplaguedoctor", "link_flair_text": "NO NARRATIONS", "time": 1731726399.0296638, "created_utc": 1731552468.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1gquxm2/the_midnight_rock_walker/", "title": "The Midnight Rock Walker", "permalink": "/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1gquxm2/the_midnight_rock_walker/", "selftext": "EDIT: NO, you absolutely cannot narrate my story. It\u2019s distasteful to try to profit off of someone else\u2019s trauma. Sarcastic thanks to u/scaryunclejosh for prompting this edit.\nI broke up with my ex boyfriend a year and two months ago (i remember because it was right after my grandma died\u2026 the day before my birthday. Rough time for sure). There were plenty of reasons why, but the final straw was him triggering my PTSD \u201cas a joke,\u201d then asking me to go over to his house and perform sexual favors for him two days later. I have rose-colored glasses permanently affixed to my face, so when The Ex showed me a hole he punched in his bedroom door because he thought his dog was gonna die, the logical part of me said \u201cthis man never learned how to cope with sadness or loss; he just converts it into rage because he has more experience with that.\u201d The romantic part of me said \u201caw, he loves his dog so much!\u201d Guess which one I listened to. \nNonetheless, I dated him for 3 months, during which he attempted to bribe me to stop spending time with my friends, accused me of finding someone else because I had a job, and got jealous when I told him I had to stay home and do laundry. Super normal stuff, right? \nDespite my extreme na\u00efvet\u00e9 and the fact that he lived less than 1/3 mile (or a 2-minute skateboard ride, his main means of transportation) away from me, i knew it would be better to break up through text. After I did, he started spamming me: texting, calling, FaceTiming at all hours of the day and night. When I blocked him, he tried FaceTiming me with his email address (which I didn\u2019t even know could be done) and used over three dozen burner numbers to continue harassing me, including sending screenshots of him accusing me of \u201ctrying to get him killed\u201d on twitter, where his profile picture was a selfie of him wearing a custom spider-man mask that I had crocheted for him and my bra. \nI kept thinking he\u2019d give up, but this lasted until Valentines Day, when I finally changed my phone number. \nAround that time, I started hearing footsteps in the rocks outside my bedroom window in the middle of the night (between 12 and 4 am). Again, I\u2019m dangerously naive, and assumed it was my neighbor taking the trash out, or her daughter sneaking out, or that I was just hallucinating because of the stress. (My curtains were closed and pinned to the wall, so it\u2019s not like I needed to worry about peeping Tom\u2019s, right?)\nI spoke with my neighbor, she confirmed she wasn\u2019t taking the trash out in the middle of the night. I spoke with her daughter, she wasn\u2019t sneaking out. I asked my sister, she heard the footsteps too. Well, fuck. \nI set up some motion activated lights (conveniently at his eye level), within two days, I saw the lights get triggered and heard a very familiar voice say \u201cshit!\u201d but that wasn\u2019t enough to deter him, he still lurked for at least half an hour before I heard the footsteps walking away. \nIn April, the dinky little pet camera I ordered finally arrived. I set it up in my window, it didn\u2019t get great videos, but I hoped it would do the trick. On 4/20, at 12:48am, I got a video of someone covering the camera, the sound of something unzipping, and the camera was uncovered shortly afterwards but didn\u2019t get any clear images (despite my frankly obsessive attempts to clear them up in photo/video editing software). \nHe hasn\u2019t come by since then, but I still live in fear.\nNote: before anyone says to call the police, I tried to get them involved repeatedly, they just victim blamed me.

Today I\u2019m going to post another strange thing that I witnessed in my life that took place in northern Virginia.\nDuring this time I would say I was maybe 11 or 12 and was living in a neighborhood of apartment complexes. I would always go outside and play with other kids around the entire neighborhood. I was out playing with other kids just like any other day and was one of the few kids that stayed out once the sun started to set. The few kids and I went to this one tunnel towards the back part of the neighborhood that connected to a wooded area. We thought this tunnel was a good place to play some soccer and started kicking a ball around. As the sun continued to set and the sky grew darker, most of the kids left. The only kids who remained were me and this one other kid who was a couple years younger than me. We sat down near the end of the tunnel that connected to the woods and started to talk. \nAs we were talking, we both heard some weird whispering sound coming from the edge of the woods. I asked him if he heard that and he said yes. It was dark in that area, but the light from the tunnel made it somewhat visible. I looked towards the woods but didn\u2019t see anything at first, but when I looked to a higher elevation, I saw something. Barely lit by the faint light of the tunnel, I saw a hooded figure that appeared to be floating under a tree branch facing our direction. The hood covered its face and the arms were at the side, so they weren\u2019t holding onto the tree branch. The kid next to me saw it too and got up and ran back into the tunnel towards the neighborhood while crying. I quickly followed him back into the neighborhood and we ran into his older brother, who was also older than me. We told him about it but he didn\u2019t believe us and took his little brother back home. I ran back home after that, as my apartment complex was a little bit further and I did not want to be alone out there at night. \nFrom the brief period I had of observing that figure, I can only describe it as a person with a hood over their face. I only saw the top part of their body and it looked like somebody wearing a hoodie. The inside of the hood was completely black, so I couldn\u2019t make out any facial features. I couldn\u2019t really tell what color the hoodie was, but it had to be some sort of light color for it to stand out like that in the darkness. I didn\u2019t get a chance to look at the lower body of this figure because I was scared and ran away. The tree branch that it was directly under was far too high up so I knew for a fact it wasn\u2019t standing on the ground, which is why I get the idea that it was floating. I couldn\u2019t make out any words from the whispering, but it was pretty loud and noticeable.\nThat\u2019s pretty much it for this encounter. If anyone has any questions regarding this encounter, then please ask. I would also like to know if anyone has heard about similar things like this that has happened to other people.", "media": null, "score": 15, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "comment_count": 1, "over_18": false}, "56": {"id": "1grryt9", "locked": false, "subreddit": "letsnotmeet", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "winelizabethadore", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1731726409.6374955, "created_utc": 1731659763.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1grryt9/banana_peel_clock/", "title": "Banana Peel + Clock ", "permalink": "/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1grryt9/banana_peel_clock/", "selftext": "I posted this in a different sub, but I can't get it out of my mind. The more I consider it, the more certain I am that someone, most likely my creepy maintenance guy, entered my apartment in a very unconventional way.\nThis happened  close to ten years ago. Daylight savings time reminder me of a very strange incident.\nMy husband, baby daughter, and I lived together in a small apartment. We had a clock on the wall in our living room that we never adjusted for daylight savings time. It had been an hour off for months. It was out of reach, and we were really busy.  Rather than changing it, we just joked about it all the time. We rarely relied on the analog clock anyway. Plus, eventually it would be correct again!\nOne day, I got home from a morning outing with my daughter, and I noticed that a banana peel was in the hall on the floor. It had been stepped on. This was very strange because we did not have any bananas in our house. In fact, we never did. None of us ever ate them. I was quite startled. \nI sent a text to my husband, and asked him if he stopped by home during his shift and possibly dropped a banana peel on the floor. He said he most certainly had not. We checked our camera footage, and no one had come into our apartment. I cleaned the banana up off the carpet. \nI packed a diaper bag for my daughter, so we could leave for the afternoon. Before we walked out the door, I glanced at our clock. The time was correct. It had been adjusted for the time change. I was startled. I checked my phone to be certain.  Sure enough, the clock had been adjusted. I grabbed my daughter and our bag, and we left. Once we got safely to the car, I messaged my husband to ask if he had adjusted the clock. He had not. \nWhen we got home that evening, my husband thought I had been joking with him. I still can't explain what happened. My husband is not a practical joker, and this would be a very weird practical joke to play.\nWe felt pretty certain no one had entered our front door. We had a camera. They weren't as good as the ones they make these days, but it worked. The only other way someone could have come into our apartment is through our attic, which was connected to the apartment next door. There were little attic doors in the largest bedroom ceilings. \nI used to tell myself this was some sort of other-worldly or paranormal activity, but the less naive I get, the more I believe our maintenance guy must have entered our apartment through the attic. I assume it must have been the Maintenance guy because he had access to keys, ladders, and such things.  He also gave me very bad vibes. He always made me feel very uneasy. His stares lingered, and he was always hanging around making uncomfortable conversation.\nThe thing that makes me most uncomfortable is that whomever it was left obvious clues that he had been there. If he had been trying to be stealthy, he surely wouldn't have smashed a banana into the carpet and changed the clock. I wonder what he was doing in our apartment. Just hanging around? How often did he do this? Why was he comfortable enough to leave obvious clues that he had been there?\nHe was fired after just a few months on the job.   I was relieved at the time. Looking back, thinking about things now, I'm more than relieved.
