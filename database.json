She was raised in a multigenerational home and was particularly close to her older sister. Stella was an auntie and loved spending time with her family, often staying at her sister\u2019s apartment nearby. \nIn 1996, Stella was 17 and lived in her family home in Bethel. Her grandmother also lived in the home, located across the street from the police station. She also had friends living in Anchorage and would occasionally travel to visit. \nThe disappearance\nEarly Sunday morning on September 29, 1996, Stella was partying with friends at a residence in Bethel. She had been out with the same friends the evening before and was ready to tell them good night. She left the residence to go home sometime between 3 and 4 a.m. \nStella arrived home and found that the front door of her house was locked. She attempted to wake up her sleeping grandmother inside the house but was unsuccessful. Since the home was across the street from the police station, Stella walked over and requested help from a police officer. \nWhen the office was unable to wake up her grandmother, he offered Stella a ride into town. She accepted and the two got in the officer\u2019s squad car. They proceeded to drive the two-and-a-half-mile distance to her sister\u2019s apartment complex in downtown Bethel. \nStella\u2019s older sister, who is unnamed in all sources, lived in a studio apartment in the Bethel Native Corp. Unit, also known as the BNC apartment complex. \nThe officer dropped Stella off at the BNC apartments at 4:30 a.m. She only planned on staying for a short time until she was sure her grandmother was awake. However, less than an hour later Stella decided to leave her sister\u2019s apartment and walk back home.\nBetween 5 and 6 a.m., Stella left on foot and walked southeast towards her home. Stella\u2019s older sister watched as she walked down the street and faded into the darkness of the morning. This was the last confirmed sighting of Stella.\nThere is little information available regarding the investigation into Stella\u2019s disappearance. Her family searched for any clues but were unable to locate her. She was thought to be in the local Bethel area, or possibly the Anchorage, Alaska area, but has not been sighted in either since disappearing. Aside from considering Stella to be missing under \u201csuspicious circumstances\u201d, there are no statements or records from law enforcement that indicate whether an official search took place. \nIn 2009, an investigator with the Alaska State Troopers\u2019 Cold Case Unit reviewed the case file. In a 2010 interview with SitNews in Ketchikan, AK, the investigator said he believes someone in Bethel knows about the disappearance and urged them to come forward. From what little information is available, it appears as though Stella\u2019s disappearance was always considered involuntary, and she was never mis-classified as a runaway, which was a common occurrence at the time. \nStella\u2019s cousin, Juliet, gave in interview in 2015 featured in the Canadian newspaper, The Whitehouse Star. Juliet described Stella as a \u201cvery kind, very fun person\u201d who was always laughing and loved everybody. Stella\u2019s family offered a $5,000 reward fund for information about her disappearance, though Juliet said her family was trying to raise money to increase the amount. Stella\u2019s sister has never stopped looking for her.\nStella Evon is of Yup\u2019ik Eskimo descent. She stood just under 5 feet tall. She has brown eyes and thick, curly black waist-length. Her ears are double pierced. On the morning she disappeared, Stella was wearing a dark blue hoodie sweatshirt with a Georgetown University logo across the front, along with a brown leather jacket, blue jeans, and black shoes.\nBased on data collected from multiple law enforcement agencies and various databases, in 2021, there were 149 unsolved cases of missing indigenous women and girls in Alaska.

finding her way back to me, but on here, and in this subreddit i dont think she will.\ntrigger warning for grooming and stalking\n\u200b\ntwo or three years ago, i met this girl thru mutual friends. she seemed like, amazing, she was so kind and eager to be friends with me, she'd give me presents, and compliments, so much. too much almost. now in this friendship i was developing with her, she'd talk about kidnapping me and having her to herself. obviously, you tell a traumatized naive 16 year old that she'll think its a joke, which is exactly what i did. after a while she started to get oddly sexual with me (i was in a very committed relationship at that time too.) asking if she could feel me up when we met because she didnt know what boobs felt like, or saying how her truck bed was perfect for sex under the stars in a field. mind you shes a year and 11 months older than me. i eventually moved to be with my friend group, unaware that she also lived here, but went to school with my friends. we were all friends with her, and they all have their sides of what happened that i wont recount, as its their story to tell. \nonce i moved here, she'd try and come see me everyday, even after she turned 18 and i was 16 almost 17. she even bought me three pairs of booty shorts for christmas with the note \"cant wait to see you in these, i picked the perfect colors ;)\". i had been uncomfortable with her advances from the start and had even told her on multiple occasions that i was uncomfortable, but it didnt stop her advances. even trying to manipulatively convince me to leave my partner at the time. once i started to pull away emotionally from her, she chewed me out, threatening to kill herself or shoot up her school if i didnt wanna be friends with her. \nonce new years rolled around, and i couldnt handle the constant at this point harassment i was getting from her, i finally told my friends what was happening with her. they told me i was actively being groomed. the gifts, the compliments, the unwavering obsession with me. it made me sick, so me and my roommate finally decided to cut ties with her, blocking her on everything and having one of my parents tell her she was not welcome near me or the house again. \nshe was PISSED, she started to drive by my house or near my street almost every day after she got out of school, even at one point deciding to do a burnout very loudly at my friends house because she knew i was at their house. she would ask my friends about me and ask if i done ignoring her. once she found out i got told i was groomed by her, everything switched. she hated me, said i ruined her life, lead her on, forced her to smoke weed, she even started saying i sent her nudes and started to sexually flirt with her first, all of those not true in any way. she was telling these and so many other things about me to complete strangers at her school too. she was so mad at me, even on my 17th birthday tweeting that she wished id just die already. all her anger, or anything she had said about me would come back to me obviously, as she was actively talking to or engaging with my friends. \nit had been months since i had heard about her or anything she had said about me, i was finally content but that paranoia i had was still strongly there, and terrified.\ni was going to a concert for one of my favorite bands ever, and i was even happier about it because they were playing in a city near me. i had tweeted about getting tickets, and just how excited i was about it. me and my roommate go to the concert, and we're having an amazing time during the openers, i go out to get a cup of water and out of the corner of my eye i see her. she hated this band, she even bashed me for liking them so much. knowing that i brushed my worry off and went back into the concert venue. once the openers left and the band started played me and my roommate we're having SUCH a good time. then during the third or fourth song i turn around and see her so close it was uncomfortable. my body threw me into a panic attack on instinct, and me and my best friend had to leave the concert immediately. it was horrifying, and im still petrified to go to concerts in my state honestly. \ni havent heard anything about her or her whereabouts since then besides hearing she got admitted into a mental hospital for saying some fucked shit to a friend of hers.\nsorry for such a long story, thank you to anyone to who read, and to that girl, i truly hope we never meet again.

At autopsy it was determined that she had also been sexually assaulted, although her body had been found clothed. Law enforcement did what it could, but in an era before affordable and wildly available DNA testing not much could be done at the time to identify the perpetrator. It seems that her murder didn\u2019t receive the media attention similar crimes attracted; the few reports that were published over the years tended to link Ms. Martin's murder to the BTK case despite there being little similarity between the two.\nIn 2020 evidence that had been collected at the time of the attack was sent to Othram, who developed a DNA profile of the perpetrator and passed it on to the FBI for forensic genealogical research. The suspect whose DNA was found on her remains has now been identified as Paul Hart, whose surviving immediate relatives live in Arkansas. Hart died in 1999 in a traffic accident in Memphis; the Sedgwick County District Attorney said in a statement that were he still alive he would have been charged with her murder.\nI don't see a mention of this case on this subreddit but a poster to /u/kansascoldcases/, /u/crimecakes/, was a friend of Ms. Martin and has put together a series of podcasts on this case. I hope this resolution brings her and all of Ms. Martin's family and friends a measure of peace. \n\nhttps://dnasolves.com/articles/krista-martin-wichita/\nhttps://www.kwch.com/2023/10/02/wichita-police-identify-suspect-34-year-old-homicide-case/", "media": null, "score": 987, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comment_count": 63, "over_18": false}, "30": {"id": "16yqy2t", "locked": false, "subreddit": "morbidreality", "stickied": false, "category": "Crime", "author": "Anaelepse", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1696646142.0480223, "created_utc": 1696337071.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MorbidReality/comments/16yqy2t/in_2003_38_year_old_joyce_vincent_died_in_her/", "title": "In 2003, 38 year old Joyce Vincent died in her London flat watching TV, and her body lay undisturbed until almost 3 years later when city officials came to repossess the apartment due to unpaid rent.", "permalink": "/r/MorbidReality/comments/16yqy2t/in_2003_38_year_old_joyce_vincent_died_in_her/", "selftext": "\u200b\nhttps:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/Joyce_Vincent", "media": null, "score": 2525, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comment_count": 236, "over_18": true}, "31": {"id": "16xypej", "locked": false, "subreddit": "urbanmyths", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "verystrangeshit", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1696646142.411995, "created_utc": 1696258247.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/9d1xu99nysrb1.jpg", "title": "Dicyanin - was a dye made from coal-tar by Walter John Kilner.

I began to have repressed traumatic memories begin surfacing of when I was a child of domestic violence and substance abuse and began questioning my self-worth and ability to be a good enough father for my children. I started experiencing rolling panic attacks and developing crippling anxiety, specifically OCD and agoraphobia. I had an indescribably intense fear of death, mostly centered around hell, even though I was no longer a practicing catholic. Things were spiraling and I was growing worse by the day. \nOne night, as suddenly as anything can be, i went from asleep to awake. However, it wasn\u2019t my body that was awake, but rather my consciousness. I was simply aware. I could not see or feel. I felt no anxiety, fear or happiness, only consciousness. It was as if I simply existed within the ether. Weightlessness. Disembodied. What I did feel in that awareness was a feeling of being completely content. There was nothing but peace. It was a moment of reprieve and solace when I was fighting my hardest. Fear of anything seemed the most absurd thing I could imagine. I eventually came back into my body, so to speak. It was a completely fluid and seamless transition. I was actually terrified briefly, but when I woke it felt like I had experienced something special. \nWhat I believe is I somehow experienced my true spirit or being. The thing that I am, that lives behind my eyes and in my heart, but is routinely silenced by my ego. For whatever reason, my fear of death was diminished greatly as my being feels as natural as anything else. I\u2019m meant to be here. I don\u2019t know my role, I don\u2019t know my purpose, I don\u2019t know God. I do however know that not knowing is ok because at my center I am of the universe and I belong. \nI have never had the sensation again. The closest thing I\u2019ve found to it is what Ram Dass and the others who talk about universal consciousness and interconnectedness.\nHas anyone ever experienced this?

Sidenote: I live in a quiet countryside  where is usually nothing happening. I'm a 18 years old girl who can easily walk around my hometown alone without even being scared because it's really safe here. Basically no crimes. \nSo, as usual, me and my dog went for a walk one evening. It was nice weather outside so I decided to go for a nearby field. I usually let my dog out of her leash there so it was fun for both of us, she's a nice dog and always comes when I call for her. We get to the field and everything is going really really well and nothing seems off, except I have this kind of odd feeling in my gut that I never usually have, the last time I had the same feeling when I was eight years old and we were driving at night with my family. I had the same feeling then and I told it to my parents \"I feel like something is wrong, you should be careful\" I said something like that. They slowed down because I was oddly serious at the moment, a minute after I said it a deer came out of nowhere and we would've crushed if we had gone by the same speed as a minute before. We were all shocked and my mom thanked me, I still remember it like it was yesterday. \nHowever, in the field, ten years later, I get the same gut feeling. \"Whatever\" I think and keep going completely ignoring it. We roll around the fields and a nearby forest until the sunset starts to set. I put my dog back to her leash and decide to leave from one of the tiny paths that go through a small forest (it's the quickest way to my home). It's not a popular way to go but it's quick. As I'm walking along that path I suddenly spot a silhouette in the end of the road just before the forest starts. I think nothing of it at that point and just keep walking but after just a little while I have a strong gut feeling and stare at the silhouette for a while, it's then that I notice that the silhouette is staring at me without moving. I just think that maybe they were waiting for someone, because at first the silhouette looked like a child's. But as I got closer I noticed that it wasn't a child but a grown man who was riding difficulty looking child's bicycle. It was a blue-green boys bicycle, his legs were way too long for it and his whole body looked like he was forcing himself to ride it. It was really unsettling sight. Still, my dumbass didn't want to turn around and have a couple of kilometers waste of time and even though it was creepy looking I still thought \"maybe he's waiting for someone that comes from my way?\". But every step i take he follows me with intense expression. I'm only like a twenty meters away from him when he starts to do a weird 'jumps' on his bike, smiling the ugliest and the most unsettling smile I've ever seen, just staring at me with wide eyes. He kinda looks like he was expecting something and is so excited about it that he needs to jump. He looks like he's in his fifties or something, very long and thin legs and arms, bald and that creepy unsettling smile. That's when my alarm rings went on, I glanced behind me and no one was there, it was just me, a 18 years old small girl with her fluffy (definitely not a guard) dog. I turn around 360' and start to jog where I came from, 'just in case'. I glanced at him and sighed in relief when I noticed he wasn't following me or anything, I thought that maybe he wasn't waiting for me after all and called myself stupid and a scaredy cat. I was so wrong. \nMy adrenaline starts to slow down again as I'm in the middle of the fields and I still see no sign of him following me. I let my dog out of her leash again and she starts to run around. I'm nearly at the end of the field (I only have a kilometer or sum a forest part before I get to my home after the field part) when my dog spots a rabbit or deer or some interesting thing and flies towards it, I panic because she has never done that before and yell for her. I yell plenty of times for her loudly and finally she comes back. I'm relieved that nothing happened to her but but as I put her back to her leash I notice something form the corner of my eye. The freaking bald long legs is biking towards me, he's not looking at the ground when he bikes, but me. Freak out wasn't enough to express my feeling in that moment. I have never seen a human who looks so crazy. More than crazy. what surprised me the most was that he was biking through a field, and I can tell you it is not a easy field to even walk sometimes. It has muddy ponds that you need to jump over but that psycho just biked through them. He was struggling A LOT to bike there but somehow managed to still do that, I didn't watch for another second behind me because I just started running. I ran so freaking full speed (and I have asthma) that I saw black and nearly collapsed, my lungs hurt so bad that I thought I was dying but the adrenaline kept my blood running and my legs too. Once I glanced behind me and he was there, struggling badly to keep up his full speed on the field grounds with that ugly white smile and the way too little bike. After that I just ran like crazy until I found a house, hid in their yard without even minding that I was in someone else's yard. It didn't matter to me in that moment at all. I waited a while with my breathing stuck in my throat, but he didn't come. I was planning to yell as loudly as I could if he found me but he never did. At some point the adrenaline started leaving my system and I left my hiding spot. I ran again until I reached an area which had multiple people in their yards so I would have help if I saw him again. But I didn't. I typed 911 into my phone but couldn't bring myself to call, mostly because I had no proof and I didn't want my parents to find out because they are overprotecting so I wouldn't probably leave my house anymore (I still live with them sidenote). I've been paranoid after this incident, my dog was frightened too. I guess she noticed something was really off too. I swear to god that I will always ALWAYS listen to my gut when it's telling me something from now on. I'm still scared of him, I've expected to randomly spot him in some area and what he could've done to me. I can't forget his awful smile. I feel like he's gonna jump on my window one night and do what he wants to me. I feel paranoid and helpless, I'm still thinking about calling the police.", "media": null, "score": 54, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "comment_count": 17, "over_18": true}, "34": {"id": "16yzcz2", "locked": false, "subreddit": "morbidhistory", "stickied": false, "category": "Crime", "author": "dannydutch1", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1696646143.0285175, "created_utc": 1696357329.0, "url": "https://www.dannydutch.com/post/the-execution-of-dafydd-ap-gruffydd", "title": "On this day in 1283, Dafydd ap Gruffydd, a genuine Prince of Wales, was executed. \ud83c\udff4\udb40\udc67\udb40\udc62\udb40\udc77\udb40\udc6c\udb40\udc73\udb40\udc7f Edward Longshanks (Edward I) decided an example needed to be made of Dafydd and had him hung drawn and quartered.", "permalink": "/r/MorbidHistory/comments/16yzcz2/on_this_day_in_1283_dafydd_ap_gruffydd_a_genuine/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "comment_count": 0, "over_18": false}, "35": {"id": "16x6ey8", "locked": false, "subreddit": "crimescene", "stickied": true, "category": "Crime", "author": "AutoModerator", "link_flair_text": "META", "time": 1696646143.2701528, "created_utc": 1696179630.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CrimeScene/comments/16x6ey8/monthly_discussion_thread_october_2023/", "title": "MONTHLY DISCUSSION THREAD! | October 2023", "permalink": "/r/CrimeScene/comments/16x6ey8/monthly_discussion_thread_october_2023/", "selftext": "Welcome to the weekly discussion thread, come and talk about anything you'd like!\nA new discussion thread is posted on the first day of each month at 1 PM EST.", "media": null, "score": 20, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "comment_count": 15, "over_18": true}, "36": {"id": "170assa", "locked": false, "subreddit": "truecreepy", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "MisterMysteriesYT", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1696646143.5219507, "created_utc": 1696487566.0, "url": "https://youtu.be/TWVpDwe37N4", "title": "What Happened to the Fort Worth Missing Trio?", "permalink": "/r/truecreepy/comments/170assa/what_happened_to_the_fort_worth_missing_trio/", "selftext": "", "media": {"type": "youtube.com", "oembed": {"provider_url": "https://www.youtube.com/", "version": "1.0", "title": "What Happened to the Fort Worth Missing Trio? | Unsolved", "type": "video", "thumbnail_width": 480, "height": 200, "width": 356, "html": "<iframe width=\"356\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TWVpDwe37N4?feature=oembed&enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen title=\"What Happened to the Fort Worth Missing Trio? | Unsolved\"></iframe>", "author_name": "Mister Mysteries", "provider_name": "YouTube", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TWVpDwe37N4/hqdefault.jpg", "thumbnail_height": 360, "author_url": "https://www.youtube.com/@Mister_Mysteries"}}, "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comment_count": 0, "over_18": false}, "37": {"id": "171reth", "locked": false, "subreddit": "threekings", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Assistance_Salty", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1696646143.7086494, "created_utc": 1696635526.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/threekings/comments/171reth/rituals_are_awesome/", "title": "Rituals are awesome", "permalink": "/r/threekings/comments/171reth/rituals_are_awesome/", "selftext": "If I had a kid or if I had access to death sprits, could he or I bring my soul or a loved one back to life in another body?\nAre there rituals that can bring someone back from death?( Friend, Family Member or a pet?", "media": null, "score": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comment_count": 1, "over_18": false}, "38": {"id": "16xquo6", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ghosts", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "JudasPenguin", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1696646144.6608782, "created_utc": 1696234168.0, "url": "https://v.redd.it/ot2w1m12zqrb1", "title": "Checkmate, skeptics.

They were hardly needed, given the creative killing methods devised by the Iraqi army for the occasion.\n\u201cYou wait until nighttime, and you will see how we are killing these Iranian dogs,\u201d an Iraqi officer said with a broad grin. \u201cWe are frying them like eggplants.\u201d\nHe then took us on a tour of dozens of thick electrical cables his troops had lain through the marshy battlefield, a spaghetti network that snaked in and out of the patchwork of lagoons. He showed us the mammoth electric generators that fed the exposed power lines from positions just behind the Iraqi front lines. And, when the Iranian Revolutionary Guards made their regular evening advance, the officer and his men demonstrated the macabre genius of their invention.\nIraqi gun batteries fired just enough artillery to force the Revolutionary Guards from their marsh boats, and, when hundreds of them had been forced to continue their advance through the lagoons on foot, the men manning the Iraqi generators flipped a few switches and sent thousands of volts of electricity surging through the marshland.\nWithin seconds, hundreds of Iranians were electrocuted.\nBut the horror show did not end there. The following morning, Iraqi troops began another grisly routine that the officer called \u201cthe morning road detail.\u201d\nThey made their way through the marshes, gathering up the dead Iranian soldiers like dynamite fishermen harvesting a day\u2019s catch. Working methodically, the Iraqis piled the corpses on top of one another in the water in head-to-toe stacks, five bodies high and five across.\nTogether, the human piles formed long rows, the width of a troop truck, the top layers above the water\u2019s surface. Each row extended in a straight line through the marshes from the Iraqis\u2019 positions toward the Iranian border. Finally, the rows were sprinkled with lime and covered over with a foot-thick tier of desert sand.\nIt was the Iraqi method of road building, using the bodies of their enemies to construct assault routes for tanks and trucks.", "media": null, "score": 2448, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comment_count": 120, "over_18": true}, "51": {"id": "170be00", "locked": false, "subreddit": "urbanmyths", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "YaOIBLFudanshi69", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1696646157.0106995, "created_utc": 1696489806.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UrbanMyths/comments/170be00/haunted_places_in_eastern_north_carolina/", "title": "Haunted Places In Eastern North Carolina", "permalink": "/r/UrbanMyths/comments/170be00/haunted_places_in_eastern_north_carolina/", "selftext": "I'm looking for spooky ghost stories to hunt down and explore this halloween, but i haven't any luck finding any that i can explore freely without a tour guide on an old ship.

Usually after our school ended I used to go to the tuition with my 2 friends. Our tuition class was situated in small jungle area, we would come to the class exactly at 6pm. Actually it was a haunted place bcz of some people had experienced really creepy incidents there even our teacher had said us that it was really dangerous, also she had an unusual experience there. There were just 2 street lights there bcz of it's remoteness, it used to be too dark when we had to get back to home. \nBut we didn't experienced such things there bcz we friends used to have fun there playing, talking and all. \nAnd one day this happens, a junior friend of mine wanted to go to the washroom badly so he went outside the class compound to pee we all usually used to go outside only. So when he was peeing he turns his face to right side, there was a small house which was empty and nobody lives there it's windows were broken we so  can see inside everything, there was no light it was fully dark there. \nWhen he turned his face to the right he saw a figure of an adult kid whose face was too creepy, & only the head and a hand was visible when he was watching there and the figure was calling my friend by gesturing from hand. My friend was shivering and he came running to our teacher and said everything wt had happened with him. \nHe didn't came to the class for 2 days he had fever bcz of that incident. \nAfter that me and my bestie were saying he might have hallucinated. Bcz we were teenagers at that time we didn't cared much abt these things and we both me and my bestie decide to have a tour around that haunted house. A friend of mine had a phone and he said us to record the whole thing. We said okay and went on for it, it was 8pm. \nWe both were recording everything in the house from the outside and making fun of it saying \"hey ghost where are you we are here to see you.\" \nAnd we walked around the house recording everything, it was fully dark and our flashlight was on. Lastly we go back of the house and I felt something went like a flash when I saw the camera, but I ignored it and from back there we could see our remaining friends standing there for us outside the class compound. \nAt the end of the tour when we were calling our friends from back of the house saying them see nothing is here and were also whistling while end of the video recording. Then we came back to the class. Ready to watch the video and we both remember the video was abt 8 to 9 minutes. But when we saw the video the video was ended in just 2 minutes while we were heading towards the back of the house as I said I felt something flashed in the camera, and as the flash came  the video was ended there itself. And also we both before starting the video had assured and checked it twice if the video recording is on or not, so we don't have the doubt abt had we started the video or not. \nTill now we talk abt  that day and still we feel creepy abt it. Now we do feel it was really there..", "media": null, "score": 16, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "comment_count": 1, "over_18": false}, "53": {"id": "16xs6y5", "locked": false, "subreddit": "morbidhistory", "stickied": false, "category": "Crime", "author": "GeneralDavis87", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1696646157.5703447, "created_utc": 1696239266.0, "url": "https://youtu.be/__A3YyHL2Q4?si=WALpNhKpe3chGxAi", "title": "1st Marine Division in Action at Bunker Hill North Korea", "permalink": "/r/MorbidHistory/comments/16xs6y5/1st_marine_division_in_action_at_bunker_hill/", "selftext": "", "media": {"type": "youtube.com", "oembed": {"provider_url": "https://www.youtube.com/", "version": "1.0", "title": "1st Marine Division in Action at Bunker Hill North Korea", "type": "video", "thumbnail_width": 480, "height": 200, "width": 356, "html": "<iframe width=\"356\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/__A3YyHL2Q4?feature=oembed&enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen title=\"1st Marine Division in Action at Bunker Hill North Korea\"></iframe>", "author_name": "The Federal File", "provider_name": "YouTube", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/__A3YyHL2Q4/hqdefault.jpg", "thumbnail_height": 360, "author_url": "https://www.youtube.com/@TheFederalFile"}}, "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "comment_count": 0, "over_18": false}, "54": {"id": "170u5fb", "locked": false, "subreddit": "truecreepy", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Pale_Satisfaction798", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1696646158.0103102, "created_utc": 1696541801.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truecreepy/comments/170u5fb/if_the_government_asked_for_americans_to/", "title": "If the government asked for Americans to volunteer their fingerprints, would you comply or refuse?", "permalink": "/r/truecreepy/comments/170u5fb/if_the_government_asked_for_americans_to/", "selftext": "Maybe even DNA.. the Charlotte Sena case got me thinking, I wonder how beneficial a larger database of fingerprint records could be.

Despite the brutality of the crime, no suspects have ever been named.", "permalink": "/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/16vy86v/sigrid_stevenson_was_murdered_while_playing_piano/", "selftext": "On September 4, 1977, college student Sigrid Stevenson was found dead on the main stage of Kendall Hall, a performance theater on the campus at The College of New Jersey (then called Trenton State College). She was 25 years old. A talented pianist and aspiring music teacher, Sigrid was known for her love of playing the piano and was known to sneak into Kendall Hall for rehearsals.\nSigrid was found naked, wrapped in the piano cover, lying face-down. She had been bludgeoned to death with a blunt object. The damage was so severe, and the scene so bloody, that she could only be identified by her hair.\nIt was four days before classes were supposed to start.\nSigrid In Life: The Free-Spirited Pianist\nSigrid Stevenson was known as a free spirit who favored a bohemian lifestyle and loved being on the move. Originally from California, Sigrid was an accomplished pianist, whose love of playing the instrument was central to her life. She was originally from California, but had previously lived in New Jersey for a few years when her father taught at Princeton University. She was enrolled at Trenton State College in pursuit of a master\u2019s degree in music, with ambitions to one day teach music.\nThose who knew Sigrid praised her independence\u2014beyond what was expected of young women in the 70\u2019s\u2014and creativity. Close friends and family called her \u201cZiggy.\u201d Their firsthand accounts paint a picture of an expressive soul who took pride in her individualism and didn\u2019t feel an obligation to follow the status quo.\nTo those outside her circle, Sigrid was known as someone very comfortable being alone. She was friendly, but reserved; a laid-back wanderer but not a partier. Classmates described her as cautious and reserved, but friendly and kind when she opened up. Everyone knew her as an accomplished musician, and the sounds of her playing piano in the Allen Drawing Room or ABE residence halls were familiar on campus. \nSigrid did have a reputation for staying in university buildings after hours. Her green bike would often be chained up outside\u2014a telltale sign.\nDuring her summer travels, Sigrid carried a sketchbook everywhere. She sold drawings of cityscapes to supplement her tight budget; to fund her education. After speaking with those who knew her, a campus newspaper article eulogized Sigrid as \u201can expressive soul who never let financial constraints impede her love of life.\u201d\nSigrid\u2019s Final Days\nIn the summer months before her death, Sigrid hitchhiked across the United States and Canada before making her way to NJ for the fall semester. There are some conflicting reports about Sigrid\u2019s living situation at the time of her death. Earlier that summer, Sigrid rented a room from Trenton Stage professor Dr. Alan Lutz. She moved out at the beginning of August.\nAt the time of her death, the campus newspaper, The Signal, reported that Sigrid rented a room from another local professor, Dr. Stanley Austin. This is incorrect, and The Signal later issued a correction. In fact, Dr. Austin was the one who identified Sigrid\u2019s body after she was found. He was a supervisor of graduate music study at the college at the time, and would have known her. It\u2019s still important to note this, however, because it\u2019s been frequently misreported that she was living with the Austin family.\nA third report, which feels important to mention though not much is out there about it, claims that Sigrid was dating a volunteer fireman from Ewing Township, NJ and may have been staying, or planned to stay, with him. Besides quick mentions in early articles about the murder, nothing else is publicly known about this fireman. Of note, Sigrid\u2019s friends said in police interviews at the time of her death that they didn\u2019t think she had a boyfriend and didn\u2019t seem interested in dating.\nBecause Sigrid was well-known to hang around campus\u2014and the theatre specifically\u2014after hours, there was also speculation that Sigrid did not have a permanent home at the time and was sleeping in the theatre while waiting for the campus dorms to open in a few days.\nI personally believe this is the most logical conclusion: that Sigrid was between places to live after her vacation ended, and she was waiting out the last few days before the semester officially started. Money was tight for her, and I could see someone who was already comfortable with hitchhiking across the country choosing to take a chance instead of shelling out for rent, more travel, or a hotel.\nSeptember 4, 1977: The Night of the Murder\nIt was September 4th, the Sunday of Labor Day weekend and very few people were on campus. Earlier in the day\u2014or the previous night, based on a few conflicting reports that I don't feel totally comfortable ruling out\u2014Sigrid attended a performance of a play on campus titled, \u201cJ.B.\u201d\nRegardless of when the performance took place, the cast and crew of J.B. were the last ones known to be in the building on the day of Sigrid's death. They departed around noon and locked up behind them. Sigrid remained on campus until she made her way back to Kendall Hall that evening.\nKendall Hall was one of the original buildings on campus, built in 1932 and still used for music and stage productions to this day. It was locked\u2014but not very securely. Sigrid had been known to sneak in at night to play the piano often. She preferred the one on the Kendall Hall stage because it was used less often than the practice pianos available in the music building.\nEvidence suggests that Sigrid was playing the piano in the last moments of her life.\nShortly before midnight, campus police officer Steven Kokotajlo noticed an unattended bicycle chained up outside Kendall Hall while patrolling. The building was locked when he entered to investigate the auditorium.\nSigrid\u2019s body was discovered on stage. She was nude and lying face down, poorly covered with a white canvas dustcover for the nearby piano. Sigrid had been bludgeoned to death with a blunt object. Blood was pooling on stage, and splattered against her sheet music. The damage was so severe, and the scene so bloody, that she could only later be identified by her hair.\nHer jeans were found folded neatly. Some think this could imply she was playing piano in the nude, taking advantage of the freedom afforded by an empty theater in the quietest hours of the night.\nSigrid had not been robbed or sexually assaulted. There was no known motive, no murder weapon, no real evidence\u2014especially since DNA analysis wasn\u2019t what it is today\u2014and no suspects.\nThe Investigation & Response\nWith very little to go on, investigators questioned over 100 people and issued several dozen polygraph tests to students, staff, and at least one member of campus police. A search for a murder weapon took place at the nearby Lake Ceva two weeks after the murder, but nothing turned up. By December, the trail had gone cold enough that investigators sought outside help from psychologists at the University of Pennsylvania, private investigators, and (self-described) \u201cnoted psychic\u201d Sidney Porcelian.\nThis also amounted to zero leads.\nOn campus, the response was\u2026minimal. College officials prepared the 1,100 entering class members by providing them with a piece of paper with safety advice such as, \u201clock your door, even if you will be gone only a few minutes\u201d and \u201clock your door when sleeping or taking a nap.\u201d The stage in Kendall Hall continued to be used for performances throughout the year, including a concert by The Kinks just two months later.\nFall, winter, and spring came and went. At the end of the academic year, the university memorialized Sigrid with a brief recap of her murder in the 1978 yearbook.\nIt was barely more than 100 words. Her name was misspelled.\nToday, the College of New Jersey has no plaques in remembrance of Sigrid Stevenson on campus; no scholarships in her name; no benches, piano or otherwise, are dedicated in her memory. The story of her death became an urban legend on campus, and Sigrid Stevenson was reduced to a ghost story about phantom piano music used to scare freshmen.\nSigrid\u2019s parents both passed away without learning anything else about who murdered their daughter.\nNo suspect has ever been named in her case.\nThe Main Theories\nObviously, the lack of major suspects, DNA evidence, or a murder weapon makes it difficult to form a solid theory on this case. The TCNJ campus is fairly contained and set apart from the surrounding residential areas. Sigrid also died the Sunday night of Labor Day Weekend\u2014so the campus was much more deserted than just regular \u2018end of break\u2019 deserted.\nThere has been some speculation that the campus police officer who discovered the crime scene could have been the perpetrator. This is also what a private investigator and the psychic consultant have implied\u2014but that likely has more to do with a lack of suspects than any credibility on their end.\nThe full cast and crew of the \u201cJ.B.\u201d play were questioned extensively, and none were pursued as suspects.\nIf you have any information about what might have happened to Sigrid Stevenson in 1977, please reach out to the Ewing Township Police Department.\nSources\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20210912040712/https://tcnjsignal.net/2011/10/04/grad-student-killed-in-kendall-in-%e2%80%9977-the-unsolved-story/\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/1977/09/07/archives/trenton-state-students-cautioned-after-murder.html\nhttps://weirdnj.com/stories/garden-state-ghosts/murdered-music-major-haunts-college-of-nj-trenton-state/\nhttps://www.nj.com/mercer/2014/09/unsolved_mystery_37-year-old_tcnj_cold_case_intrigues_filmmaker_who_wants_answers.html\nhttps://www.courierpostonline.com/story/opinion/readers/2016/11/09/letter-students-death-should-remembered-better/93477186/\nhttps://www.courierpostonline.com/story/news/local/new-jersey/weird-nj/2016/10/30/weird-nj-murdered-student-haunt-tcnj/92929174/\n", "media": null, "score": 736, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comment_count": 114, "over_18": false}, "67": {"id": "16wgtc6", "locked": false, "subreddit": "morbidreality", "stickied": false, "category": "Crime", "author": "ReferenceLong2546", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1696646170.5291364, "created_utc": 1696105321.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MorbidReality/comments/16wgtc6/in_2000_4_yearsold_lauren_key_passed_away_after/", "title": "In 2000 4 years-old Lauren Key passed away after fallen from a cliff, in 2015, it is revelead that her own father, Cameron Brown murdered her to avoid child support.", "permalink": "/r/MorbidReality/comments/16wgtc6/in_2000_4_yearsold_lauren_key_passed_away_after/", "selftext": "\u200b\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mctjndhvbgrb1.png?width=290&format=png&auto=webp&s=e439cb1736d910c1375e3a0e90abd56a92c40ad4", "media": null, "score": 2440, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comment_count": 131, "over_18": true}, "68": {"id": "16zw15q", "locked": false, "subreddit": "thetruthishere", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Gkbuck", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1696646171.086596, "created_utc": 1696447247.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/16zw15q/weird_beeping_noises_at_night/", "title": "weird beeping noises at night", "permalink": "/r/Thetruthishere/comments/16zw15q/weird_beeping_noises_at_night/", "selftext": "I live in West Los Angeles and last night i was in bed on my phone when i heard a weird beeping sound.

When she finally did come out of her room a few minutes later I asked if she'd opened her door a few minutes before and she said no and that she'd only just gotten up. That's what really freaked me out. So we asked our neighbors downstairs for their ring footage and they said that the footage was missing from 11:30-12:30, the exact time all of this was happening.\nI'm wondering if anyone might have a suggestion in terms of extra safety tips but also, if the sequence of rings might ring a bell with anyone. I know my description is kinda bad, but it's the best I can do.\nbeep example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhkg5VS1AYc\nerror example: https://youtu.be/0M3PYZ7fCZ4?si=pmWlthuHyTecZdpy&t=4\nwee wee (lol) example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWNFxOk-fyY", "media": null, "score": 14, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "comment_count": 5, "over_18": false}, "69": {"id": "16wdjw5", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ghosts", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "ryes31", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1696646173.1760633, "created_utc": 1696097205.0, "url": "https://v.redd.it/0y0idyosnfrb1", "title": "Saw this after checking the security camera in our kitchen", "permalink": "/r/Ghosts/comments/16wdjw5/saw_this_after_checking_the_security_camera_in/", "selftext": "We were sitting in the living room and heard a noise, like a magnet falling off of the fridge or something.

Deroshia was 26 years old and a single mom to her 7-year-old son, Kamal.\nDeroshia and Kamal lived in a small, 1-\u00bd-story house in the Clifton Hills neighborhood, 10 minutes outside of downtown Omaha.\nWhen Pinkey hadn\u2019t heard from her daughter all day Monday, she and three others decided to go over to Deroshia\u2019s house on Tuesday and check on them.They stopped by Deroshia\u2019s neighbor\u2019s house to borrow her spare key and let themselves in the front door.\nWhat Pinkey and the others discovered was a nightmare. On his bedroom floor was 7-year-old  Kamal, dead, still wearing his pajamas, apparently strangled with a rope around his neck.\nThey left the scene and immediately called police.\nWhen police searched the Matthews home, they also found the deceased body of 26-year-old Deroshia, partially clothed, suffocated and strangled on a water bed in the basement. Just like her son, Deroshia still had a rope around her neck.\nAccording to an article published in The Lincoln Star newspaper the following day, the Matthews home was \u201cransacked\u201d but there \u201cdidn\u2019t appear to be a violent struggle\u201d. Drawers were pulled out and papers were all over the place.\nAccording to Homicide Lieutenant Foster Burchard, the last known contact with Deroshia was her mother Pinkey, who spoke with her on the phone \u201cearly on Monday\u201d but Kamal never made it to school that day and he didn\u2019t do his normal paper route Monday evening.\nIt\u2019s uncertain whether or not the front door to the Matthews home was actually locked when Pinkey arrived Tuesday morning and discovered the crime scene, but the back door was locked and bolted from the inside. \nThe other people that accompanied Pinkey to the crime scene were Deroshia\u2019s cousin (Velma Strong), Velma\u2019s husband J.C.,and a Mrs. Martin, one of Deroshia\u2019s former coworkers and friends.\nAccording to Deroshia\u2019s friend and former coworker, Mrs. Martin, the living room was \u201call torn up\u201d, the front window was \u201cup\u201d, and the tv was still playing.\nDeroshia had been unemployed since February after resigning from her job as a classroom aide and crossing guard for the nearby school.\nKamal\u2019s biological father lived in California and his parents were never married.\nAccording to an article in the Lincoln Journal Star newspaper from January 2004, a man named Louis M. Walker, also known as Abdul Malik Husain, was arrested in connection to the murders, based on a tip placed in 2003. Louis would have been about 21 years old at the time of the murders. But there have been no new updates since Walker\u2019s arrest and the case remains cold.\nIf you have any information regarding Deroshia and Kamal\u2019s case, please contact Omaha Police 402-444-5656\nhttps://police.cityofomaha.org/cold-case-details?cid=37&caseTitle=Deroshia+Matthews+%2F+Kamal+Matthews", "media": null, "score": 664, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comment_count": 79, "over_18": false}, "81": {"id": "170lzzw", "locked": false, "subreddit": "morbidreality", "stickied": false, "category": "Crime", "author": "PlantZenGuy", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1696646184.5353105, "created_utc": 1696522465.0, "url": "https://lawandcrime.com/crime/i-saw-my-children-but-i-didnt-feel-them-father-recounts-horrifying-moments-he-realized-his-entire-family-had-been-killed-by-estranged-wife-in-double-murder-suicide/", "title": "\u2018I saw my children but I didn\u2019t feel them\u2019: Father recounts horrifying moments he realized his entire family had been killed by estranged wife in double murder-suicide.", "permalink": "/r/MorbidReality/comments/170lzzw/i_saw_my_children_but_i_didnt_feel_them_father/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 2283, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comment_count": 174, "over_18": true}, "82": {"id": "16y4qdb", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ghosts", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Nuna11y", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1696646187.285054, "created_utc": 1696272366.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/16y4qdb/modern_phones_nowadays_have_great_cameras_so/", "title": "Modern phones nowadays have great cameras so shouldn't the quality of these supposed ghost videos be of good quality?

It suggests a kind of communication that might be more advanced than what is observed in known non-human primates but not as advanced or structured as human language.\nAnyhow I had fun and hope you did too.", "media": null, "score": 167, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "comment_count": 58, "over_18": false}, "85": {"id": "16ybpna", "locked": false, "subreddit": "cryptozoology", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "justa-human", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1696646189.6191196, "created_utc": 1696288290.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/16ybpna", "title": "How did the canines with mange even be apart of the chupacabra myth?", "permalink": "/r/Cryptozoology/comments/16ybpna/how_did_the_canines_with_mange_even_be_apart_of/", "selftext": "Also where tf did the wings come from?", "media": null, "score": 139, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "comment_count": 48, "over_18": false}, "86": {"id": "170ltd4", "locked": false, "subreddit": "cryptids", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "RevSquatchFultz", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1696646190.9780276, "created_utc": 1696522020.0, "url": "https://v.redd.it/25h58aze4zrb1", "title": "Is Bigfoot an interdimensional being?", "permalink": "/r/cryptids/comments/170ltd4/is_bigfoot_an_interdimensional_being/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 54, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "comment_count": 67, "over_18": false}}}
