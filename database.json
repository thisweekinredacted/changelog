Some of them have even been stopping cars and asking for a ride. This is such a report from Finland and it happened to two young men in the early 60\u2019s.\nIlmari Karunto was a man from Helsinki who was having a road trip vacation in Northern Finland together with a friend. It was a warm, sunny day in August, and after a stop to take a swim in a lake, the two friends decided to drive from Puolanka to Oulu. When they had been driving some 50 km (31 miles) from Puolanka, Karunto, who sat beside the driver, noticed a short man, at the side of the road. He had dark loose-fitting clothes and on his head he had something that looked like a dark brown beret and on his feet was white boots. With his hands up he signaled the men to stop and asked for a ride to a forest trail 5 km (3 miles) away. Karunto moved to the back seat and they began to drive.\nThe two men stopped to pick up a strange looking hitchhiker...\nIn the back seat Karunto started to wonder about the appearance of the strange man they picked up. His head was larger than usual, mouth broad and thin and nose quite big. His skin had a slightly greyish tone and the eyes were black and round. And when he happened to watch the man\u2019s eyes from the side mirror of the car, he saw to his astonishment that the man\u2019s eyelids closed from down to up. The man seemed to notice Ilmari\u2019s observation and put sunglasses on, and Karunto now saw that he had six, thin, grey-brown fingers. Karunto\u2019s friend did not seem to notice anything unusual about the stranger, but Karunto was now a little upset and asked where in Finland the man was living. This question seemed to make him thoughtfull, but then Karunto heard, like in his brain, that the stranger was not from Finland, but travelled around the world. Almost at once after this the trail came to sight and the man stepped out, thanked once again politely and began to walk along the forest trail. Karunto suggested to his friend that they should follow the mysterious man for a short moment.\nWhen the man had walked some 50 meters (55 yards) he came to a pile of brushwood some 3 meters (10 feet) high \u2013 and jumped on top of it and \u201dwalked\u201dover it.\u00a0\u201dLook, he can levitate!\u201d, said Karunto in awe to his friend, but they spoke yet nothing of the observation during the following car trip. Both men were very disturbed over what had just happened, but they decided to continue their journey.\nA metallic saucer shaped thing passed right above their heads.\nAfter a while they heard a humming noise, which became louder. Suddenly the car's engine started to cough, then stopped altogether. When they stepped outside, they saw a large round disc shaped object, perhaps 6 meters (20 feet) in diameter, fly low over their car at 5 - 6 meters (17-20 feet), make a wide turn and then disappear from sight. When they had recovered from the shock of this sighting, they tried to turn on the ignition of their car again and it started without problem. They continued their road trip and the next day they saw a small article in a local newspaper about a light phenomenon that people had seen flying northwards.\nSource: Tapani Kuningas - Ufoja suomen taivaalla (\"UFO:s over finnish skies\")\nThe mysterious hitchhiker.\nEvij\u00e4rvi, western Finland, October or November 1968.\nHelge Lindroos is a Finnish E.T. contactee and experiencer. He has been involved in several UFO sightings and encounters with aliens over the years. This is a peculiar story that happened to him when he was traveling in his car through Finland in the fall of '68 and it is another finnish story about a mysterious hitchhiker.\nHelge was going to drive down to Helsinki in southern Finland from Haapaj\u00e4rvi and on the way there he passed through the community of Evij\u00e4rvi. (anecdote: many places in Finland have \"j\u00e4rvi\" in their names and it means \"lake\"). It was about 11 pm when he passed the village, and soon after he saw a man standing at the side of the road, and he seemed to be a completely ordinary person. However, he was quite short (170 cm/ 5.6 feet), but had a normal build and was properly dressed. Helge felt and urge to help and stopped the car and the man just jumped in without a word.\nAlmost as soon as they started driving, Helge Lindroos felt wierd electric vibrations through his body. The hitchhiker did not talk much and the only thing he said was: \u201dILLAX!\u201d, and he said it out loud. This was a word Helge did not understand or what it meant. But after a while the stranger then told him that he was not from this planet, but came from outer space, and he had been visiting Mars and had then landed on Earth only a short time before. He said that there were thousands like him on Earth, but that they did not reveal themselves to all humans, since some people \u201care still afraid of aliens.\u201d Helge felt a little uncomfortable now, but the mysterious man told him to relax and assured him that he meant no harm. The man then explained that they were only here to protect humanity from destruction by ourselves.\nThe mysterious hitchhiker didnt say much except the strange word \\\"ILLAX!\\\".\nAt some unspecified point during the journey, the stranger asked Helge to stop the car. He parked at a rest area and the hitchhiker got out. Lindroos removed the car key and was going to get something to eat, since he got some sandwiches and a thermos of coffee in the trunk. When he stepped out of the car he saw that the stranger had vanished. Helge could see in every direction for 50 meters (55 yards) in the desolate rest area and beyond that was forest. But the hitchhiker was nowhere in sight, and the fastest sprinter in the world could not have covered the distance in just a few seconds. Helge felt very uneasy over the whole situation, and for several weeks after this encounter, he still often felt electric vibrations throughout his body and he was not himself. Helge Lindroos had a sensation that the mysterious man would one day return to meet him\u2026\nSource:\u00a0Tapani Kuningas and Ilkka Serra\nThe craft on the snowy road.\nTimovaara, eastern Finland, December 27 1973.\nOlavi Kolehmainen from Polvij\u00e4rvi was doing the night shift and was plowing the Timovaara road from snow. It was a small gravel road through the Karelian forest. When he came close to the Lipasvaara crossing at little over three o\u00b4clock in the morning, he noticed a strange steel-grey object about 4 meters wide (13 feet), which was standing on the road. The object was not emitting any light. Kolehmainen stopped his truck at a distance of 40 to 50 meters (44 - 55 Yards) and looked around to get some hint of what it was.\nA metallic craft landed on the snowy road right in front of the man and his snow plow truck. (credit to Jim Lawrence for adding the truck)\nAfter about a minute a hatch opened on the side of the object and against the bright light inside the object he could see first one, then two white clad, human like figures who were looking out from the opening. Kolehmainen realised this was no ordinary vehicle, and began to fear he would be abducted, as he had read in the stories, so he closed the truck\u2019s door and waited in the cabin with a knife in his hand. (As the Timovaara road is very narrow he could not turn his truck round and escape.)\nTimovaara Road is a small gravel route through a vast birch and pine forest. (source: Google Maps)\nHowewer, after some ten to fifteen seconds of mutual staring from him and the beings, the hatch was closed and a wining or buzzing sound could be heard. The sound became louder and some kind of smoke came from the object, after which it started to rise. The ascend continued and it vanished up on the sky towards the north. Kolehmainen listened to the object\u2019s distancing sound for a minute and then he stepped down onto the ground and went up to the place where the object had been. Three landing marks could be seen on the snow.\nSources: Illkka Serra, David Webb, Albert Rosales\nAlien \u201dcops\u201d stop the car.\nBetween Ylistaro and Lapua, western Finland, October 2 1980.\nThe time was 11:23 at night and a 23-year old man was driving from Vaasa\u00a0towards Lapua\u00a0on road 64, in order to have a late meal with friends at a local well known grill bar. When he was at the outskirts of Lapua near a small hill, he saw a bright light coming from the sky. It came closer to his position and suddenly the surroundings was lighten up and a glowing, disc-shaped, solid, object descended 10 meters (33 feet) in front of his car. The witness could not remember if he himself stopped the car or if somehow the object did it. The contours of the object were quite clear, it was a craft of some sort, and it somehow glowed and was appearing to be very hot. The craft was as broad as the road, about 6 meters (19.7 feet) and it had two white lights, one on each end of the hull, but no other details could be seen.\nThree beings from the glowing craft apporoached the witness car on the left side.\nThe craft hovered about half a meter (1.6 feet) obove the road surface, when suddenly two lights became visible in the middle of the object and three beings stepped out. The witness described them as quite human-like, but a little smaller and shorter. He did not see any ears or hair, but the eyes were very small. The humanoids walked towards him and came up to the left side door of the car - and that was all the witness could recall of the event. The next thing he remembered was that he was driving his car into the parking lot of the grill bar, but it was already closed as four hours had passed and it was now in the middle of the night. It was not very far to the grill bar and it should not have taken four hours to drive there. What happened during the missing time the witness had no memory of.\nSource:\u00a0Mervi Virtanen\nAbducted by Tall Whites(?) and Greys.\nLemp\u00e4\u00e4l\u00e4, south west Finland, spring 1992.\nIt was a spring evening in 1992 and 18-year-old Sami Taustila from Nokia was driving on the highway through Lemp\u00e4\u00e4l\u00e4. He was driving from Tampere and there were very few cars on the road this evening. Suddenly he noticed two red orbs of light over a railway bridge crossing the road. Soon the two orbs were joined by two more and then they were four and they flew in a diamond-shaped formation a little bit in front of him. Sami estimated the globes to be 2 meters (6.5 feet) in diameter and they hovered at a height of approximately 20 meters (65 feet) above the ground. Then he saw that on both sides of his car were several groups of light globes, 4 red orbs in each group. Sami was obviously worried, but continued to drive. After a while the globes moved to the side of his car and flew right next to it. Sami stopped his car on the highway, but did not get out of it. That's when it happened, and he saw a blue light inside the car:\n\"I don't know how it happened, but I was somehow moved outside of the car. Maybe it was done through the side window of the car? But after that there are no memories.\u201d Sami Taustila told a newspaper reporter who interviewed him.\nWhen Sami got near the railway bridge he looked up and saw two red glowing orbs in the sky ahead. (source: YLE)\nWhen Sami woke up again, he was in his car on the highway. Almost 24 hours had passed and he had no idea what had happened during all this time. What happened during the lost hours, Sami would then find out through hypnosis 30 years later:\nWhen Sami regained consciousness, he noticed that he was inside what appeared to be a craft. He looked around and realized he was in some sort of cockpit. But he was not alone. In front of him he saw dark shapes. His blurred vision now improved and he could see a humanoid woman in front of him. She was around 2 meters (6.5 feet) tall. She had milky white skin, long white hair and a beautiful, friendly smile. Sami noticed that she was communicating with him telepathically, for no spoken language from the mouth was used. She explains that he should not be afraid and that they come from what we humans call \"the Pleiades\" (the group of stars is also called \"the seven sisters\" and is located in the Taurus constellation 440 light years away from Earth). On a raised platform, Simo could also see three shorter gray beings with large heads and dark almond-shaped eyes. There was a lot of advanced technology and displays on the ship that Simo didn't understand.\nSoon Simo felt the craft was beginning to descend and he could see a large unknown city below him. Now two other beings approached him. These two seemed to be humans like himself. \u201cWelcome home!\u201d they said. It seemed like they knew him or knew who he was, but Simo didn\u2019t recognize these people.\nThe Tall Greys showed Sami a lot of \\\"cool stuff\\\" as he phrased it himself during an interview.\nSoon the ship arrived at a hangar in a large building and there Simo met more tall, white humanoids. Again he was assured not to be afraid and that they would not harm him. Simo was put in front of a display and they showed a lot of \"cool stuff\" in his own words. The colors on the screens were very strong and impressive. The beings then told Simo that now he must decide if he wanted to return to Earth. The other option was for the beings to take him to their home planet. The humanoids said he was one of them (?!). Simo felt a warmth and belonging from them and felt that he enjoyed being there with them, but said that he had to go home and could not leave his family on earth. Soon after this, Simo lost consciousness again, and when he woke up again, he was sitting in his car, which was on the side of the road in L\u00e4mp\u00e4\u00e4la. He continued his journey to Nokia and arrived to his home and his worried parents many hours later.\nSimo Taustila had thus lost a day without him knowing what had happened during all those hours. This is a phenomenon we have seen so many times before. This is a typical and classic \"Missing time\" event. And like similar cases, exciting details emerged during hypnosis. Simo has never been particularly interested in UFOs and similar paranormal phenomena and he seems to be a person with both feet on the ground. Of course, it is not out of the question that he made it all up, but he seems to be an honest person and not one to make up stories...\nSources: TV-show from YLE: \u201dUfotutkijat\u201d (UFO-investigators), Newspaper \u201dHelsingin Uutiset\u201d.\nSami is pointing out the place where he saw the orbs more than 30 years ago, to an investigator from Finnish TV. (source: YLE)\nThe Mantis-being in the window.\nSouthern Finland, November 2016 and September 2017.\nThis report came from a witness who had two strange sightings within a year. This happened while he was driving around on smaller lonely country roads in southern Finland.\nCase 1:\nIt was an evening in November 2016 and the man was on his way to M\u00e4nts\u00e4l\u00e4. On the way there, he drove on the country road through the quiet community of Ohkolantie. Shortly after he had passed the village, he suddenly saw in the glow of the car's headlights a strange creature crossing the road in front of him. It was grey, and with a long narrow head, large eyes and long, slender legs. It ran very quickly across the road on four legs. The man was sure it was not an animal and it was like no creature he had seen before. Later he found a picture of a cryptid online that he thought was similar. When he mentioned this to his friends, it was one of them who had also seen a similar looking creature once, when he was out driving.\nWhat kind of creature did the man see that was running across the road? Was it something otherwordly, a unknown cryptid or just a bear or wolf with Mange disease? (Bear with Mange on photo)\nCase 2:\nThe man was out driving again. It was at dawn one morning in September 2017 and he was driving on the old country road from Jokela towards Nurmij\u00e4rvi. On this stretch there was an old, abandoned house that stood right next to the road. The man often drove this road and almost always slowed down a little to look at the derelict house, and he often wondered who lived there once upon a time.\nThis morning the sun's rays were reflected in the window of the deserted, old house. And that's when he saw something that really scared him. Downstairs, he saw a pale gray, human-sized creature with a triangular head and enormous eyes peering out of one of the windows. As he looked at the creature, he felt its gaze bore into his mind. It was difficult to explain how it was experienced, according to the man. He sped away from the scene. The man did not dare to drive on this road for a long time afterwards. But after a while he dared to pass the old house again, and he never saw the creature more after this. According to UFO investigators, UFO phenomena had also been reported in the area around Nurmij\u00e4rvi during the same time.\nAn otherwordly Mantis-like creature was seen in one of the windows of the old, derelict house as the witness passed by in his car.\nThese are two cases that make you wonder a little. What did the man actually see? Could it be that it was only animals he saw, but in the poor light and with a little vivid imagination, it turned out to be horrible creatures instead? Did someone make a prank and put a doll in the window? We don't know, and according to the man, he was sure that these were not ordinary animals or dolls that he saw.\nSource: Fufora", "media": null, "score": 36, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "comment_count": 9, "over_18": false}, "10": {"id": "1i7056w", "locked": false, "subreddit": "cryptids", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "Gxnjitsu", "link_flair_text": "Question", "time": 1737773512.361703, "created_utc": 1737511902.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/7t2eyoayegee1.jpeg", "title": "Caught this on backdoor cam", "permalink": "/r/cryptids/comments/1i7056w/caught_this_on_backdoor_cam/", "selftext": "Hey everyone!

I chose a Coppertone ad for the browns and pastels. As I was working on the animation, Stan posted the exact same ad on Facebook. I asked him what compelled him to do it and he said it just sort of called to him.\nAfter he passed, I was telling my mother about all the strange coincidences we shared. As I was doing that, I \"felt\" something rush through me. It was like a sudden, brief but very strong gust of air. I freaked out and stood and looked around. My mother, concerned, said she didn't see anything. \nWas it him, just stopping by to say goodbye?", "media": null, "score": 35, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "comment_count": 1, "over_18": false}, "12": {"id": "1i5fjmj", "locked": false, "subreddit": "letsnotmeet", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Feral_doves", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1737773512.688995, "created_utc": 1737338878.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1i5fjmj/date_invited_me_to_a_fake_barbecue_and_then/", "title": "Date invited me to a fake barbecue and then wouldn\u2019t let me leave, house had a \u2018soundproof music studio\u2019 in the basement ", "permalink": "/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1i5fjmj/date_invited_me_to_a_fake_barbecue_and_then/", "selftext": "I\u2019m so sorry this is so long, maybe I included too much detail, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t post very often. I\u2019ll put a tldr at the end.\nThis took place a while ago (2015ish) but I\u2019ll probably never forget it. I (around 21 at the time, f) was still fairly new in my city. I had just gotten out of a bad relationship, wasn\u2019t in the best place mentally and didn\u2019t know a lot of people in town besides my ex and his friends. I was on a dating/hookup app looking for people to hang out casually with, maybe find a fwb or something. I had matched with a 25 year old guy, \u2018Simon\u2019. We talked sporadically in the app for a few days. He explained he was in a band and living in a house with his bandmates. He sent me their music, it was just audio on YouTube with a heavily edited still image of four or five guys playing rock instruments, one of them looked like him. The music was an interesting combination of styles and not really for me, but whatever, he seemed like a nice enough guy. He stopped replying for a few days and I figured that was that, moved on.\u00a0\nThen one day I was at work and got a message from him saying sorry he\u2019d been so busy and inviting me to a barbecue with his friends and bandmates in their yard. He had explained that their \u2018band manager\u2019 was providing them the house to live in. Based on the lack of views on the YouTube video and the fact I only saw one photo of him playing in the band I figured he was probably exaggerating the \u2018band manager\u2019 thing. I thought it was more likely something along the lines of a bar manager friend giving them a discount on rent in exchange for being a house band at their bar or something and didn\u2019t think much of it beyond that.\u00a0\nNormally I would have just said no to going to a barbecue alone at the home of someone I really didn\u2019t know. But I was really bored and figured I might be able to overcome some social anxiety and maybe even make some female friends there since he made it sound like a pretty big party. I put the neighbourhood he gave me into maps and it was a suburban are with lots of families as far as I knew. I figured being in a yard on such a nice summer day wouldn\u2019t be overly risky because lots of neighbours would be outside. Plus it was just a few train stops away from my workplace and I was off in a few hours.\nI did tell him I wasn\u2019t overly comfortable with the idea since I didn\u2019t know him well, but I would stop by for a bit if I didn\u2019t need to go inside the house at all. He said that was totally fine which made me feel a lot better. I even made sure to not drink anything for the rest of my shift so I wouldn\u2019t be risking needing to go inside to use the bathroom. I was anxious about just showing up to a BBQ with people I didn\u2019t know at all, as he implied that the event was already underway, plus I would\u2019ve had a hard time finding a specific address from the backyard side so I asked Simon if he could meet me at the train station since he said it was a quick walk anyway. He agreed to do that and I let him know when I was leaving work and what time maps said the train would get to his station.\u00a0\nI sent Simon a message to tell him that I had arrived at the train station around 5:30 after I looked around and couldn\u2019t find him. He told me he was running behind and to just start walking toward the neighbourhood. I was about halfway across the massive train station parking lot when I saw him slowly wandering toward me. I recognized his clothes (wearing bellbottoms when they were not common, especially for men) and long hair from far away, but up close his face looked pretty different from his photos. It might\u2019ve been some heavy duty editing, I don\u2019t even know, but he kinda looked like a different guy. Older looking than the \u201825 year old\u2019 guy in the photos by 5-10 years, maybe used photos of his brother or something, I don\u2019t even know, it was before AI. This was the first real red flag, but I brushed it off. Maybe he\u2019s just self conscious, maybe he smokes a lot and doesn\u2019t wear sunscreen and hasn\u2019t taken pictures in a while (all of his pictures looked candid so I figured he wasn\u2019t much of a selfie guy). And besides, I\u2019m mostly here to make friends anyway so I shouldn\u2019t judge his appearance so harshly. He was also clearly already drunk but a lot of my ex\u2019s friends were heavy drinkers so that didn\u2019t seem strange, he\u2019s hosting a BBQ after all.\u00a0\nThe second red flag came shortly after when we arrived at the front door. I reminded him that I wasn\u2019t comfortable going inside the house, but he assured me we would just have to walk through to get to the back yard. Ok fine. It wasn\u2019t the kind of neighbourhood where you could just walk around the house to get to the back yard, we would\u2019ve had to back track to the main road to go down the alley directly to the backyard. I figured he just forgot what I said about not wanting to go inside and didn\u2019t want to cause a bunch of trouble so I went with it.\nWe got in the house and he immediately closed the door and locked the deadbolt and knob behind me. I didn\u2019t think that was tooo weird since nobody was hanging out inside and a lot of people are just in the habit of locking the door when they come in, but it did still give me the heebie jeebies for some reason. Then Simon then told me he\u2019d really like to give me a tour of the house. I politely declined and reminded him that l was just there for the BBQ. He said that he and his bandmates had worked really hard to get the house and he was really proud of it. At that point I was getting really skeptical because usually when guys would tell me things that seemed a bit far fetched they\u2019d let the truth slip by the time they got me to their house.\nBut still, I convinced myself that I was being unreasonable, I was already in the stupid house anyway. He insisted it\u2019d be quick. Not the wisest choice, I know. But I was pretty good at explaining away red flags so at this point Simon still mostly had a dopey stoner art guy kind of vibe as far as I was concerned. He really didn\u2019t seem like a threat, just an insecure oddball who sucks at communicating and fibs a bit. Not unlike my ex who was definitely emotionally and verbally abusive but it never escalated past that. I figured at worst he\u2019d get handsy and I\u2019d get called a prude for not sleeping with him. I didn\u2019t have a lot of self worth at the time obviously so I went with it.\nThe tour started pretty uneventfully other than that the decor in the common areas was obviously chosen by a middle aged Martha Stuart enthusiast and not a bunch of guys in a band or their fake band manager. I didn\u2019t know if this should make me feel better or worse. On one hand he was clearly lying, but on the other it made me think it was probably just someone\u2019s mom\u2019s house and she was out of town and he didn\u2019t wanna tell me he lived at (a friend\u2019s parent\u2019s) home and didn\u2019t actually have a paying job. Again, total red flag, but I could rationalize it at the time.\u00a0\nThe bedroom doors were all closed, bathroom was unremarkable. He then showed me the kitchen and I finally saw through the window that there was nobody in the backyard. There weren\u2019t even BBQ supplies around. No burgers thawing on the counter, no cocktail supplies lying around, nothing. I asked him where everyone was and why he lied about the BBQ, and he told me that his bandmates were on tour still, they were just running behind due to van trouble but they should be back any minute so we could start the party. I asked him why he wasn\u2019t on tour with them if he\u2019s in the band. I don\u2019t even remember what his answer was to that because it didn\u2019t make any sense. At this point I\u2019m out of mental gymnastics to convince myself that this guy isn\u2019t just completely full of shit, and I\u2019m really freaked out (took me long enough. I\u2019m smarter now don\u2019t worry).\u00a0\nI started trying to figure out a way to get out of this situation. I hoped that once he was done the tour we could go outside, even just for a minute, and I\u2019d just leave. I\u2019d been in some sketchy situations in the past, but luckily nothing so bad that they tried very hard to physically stop me when I walked away in a semi-public place, I just wasn\u2019t comfortable doing it inside the house. I knew this guy was full of shit but I had no idea how much worse it would get.\u00a0\nI instinctively pretended to believe his bullshit. He offered me a beer, I said no thanks because I had to work in the morning. He said ok and cracked one for himself. Then he wanted to take the tour downstairs, I could see from the top of the stairs that the basement was the dark and creepy kind with really small windows, so I refused. I asked if we could go back outside. He said after the tour. I tried to argue about going into the basement, told him I have a spider phobia, don\u2019t like basements, etc. (all lies but anything that wouldn\u2019t let him realize that HE was what I was afraid of). He started to get agitated about my reluctance, so I figured it would be better to just let him show me the damn basement and then hopefully we could go outside because I really didn\u2019t know what else to do.\u00a0\nThe basement was fairly unremarkable. Couch, tv, elliptical. Until I noticed something that gave me chills. The house was probably built in the 1990s or late 80s at the absolute earliest, but I saw a door that looked just like the heavy, foam lined door to the cold storage room in my grandma\u2019s house. The kind that only open from the outside. It was just a smaller version of the big metal doors on commercial walk-in fridges, it looked really out of place in this house.\u00a0\nI would absolutely not go anywhere near that door. He opened it and told me it was their \u2018soundproof music studio\u2019. I looked inside from a few meters away. It did indeed look soundproof, it was about the size of a bedroom and I could see a few guitars and amps in it. Mattress toppers on the walls. No drum kit or recording equipment that I could see. He insisted I go inside to get a better look. He was standing outside the door motioning for me to go inside. Holy shit the alarm bells are really going off now. At this point I realized I could totally die here if I\u2019m not careful and I turned around to run up the stairs. He closed the door and followed me, asking what\u2019s wrong, acting like I\u2019m being all unreasonable for not wanting to see his soundproof \u2018music studio\u2019. So I\u2019m realizing that this is a way sketchier situation than any of my ex\u2019s bullshit and I\u2019m freeaaaked right out.\nAt that point my main objective was getting out of the house. The front and back doors were both closed and locked so if I tried to run he\u2019d be able to get to me before I could get the locks open. The bathroom did not have a window. The house had a convoluted floor plan that I wasn\u2019t familiar with and he was much bigger than I am. He was the tall lanky type, who can run fast even if they\u2019re out of shape and smoke a pack a day. I pretended that I was ok with hanging out with him in the hopes that he\u2019d chill out a bit. We made smalltalk for a few minutes, he cracked another beer and thankfully he calmed down. I desperately mentioned yet again that it was beautiful outside and suggested we go sit in the yard while we wait. He said no and started to get agitated that I wanted to leave already. I told him that I could stay but I\u2019d just really like to smoke a cigarette. He told me that we could smoke cigarettes inside, and pointed to a cereal bowl full of cigarette butts. Goddamn it. We sat down at the table and lit some cigarettes. As he was smoking he started rolling a joint, which he promptly lit as soon as his cig was done. He offered me some and I said no thanks. He insisted so I took the smallest puff I could. I\u2019m a pretty seasoned weed smoker but I pretended to cough excessively and told him I\u2019m a novice so that\u2019s more than enough for me. For a liar himself he thankfully wasn\u2019t very good at picking up on the lies of others.\nAfter we smoked he asked if I\u2019d like to watch a movie until his bandmates get back. I told him that I was really looking forward to spending the day outside and suggested we go for a walk or visit the park. Ideas he did not like or appreciate. At this point i was trying to keep as much distance as possible between us but he stayed close enough to me that I could smell the beer on his breath. He grabbed me by the waist and and I backed away and asked about the BBQ food to try and change the subject and make him think I still believed what he was telling me. He started to get angry again, and sternly reiterated that his bandmates should be home any minute, and my anxiety was absolutely through the roof. I tried to calm him down again with generic small talk.\nNow I don\u2019t know how I got so lucky, but the next thing that happened might\u2019ve saved me. Simon went to the fridge to get another beer and pulled out an empty box. At this point he\u2019s getting even more pissed off than before, so I went out on a limb and suggested we go get some more beer \u2018for the party\u2019. Because I was out of ideas. I was terrified that it would enrage him even more to suggest, once again, that we leave the house, but I had to try. Thankfully though, his eyes lit up with the possibility that I could actually be down to drink with him and he agreed.\u00a0\nAs we were walking to the liquor store I still didn\u2019t really have a plan because I was no longer comfortable just walking away from this fucking menace in this weirdly desolate suburb. But I was extremely relieved to be out of that house. I walked with him to the liquor store and when we got there told him I didn\u2019t need to go inside if he was just gonna go grab some beer. He insisted that I had to go inside, at that point I was so stressed and frazzled I just went with him and hoped that a good opportunity to leave would arise.\u00a0\nWhen we got inside the liquor store he asked what kind of beer I wanted. I reminded him that I had to work tomorrow and didn\u2019t want to drink much. He demanded to know what kind of beer I wanted so I just named the first one that came to mind. We went to pay, the cashier was kind of an asshole so I didn\u2019t ask for help. I probably should\u2019ve but I panicked and didn\u2019t. I hoped there might be somebody in the parking lot who might help me if I made a scene, but there was nobody. I really regretted not asking the liquor store guy for help, but also remembered the times my ex told people I was crazy so they wouldn\u2019t take me seriously. Liquor store guy definitely seemed like he would\u2019ve fell for that, so probably for the best I didn\u2019t expect him to help me.\u00a0\nI had one last idea before I took my chances just trying to run and/or scream. There was a drugstore across from the liquor store, I told Simon I had to go buy a toothbrush or some shit that vaguely implied I might stay over. He eagerly agreed to this but tried to follow me into the store. I told him that you\u2019re not allowed to bring beer into a drugstore. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s even true, I really doubt it\u2019s any kind of law, but luckily this drunk douchebag believed it and agreed to wait outside.\u00a0\nNow, my naive ass thought maybe I could just wander around in this drugstore for long enough and he would either get the hint or get sketched out or bored and leave. But no, I must\u2019ve wandered around the store for at least half an hour and this jackass is still just standing there staring in the window. This creep didn\u2019t even have his phone out, every time I checked if he was still there he was just staring through the window looking for me. I didn\u2019t feel like I had anybody I could call in the city to come help me, the cops here don\u2019t usually take things like this very seriously, and the store workers looked like they were mostly high school students and I didn\u2019t want to drag them into this so I really didn\u2019t feel like I had a lot of options. After being in there for so long I was surprised he didn\u2019t come in to see what was taking me so long. I thought maybe I could lose him in the aisles and sneak out of the store if he did come in but nope.\u00a0\nI ended up hovering around the tills and waited until a big group of friendly looking people were paying. I followed them out of the store and immediately told Simon to leave me alone and go home. I said it firmly and loudly enough to imply that I would make a scene if need be. Simon looked at the people getting in their car, who where now pausing and looking at us because I had nearly yelled at him, and then he just turned around and left. It was bizarrely anticlimactic, which I was very thankful for. I ran to the train station, which thankfully was in a different direction than his house from the store, and I never heard from him again. When I got home his app profile had either blocked me or been deleted.\u00a0\nYears later after I stopped compartmentalizing the whole thing I wish I would have reported him or something. It bothers me to wonder if he tried it again with someone else but made sure the fridge was stocked first. But at the time I didn\u2019t think anybody would take me seriously, I was embarrassed of my choices, and I just wanted to move on from the whole thing. Plus, all I really had was a (likely fake) first name and a general idea of where the house was, which probably wasn\u2019t even his.\u00a0\nI\u2019ll probably never know any more than I do now, and maybe that\u2019s for the best. Anyway, \u2018Simon\u2019, you lying pos, let\u2019s not meet.\nTLDR: In my early 20s I met a man on a hookup app and agreed to go to a barbecue he and his bandmates were hosting at their house in the suburbs. When I met up with him he was really drunk, looked different from his photos, his bandmates were nowhere to be found, and the decor in the house didn\u2019t look like it was theirs. He locked the door and got angry every time I asked to go outside. After a tour of the house that included a \u2018soundproof music studio\u2019 and no evidence of a barbecue, I was able to escape by suggesting we visit the liquor store together after he ran out of beer; and telling him to leave me alone once we were around a group of people.", "media": null, "score": 2058, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comment_count": 104, "over_18": true}, "13": {"id": "1i5rvkn", "locked": false, "subreddit": "truecreepy", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "HamletX95", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1737773512.8201728, "created_utc": 1737384796.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/icwcinpzw5ee1.jpeg", "title": "Parker\u2013Hulme murder case - two best friends made created a fantasy realm called 'the fourth world.'

Chief of Police Barney Rosenhagen and municipal worker Chris Louis arrived at the town hall, which also served as the police station and firehouse. The building was unusually cold, prompting Barney to send Chris to check the furnace. What Chris discovered would leave the town reeling for decades.\nChris unlocked the cellar doors leading to the furnace room. Inside, he encountered a dark, human-like figure slumped in a corner. Believing he had seen a ghost, Chris fled and alerted Barney. The two men returned, only to be confronted by a horrific reality. The figure spoke, saying, \u201cI\u2019m cold.\u201d It was Elfrieda Knaak, a 30-year-old woman from Deerfield, Illinois, severely burned and naked. Barney wrapped her in a blanket and summoned help.\nElfrieda was a well-known figure in Deerfield, one of eleven children born to Dr. Theodore Knaak, a respected local physician. At the time of her death, she was working as a door-to-door encyclopedia salesperson. On October 29, she had attended a sales meeting in Chicago, phoning her family afterward to inform them she\u2019d return home shortly. However, a broken-down bus diverted her route to Lake Bluff, where her movements became a mystery.\nInvestigators discovered Elfrieda in a furnace room with two heating units. The smaller, gravity-fed water boiler was identified as the source of her burns. Her personal items, including her watch and shoes, were found nearby, but most of her clothing was missing. Burn marks and ash remnants suggested her head and body had been in contact with the boiler\u2019s hot coals. She suffered third-degree burns on 30% of her body, with devastating injuries to her hands, feet, and head. Despite these injuries, Elfrieda clung to life for three days, during which she offered cryptic statements to detectives, alternately claiming responsibility for her injuries and hinting at foul play.\nElfrieda\u2019s fragmented words included, \u201cI did it, it was me,\u201d as well as references to a \u201cHitch\u201d and statements like, \u201cHe pushed me down\u201d and \u201cWhy did they do it?\u201d Despite her confession, questions about the involvement of others lingered. She succumbed to her injuries on November 2, leaving behind more questions than answers.\nPolice focused their investigation on Charles \u201cHitch\u201d Hitchcock, a local speech instructor and town watchman. Elfrieda had taken his speech classes, leading to speculation about a potential relationship. Charles, a married father of four, denied any personal connection to Elfrieda and provided an alibi, supported by a doctor\u2019s confirmation of his recent ankle injury. His wife, Estelle, also vouched for him but admitted she could not confirm his whereabouts on the night of October 29. Other individuals connected to Elfrieda were also scrutinized. Among them were a violin instructor who shared studio space with Charles and a spiritualist who visited Elfrieda in the hospital. Letters from a \u201cB. Lock\u201d, traced to a Mrs. Roch from Libertyville, hinted at a deeper relationship, but investigators found no evidence linking these individuals to the incident. Even Elfrieda\u2019s best friend, Marie Mueller, who harbored feelings for Charles, was questioned without result.\nAmid these inquiries, detectives uncovered a potential clue in Elfrieda\u2019s home. A book titled Christ in You contained an underlined passage about \u201cthe purifying power of pain\u201d and \u201cThe Refiner\u2019s Fire,\u201d suggesting she may have been influenced by spiritual or religious beliefs about suffering. This finding bolstered the theory of suicide, but inconsistencies in the case continued to trouble the Knaak family.\nUnexplained bloodstains on the furnace room door and the locked state of the room when Chris discovered Elfrieda raised doubts about the official narrative. The family hired a private investigator, but no new evidence emerged. Over the years, multiple individuals falsely confessed to the crime, including a chauffeur, a self-proclaimed occultist, and a man claiming to be an Egyptian hypnotist. All were eventually dismissed as hoaxes.\nThe mystery deepened when crucial evidence, including the coroner\u2019s report, autopsy photos, and items from the furnace room, disappeared in the 1980s after the death of a police chief. This loss rendered further investigation impossible.\nAdding another layer of intrigue, Marie Mueller married Charles Hitchcock 14 years after Elfrieda\u2019s death. Following Charles\u2019 passing in 1964, Marie\u2019s niece revealed that Marie had confessed to a romantic involvement involving herself, Elfrieda, and Charles, and claimed to know the truth about Elfrieda\u2019s death. However, Marie refused to share details, leaving these assertions unverified.\nToday, the tragic death of Elfrieda Knaak remains an unsolved mystery.

Now, I may be biased, but my boy/girl twins are exceptionally cute but weirdly, do not even look related.  My son, in particular, got a lot of attention due to his strawberry blonde hair and giant blue eyes. \nSo I head out to target with my twinsies, park slightly far away from the main entrance because I like to be close to where you can bring the carts back and there was not a ton of cars in this row.   As I am getting out, me and another couple who parked near me, smile at each other, as their son is clearly the same age as my kids.   Dad is a BEAR of a man, huge, beard for days, arms like tree trunks.\nAs I am walking around target, looking at all the things we don't need, I vaguely notice two couples who are in a lot of the same areas as me.  They aren't speaking English, if I was going to guess, they were possibly Russian but I couldn't really tell. \nFast forward I get on line behind one of the couples, My daughter is in the seat part of the cart and my son is in the wide open part.   Out of nowhere, the lady from the couple behind me is all up in my cart and my person space.  The couple in front of me, after paying. Doesn't get out of the way.  (weird, move over guys, wtf are you doing?)  The lady behind me, leans Completely over my cart. and places herself in between me and my son.  I have literally  no idea what she doing.  Still. It seems like her main objective was to block my eyeline to him.  \nI have my hands on my daughter,  but I can't even see my son. She's a big lady.  She is quite obviously very much too close to my children.  She is leaning totally over my cart to the point that her body  is like resting on both sides of it.  Again> I CANT EVEN SEE my child anymore who up until  two mins ago was less than 10 inches away from me. \nI had asked her to back up when she started inching closer, but she just responded in her native language.   I gestured to show her what I meant.  I repeatedly ask her to please move, excuse me, etc. I am obviously trying to get her to move away from my children.  Even if you don't speak the same language, pretty clear what the point of the message I was making is.  \nShe blatantly ignores me. I'm trying to lean around her to grab my son and throw him onto the conveyor belt just to get him away from this couple...bc seriously, what are you trying to do here??\nShe refuses to move, and I can't get to my son. This continues to go on for several minutes.  We aren't even checked out bc I have items in my cart I can't reach.  I am also blocked in on the other side by this other couple who are standing completely on top of me. \nAt this point, I am full on yelling at the women to get the fuck away from my kid.  I finally grab my cart and Smash it as hard as I can into her and she starts yelling at me  in ? and backs up just enough for me to grab my son.  Whose now hysterical.\nThe 16 year old cashier was useless even though the whole time I was screaming at her to call security. \nTHE BEAR from earlier sees this all taking place, and rushes himself and his family over to my side,  He manages to push the other couple away from me and we basically ditch all my attempted purchases and he gets me and my twins back to our cars safely.  Him and his wife followed me for a bit onto the highway to make sure we weren't being followed by any other cars. \nSo to the tourists at target who attempted to.... I don't know what you were attempting .....but you raised ALL MY MAMA RED FLAGS and you are lucky I didn't smash my keys into your face bc that was my next move.  Lets not meet \nand to the Papa Bear who was the only reason I felt like I got out of that target safely.

I always liked drawing and I kept drawing dead people and fascinated with death. \nOne day I was at home drawing, and while I used to draw just black / white and red, that day I started to draw a flower that\u2019s when I noticed that was odd, was colorful. My drawing process I don\u2019t always think of what to draw I let my imagination flow. When I started to notice that was odd, I saw what seemed to be a  Spotlight very bright light in front of me, and it spoke. \nI was fully awake, and it felt ancient it didn\u2019t speak with actual words I don\u2019t know how to explain but was in my mind, sometimes it would speak through projecting images instead. It asked if it could come in, I don\u2019t recall my exact reaction I remember thinking if it could be a bad choice to say yes, but agreed to let it come in even not understanding exactly what it meant, it was in front of me. I think I agreed because it didn\u2019t seem like a threat. \nI recall very little of what we talked, I remember bits and pieces it did tell me in the end I was meant to forget. I will try to describe it the best way I can.\nWhen I agreed to let it in, I felt a huge overwhelming powerful feeling of love, truly loved in a deep and infinite way. Next I asked it if it was an angel ( I went to catholic school but I wasn\u2019t religious, still not) to which it replied no. I asked if it was God, to which it replied no. I asked what it was, and it showed me, but I don\u2019t understand it, it seemed like a very ancient being, older than what I could imagine time is. Like if it existed before time existed. \nI asked more things, curiosities of a 12 year old, why is there so much pain the world? Why are we here? Whats the point of all this? To which it replied I don\u2019t remember all the answers, I distinctly remember seeing parts of the world like if it was in real time, some appeared to be just visions. In the end it went away, I remember my mom coming into the room and thinking why cant she see it? That\u2019s how I realize it was in my head. \nWhen it went away it told me one day I was going to try to kill myself and not to do it, it made me promise I wouldn\u2019t, to which I did. Such thought never entered my head at that time. Also it asked me not to waste time trying to learn more about it and move on, to which I agreed and finally once it left I felt clean inside, like all the negativity was washed away. This experience was very deep for me, it changed who I was since then. I remember asking if I would see it again but don\u2019t remember the answer, most likely was no because I never saw it since then.\nI did try to kill myself many years later I remember promising I wouldn\u2019t and thats how I\u2019m still here. I also failed to not try and find more information about what that was, I did look for more people who might of seen the same and found odd connections. To which I will share. Also writing this to try and find others who came across the same being, or similar.

It was not from my phone. My phone was on silent and there also weren\u2019t any new notifications. Why would this happen? I didn\u2019t have anyone close to me recently pass. Just looking for a reasonable explanation. I don\u2019t recall ever having an experience similar to this in this house and I\u2019ve lived here my whole life. \nThanks in advance!
