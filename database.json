Thanks.)\nBefore I get into my story, here\u2019s some background info: Every day, usually after finishing homework or if I was just bored and had nothing to do, I\u2019d take my dirt bike on a run to the nearest grocery store which was about 3 miles away from where I live. To get there, I had to bike through one-way streets that snaked throughout the secluded neighborhoods of the area. All of the houses in these neighborhoods looked surprisingly upper middle class, which was strange considering my neighborhood (which was just down the hill) looked nowhere near as rich. But I didn\u2019t mind it too much, focusing more on how quiet and peaceful the drive through these streets was. To get to these streets, I had to chug my bike up multiple hills, which was a bit of a drag since my bike did pretty badly uphill, but taking these streets was safer than taking the main roads.\u00a0\nThis happened on the 15th of last month. It was a Friday, which meant that I could stay up late and play video games. My friends from school whom I typically played with, weren\u2019t online so I had nothing to do. In the mood for some chocolates, I decided to take a night-time bike ride. My ride to the grocery store was normal. I parked my bike, got my chocolates, and headed back. Since it was nighttime, I decided to take the normal streets since there weren\u2019t many cars on the road. As I exited the normal streets and began my descent down the one-way streets that cut through the secluded neighborhoods, I noticed a car following close behind. This guy\u2019s headlights were cranked all the way up, which reflected through my bike\u2019s side mirrors, blinding me through my helmet. I decided to pull over and let the guy pass. I stopped my bike behind a car parked in front of the house. Like all of the houses on the block, the lights inside were off, so I wasn\u2019t worried of the owner of the house seeing me and thinking \u201cwhy is that suspicious biker just sitting there behind my car?\u201d Also, I was mostly wearing all black so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if someone could mistake me for someone shady.\u00a0\nI was probably sitting on my bike for about a minute waiting for this guy to pass, but his car hadn\u2019t turned the last corner. I didn\u2019t see any headlights coming down the road so I figured he wasn\u2019t coming. Before I continued on my way, I decided to take in the night air. I flipped open the visor of my helmet and took in a deep breath. I turned off my bike\u2019s motor. It may sound like I\u2019m sugarcoating this but once I turned off my motor, the entite area fell dead silent. All that could be heard were the faint chittering of crickets the wind blowing through the trees above. I just sat there with my head up to the sky, eyes closed and arms limb at my side. It was so peaceful.\u00a0\nAll of a sudden, the distracting pitter-patter of footsteps came within earshot. Turning towards the footsteps, I noticed that they were coming from across the street. The footsteps didn\u2019t sound like a typical person\u2019s. They sounded much heavier. Suddenly, I saw a tall black figure emerge from behind a garden hedge in front of a home across the street from me. Whatever this thing was was tall and fast. If I had to estimate how tall it was, I\u2019d say that it was nearing the seven-foot range. At this point, I was frozen with fear. The only part of me that moved was my head as I watched the figure run down the driveway of the home (the one with the garden hedge) and run the opposite way from me across the street. But as the figure crossed the street, the moonlight illuminated it, giving me somewhat of a clear picture of it. It looked like a stereotypical depiction of a werewolf: sharp claws, bent legs, mangy fur, pointed ears, a toothy muzzle, ETC. Basically just a wolf-human hybrid. My heart sank. The creature dissapered in the shadows cast by the homes across the street but I could still hear its heavy footsteps as they grew further and further away. A minute passed. Then another. I was left sitting on my bike, confused and frozen in fear. I didn\u2019t want to move, let alone turn on my bike\u2019s motor and alert everything in the area where I was. But I had no choice. I silently hopped off my bike and manually turned it the opposite way. I got on my bike and the instant I turned on my bike\u2019s motor, and sped off. The ride back was a blur. All I remember was me zooming down the streets. I definitely was not going the speed limit, never the less stopping at stop signs. I just had to get out of there as fast as I could. Thank God that thing didn\u2019t see me hiding in the darkness.\u00a0\nThe second I got home, I told my parents the whole thing. Of course, they didn\u2019t believe me. I looked up on my computer if tonight was a full moon. To my horror, it was. I didn\u2019t get any sleep that night, fearing that thing followed me home and was stalking me through my window. Jesus. I\u2019m getting chills as I write this. I\u2019ve kept this story a secret from my friends as I know that if I tell them they\u2019d think I\u2019m crazy. This is the first time I\u2019ve talked about the story in full. I\u2019ve been hit by a truck, bitten by a pitbull (I promise I\u2019m not a werewolf lol), and almost drowned, but this was by far the scariest thing I have ever encountered. I haven\u2019t gotten on my bike since.\u00a0\nI imagine that if werewolves did live in or near Los Angeles, the area where I live, Monterey Hills, would be the best place for them to hide as its on the outskirts of everything and each neighborhood is surrounded by empty hills. I attached a photo of the street where this occurred. What do you guys think? I feel good getting this off my chest :)\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qbtaj05eis6e1.png?width=2012&format=png&auto=webp&s=d482d8cf0658200ce65b10022f506e2dae49a940", "media": null, "score": 141, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comment_count": 25, "over_18": false}, "10": {"id": "1hh4kq6", "locked": false, "subreddit": "cryptids", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "ArtisticDragonKing", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1734749876.5456238, "created_utc": 1734537279.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/htgk2e1vpm7e1.jpeg", "title": "IS THIS THE JERSEY DEVIL?", "permalink": "/r/cryptids/comments/1hh4kq6/is_this_the_jersey_devil/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 1301, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comment_count": 94, "over_18": false}, "11": {"id": "1hhpmhc", "locked": false, "subreddit": "thetruthishere", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Platomik", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1734749876.7895916, "created_utc": 1734602336.0, "url": "/r/AskReddit/comments/1hhj6cc/military_veterans_of_reddit_whats_the_creepiest/", "title": "Military veterans of Reddit, what's the creepiest thing you ever saw while deployed that you couldn't explain?", "permalink": "/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1hhpmhc/military_veterans_of_reddit_whats_the_creepiest/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 168, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comment_count": 46, "over_18": false}, "12": {"id": "1he7qtx", "locked": false, "subreddit": "letsnotmeet", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "KITTYCat0930", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1734749877.0140696, "created_utc": 1734197181.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1he7qtx/i_was_assaulted_by_a_friend_who_was_in_love_with/", "title": "I was assaulted by a friend who was in love with me", "permalink": "/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1he7qtx/i_was_assaulted_by_a_friend_who_was_in_love_with/", "selftext": "This happened over 10 years ago but I still think about how close I came to dying. \nI was already with my future husband when I met his cousin. We had a lot in common. We\u2019d both struggled with addiction and anorexia. \nWe\u2019d talk on the phone and met up to eat and see a movie but he kissed me in his car so I decided it was best if we stopped talking. I told my future husband about the kiss and he was understanding. \nI didn\u2019t tell him that his cousin got extremely upset over me turning him down. \nSometime passed and we started meeting up as friends. Since we were both starving ourselves we always went to the same place but after a couple times I felt like it wasn\u2019t healthy for either of us to meet up. \nHe asked me to meet up one last time and I stupidly said yes. We went to our place and during dinner he was talking about his apartment and job. How happy he could make me. I got uncomfortable and asked him to drive me home. \nIt was really late and instead of driving me home he drove to the forest preserve. It was pitch black because all the lights were off. I immediately felt uneasy. \nWe were alone in the parking lot and I had a horrible feeling at this point that something was going to happen. He parked and turned off his car then looked at me and said we were meant for each other  I didn\u2019t want to upset him so I just said that he knew I was engaged and that we were just friends. He had a history of violence so I was terrified. \nHe started getting really upset and almost crying he said that he loved me. Then he put his arm around my neck and held his arm down really hard on my right side of my neck. His arm was around my neck and I\u2019d been looking straight ahead when suddenly I woke up to a police officer at his window. \nHe was asking if I was okay. I was really scared and confused. I had some vomit on my shirt and I\u2019d wet my pants. He\u2019d pressed down on my carotid artery for long enough that it knocked me out. He was a wrestler in hs. \nHe was telling the officer we were fine and that I was drunk. He got a ticket but I was too afraid to say anything because if he was arrested my now husband\u2019s family wouldn\u2019t have blamed me but that\u2019s what I thought. \nI said I was fine but that\u2019s I wanted to go home now. I thought if I said it in front of the officer he would drive me home because he took our names and he wouldn\u2019t risk trying something else. \nSo he drove me home and didn\u2019t say anything. I don\u2019t know if he was trying to kill me or just got so upset he went way overboard. Regardless he almost did kill me and it really fucked me up.A person doesn\u2019t vomit and wet themselves after a neck compression unless they almost died. \nI told my now husband but not right away because I felt like it was partly my fault for meeting up with him. I only saw him a couple more times at holidays and then he stopped coming. But he didn\u2019t dare speak to me after what he did. If that officer hadn\u2019t shown up I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d be here.

About 8 or 10 years ago, it's kind of hard to remember the exact time period now but it was around 2015 to 2019, me and  my brother and my babysitter, we're going for a walk to the park. It was a local park was like 510 minute. Walk and as we get there. I see this man sitting on a bench.  I pay him no attention But as we get close to the bend, she gets up and walks away. Which I think is reasonable because me and my brother are to annoy little brats going to stream and play on the swings, but it was weird because he left the park, but he didn't leave the park. He was still around in the area, so I'm walking around and for some context. We are in the middle of Eastern Canada, summer, 35\u00b0C outside. He is in a full leather trench Coat with a leather cowboy looking hat. When we eventually leave, I see the man not following us but walking in the same direction. I thought he was following us but a lot of people live in that direction. So I just assumed he was walking home and I'm paying more attention to him. My babysitter also starts to seem again. We start to pick up Pace. I seem walk behind a truck. Right outside an old pawn shop that I can see the door distinctly separated away from the truck so he couldn't walk inside.  As he's walking, he walks behind the truck and he doesn't walk away from the truck. He's go across the street to see if he's there. There's nothing he just vanished. Now.

I\u2019m from Victoria, Australia - he was from Queensland but was working in Victoria and was 28 at the time (I was 24). We hit it off and within a day of chatting he asked to meet me in the city for drinks, he seemed friendly and cute so why not get dressed up and give him a chance? Funnily enough my spidey senses were tingling already but I just thought it was usual nerves of a first date. I should have trusted my gut but he hadn\u2019t given me any red flags yet..\nHe met me at Flinders Street Station, first impression was he dressed really nice, suit and long coat, clearly took pride in his looks. Instantly he was super affectionate, way more than I\u2019m used to. He kissed my cheek, picked me up, squeezed the crap of me and we were hand in hand from the get go. Although I was taken aback, he was of Brazilian descent and I know their culture can be quite forward. I wasn\u2019t overly alarmed but this was within 10 seconds of meeting \ud83d\ude05\nSo we decide to go for drinks and he recommends a very well known fancy bar. I\u2019m just a nurse so way above my pay grade but he said would like to cover the whole night. It become apparent very quickly he\u2019s super chivalrous, charming and a sweet talker. It felt like a soppy 2000\u2019s rom com, I can\u2019t lie. \nHe was super open about his life, and because he was, so was I. We had so much in common and everything just felt right. It makes me want to gag now I know the real him\u2026 If it feels too good to be true, it probably is.\nBasically the \u2018life story\u2019 he threw up all over me was that he was born in Brazil, his parents had a family business and were well off but lost it somehow, think he said his dad died, RIP dad. His mum couldn\u2019t afford to care for him and his 4 sisters alone so she gave him up for adoption and he moved to Portugal. I guess he was the runt of the litter because she kept the 4 girls. \nSo he grew up in Portugal from about 5 until he was 17 when he decided to move back to his biological mother. He said his Portuguese family were lovely but incredibly religious and he didn\u2019t like the constraints, arranged marriage, no boinking before marriage type deal. \nSo at 17 he moves back to Brazil and builds his relationship with his biological mother and eventually he decided to move to Australia. He moved over to study some aerodynamic bullshit degree for some career I don\u2019t give a flying fuck about. Fast forward 11 years to 2022 and now he works in Queensland as some manager for shipping companies and flies to and from Melbourne for work every few weeks.\nNow you\u2019re up to speed with that crock of shit, let\u2019s get back to the date. I had a traumatic upbringing (neglect, poverty, raised by grandparents and so on), so hearing all that really touched me, the man had me in the palm of his slimy hands. I felt at times he was cocky and had an ego on him but he even mentioned he can come across cocky and reassured me that\u2019s how some people perceive him but he\u2019s not at all (so clearly someone\u2019s pulled him up for being an arrogant twat before). The date is progressing and we\u2019re having huge dnms, he was ticking so many boxes. \nWe spoke about how I love to dance and always wanted to learn salsa so he suggested a studio that does weekend night classes, but it had sold out. So he asked if I\u2019d go back to his place, just to \u2018hang out\u2019 \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f idk what this man put in my drink (not literally just fyi) but my common sense was gone. I told him I needed to go home before midnight and was only coming over to talk, anyway we get to his apartment and like the scene from \u2018crazy stupid love\u2019 he lights candles, puts on salsa music, pours a heavy glass of red for us and asks if he can teach me how to salsa in his tiny living room. Like, was I Kate Hudson in how to lose a guy in 10 days? \nI oblige because my fanny flutters are in full control of my functioning at this point. We end up making out and things get hot and heavy but I stuck to my guns and didn\u2019t let him past my chastity belt. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I have had one night stands before but I had turned a new leaf and my rule was now 3 dates minimum. Long story short but not short at all, we ended up falling asleep together and I was full clothed, how about that. We woke up the next morning and he took me out for breakfast before ordering me an uber home\u2026 Keep in mind that was the one and only time I physically met him and it was PG rated\u2026\nA few days later things were getting weird. he started making grandiose gestures and love bombing. Without asking he bought me lingerie (he didn\u2019t know my size and had never seen me in lingerie), he bought me jewellery for my birthday just 1 week after we met and then the grand prize - an all inclusive holiday to QUEENSLAND. I said yes because \u2018yolo\u2019, right? Like literally, I might die but at least my tombstone would say I was living my best life. \nHe told me on the trip we\u2019d go to private restaurant his friend owns, a helicopter ride, and a cruise on a yacht, amongst a bunch of other completely insane things. He paid for the flights and told me not to bring lingerie because he had that covered \ud83e\udd2e My red flag alarms were going off at this point, like is he a sugar daddy or am I about to be trafficked in the lingerie and jewellery he just bought me? Think about it\u2026 Dude works for a shipping company, perfect way to ship me off to the market.\nSo at this point my stomach is turning and I\u2019m getting sus. I realised I hadn\u2019t really done much digging on him and if I was going interstate with this schmoozy wet sock I needed to know everything. I spent hours with my housemate investigating. His facebook was on total lockdown (this was before you could lock your profile) and his insta had no signs of family. He barely had any tagged photos with people and the photos he did have were from years ago in Brazil. All the photos he had were just him solo and travelling, so I started questioning everything - was his name even Wilton Wallace??? Doesn\u2019t sound Brazilian or Portuguese, sounds more like Donald Duck or Chucky Cheese to me. \nSo we searched his number on my bank app using PayID, low and behold \u2018W Veiga Dos Santos\u2019 comes up \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f (changed for anonymity) I\u2019m shitting bricks now, like who the fuck is this toenail I\u2019ve been wasting my time with?! So I go deeper, I\u2019m going through all of his insta followers looking for any remanence of him. I find a mutual in the deep dark cave I\u2019ve got myself into and there it is - a group photo of him from around 2016, holding a Brazilian woman that looks about 35 and the comments mention \u2018love you both, can\u2019t wait to see you two again\u2019. Couldn\u2019t confirm if they were married but that\u2019s where my money was\u2026\nI dig more and more to find who she is. I can\u2019t find anything but I had a lead on what her name might be so I head to google and search both her name and his Veiga Dos I\u2019m a fucking liar name\u2026 After sifting through countless pages I can\u2019t read because they\u2019re in Spanish and poorly translated - I find a settlement document. It was a civil dispute about a debt but both their full names were there. To my delight his full name in the case was Wilton Wallace Veiga Dos Santos. I don\u2019t blame him for going by the easiest of the 5 name, but one truth doesn\u2019t fix a truck of lies.\nSo now I\u2019m thinking I\u2019ve gone mad and overthinking, maybe he\u2019s just divorced and doesn\u2019t post a lot?? NOPE. Whilst doing our investigations I asked him to send his passport so my friends had his details \u2018when I went to Queensland\u2019, to be safe. He sends me his passport after hours of waiting and he had blacked out info and covered his face. Dumb fuck didn\u2019t cover his date of birth well enough though because would you look at that - this absolute toad was born in 1986, making him 36! \nNow, I saw through his bullshit but I wanted to flip the game for a little while, I had to do it for the plot. I confronted him about it, he made up some shit about how when he was registered in Portugal they stuffed up the date.. Didn\u2019t know a 5 year old could look 13 but there you have it. Over the next few weeks he kept cancelling and changing Queensland plans days before each rescheduled flight, there was always another issue. I went along with it, I had no intention of going but wanted to see his cunning plot come to fruition.\nMaybe it wasn\u2019t trafficking, maybe he was going to magically lose all his money and get cancer and need my help to survive? And then I get a message that broke the camel\u2019s back - his grandma in Portugal was sick so he had to fly there ASAP. I literally laughed when I read it. I was super short and apathetic with him, next day grandma died of a stroke, boo hoo. \nSome may think my digging went a bit too far at this point but I ended up messaging the woman from the insta photo and legal document because I just had a horrible gut feeling there was more to all of this and I was sick of the games. It definitely felt like I was crossing a line but I had to know. She ended up messaging me back that she unfortunately did know him and wanted to tell me everything over the phone\u2026\nWhat she told me blew my fucking mind. Excuse my language but this C*NT was the biggest narcissistic, pathological lying, cheating scumbag I had ever had the displeasure of knowing.\nHe had lied about it all. He was 36, born and raised by his mum and dad in Brazil his entire life. He had brothers, not 4 sisters. He never lived in Portugal. Grandma was still alive and kicking. He studied social work and was now studing to become a physiotherapist, nothing to do with aerowhatever the fuck. I don\u2019t even know what the shipping container place has to do with any of it (but he\u2019d sent me insta stories of him \u2018working\u2019 there so that\u2019s scary). He was the same charming suave man to his ex wife, who he married in Brazil and they moved to Queensland shortly after. As soon as they arrived he became, financially and emotionally abusive to her and refused to get a job. She worked and paid for the bills, his social work degree, random \u2018business\u2019 trips and whatever else this scumbag pretended he did.\n(Side note, please do not try and find her, she would like to remain anonymous as she is scared of her ex-husband and what he is capable of)\nAfter being in Queensland for 5 years, she got a message from a 24 year old Australian girl. (Same age I was at the time) and it turned out they\u2019d been dating for 3 years. They\u2019d met at uni and he\u2019d been using her to do all his university work. She was told the same life story as me but the poor thing never questioned it, she believed the crap about his age too. \nShe realised through a mutual uni friend that saw a photo of him and said she thought he was married, thank fuck for that friend. So Wilton and his wife get divorced and the 24 year old kicks him to the curb but only a year later, another girl reaches out to his now ex-wife - same story: 24 year old Australian girl, told the same bullshit life story and believed it, they\u2019d been together 4 years and he was using her to pay for his lifestyle and clothes. Two years go by, his ex wife just hoped he had finally come to his senses but afraid not, I was the third girl to reach out to her.\nMy guess is he\u2019s still got a few girls on the go at a time, his plans probably kept changing because of them and one of them probably pays for his plane trips every few weeks. Fuck, the holiday, jewellery and lingerie was probably some other woman\u2019s hard earned money as well.\nNeedless to say I was furious! I ended up ghosting him because that\u2019s the best way to piss of a narcissist. He messaged me for weeks on text, insta, whatsapp and fb. Eventually I decided to give him a taste of his own medicine. I told him I knew some things and he needed to come clean. I never mentioned what or how I knew but he said he\u2019d be fully transparent and fly down to Melbourne to see me. He probably thought I knew 1% of the truth. I thought about actually seeing him and seeing what bullshit he\u2019d come up with next but I was done - \nI told him I was about 5 hours from the city, in a town that\u2019s so small there\u2019s only 1 train to get there a day. I said I couldn\u2019t pick him up from the airport but he could stay a few days, I\u2019d show him the real Australian country and I\u2019d drive him back to the airport at the end of his visit. \nSo after catching 2 and half hour flight and sitting on a train for 5 hours to go to the middle of nowhere I asked him to send a photo of where he was so I could find him\u2026 He\u2019d actually done it \ud83d\ude02 I was at home in my pyjamas watching a movie and he was at a train station in the rain, 5 fucking hours away from the airport and stuck until the next day! Pure gold! I can only imagine how pissed he would have been. I sent him a message I had ready and waiting for that exact moment. I waited for a reply so I knew he got it, then blocked the piece of shit on everything and never looked back.\nSo there ya go. Stay safe out there and always trust your instincts!

It's one of my weirdest and upsetting experiences ever - and I'm a senior citizen now. \nMy parents, especially my mother, fought me tooth and nail and basically helped this guy stalk me! I've never quite figured out why. \"You're making the biggest mistake of your life,\" she sobbed. (No way. Even thinking about him still makes my skin crawl.)\nIt might have been a control thing - \"Ah, she thinks she's going to get away from us. She thinks she's gonna do whatever she wants and we can't do anything about it. Ohoho, well. We're friends with Rich, and after they're married he and we will be taking care of what goes in and out of her head for the rest of her life!\"\nAnyway, here's what happened. I got even by sending him to hell. Etiquette Hell. Here's my story as I posted it there years ago.\nhttps://www.etiquettehell.com/content/eh_everyday/dating/dating.shtml\nThis happened in 1978, but I may never recover. If it had happened in the era of stalker awareness I would have been terrified!\nFirst some back story...I was adopted, which isn't a bad thing, except that my parents had wanted a Perfect Dream, Barbie Doll, Daughter and I was supposed to live out their script. They were very controlling, and coupled with alcohol abuse, by the time I was a teen the breach was so bad I wasn't living in their house most of the time. I'd try to move back and fix things but it never worked. What finally broke my back was a guy I'll call \"Rich.\"\nRich called my house one afternoon and asked for a date. I told him I didn't know him (true) and that I wasn't allowed to date (also true). He seemed annoyed because I didn't know who he was. \"I'm on the student council. I am head of our Junior Achievement Club.\" (Big deal so what.)\nI asked how he got my number because it was unlisted and he said he volunteered in the school office and pulled my number from student records. That should have been my first clue, but remember I was only 15. Any way, I told him no and hung up, thinking this was the end of it.\nThe next day I get home from school and find mom all excited. She's gotten a call from El Creepo AND his mother, and was sooooo impressed that she decided I could go out with him. His mom was going to pick us up and bring me home, so it was okay. I told her I didn't even know the guy, but she thought this was soooo sweet that he had his mother introduce him.\nWe went out for pizza and a movie, and I thought he was a nice enough guy, but I really wasn't interested in him. However, he decided this one date meant I was his girlfriend now. He was aided and abetted in this by my mother, who thought he was \"perfect\" and \"just what we always wanted for you.\"\nExplaining to her that I wasn't interested in him just brought up a monologue about what a great guy he was, what a good family he comes from, why would I rather be home reading a book than out having a good time. (Telling her I didn't have a good time didn't compute in her brain)\nI never got to see my other friends because he was monopolizing all my time. Weekends I had to go to his house for dinner and watch TV. First we watched \"The Love Boat\" then we watched \"Fantasy Island\" and I had to endure his siblings running around the living room flapping their arms and yelling \"the plane the plane\" - (I wish I was making this up.) On Saturday and Sunday we played Atari at his house. At least he had good games. Sunday mornings, as soon as Rich wakes up, he calls me.\nI tried telling him I wasn't interested in a relationship and I didn't want to see him anymore. He started to freaking CRY. I had to shake his hands off me. While I was walking home he called mom in tears \"to tell her goodbye....\" and \"I guess I just didn't love her enough....\" and the psycho blasted me when I walked in the door for being so mean to this sweet guy.\nHe quickly learned the way to force me out on dates was to ask in front of her because she would roll over any excuse I came up with. He began trying to get rid of my friends by complaining that \"they don't like me\" (true) and asked mom to make sure they weren't invited over when he was there. My friends either didn't like him or were a bad influence on me.\nHe griped about my clothes and makeup. He hated lipstick especially. I told my mom, thinking she'd agree how STUPID this was, but when I got dressed for school the next day she blew up. \"What are you doing with that makeup on? Rich told you he doesn't like that! You get in there and wash your face!\" I was flabbergasted, but said hell no to both of then and wore whatever I liked. He'd scowl and screw his face up into the ugliest sneers, saying I \"look like a streetwalker.\" (Over lipstick, eye shadow and mascara!)\n\"A girl your age has no business wearing a bikini. That top is too low-cut. Why don't you show some self-respect?\" (I was the flattest of flat-chested girls!)\nI wish he'd been really abusive, because then my parents would have agreed to get rid of him. But he was an honor student, from a good family, not a troublemaker. At school the teachers liked him and although the other kids thought he was a number one nerd, didn't bully him because he stomped everybody's behind academically. I don't know why he fixated on me, maybe because I was the shyest kid in school. He never hit me or was verbally abusive, I just couldn't peel him off.\nChristmas was the worst. He gave me a list: this is what he wants for Christmas, this is what his sister wants for Christmas, this is what his mother wants for Christmas! He expected me to buy gifts for his family! I wasn't even planning to get him anything, and he wanted an Atari game. We couldn't afford an Atari system for ourselves, but mom of course buys it for him. She gets everything on the list and tells me to hush because they're getting me something too. I asked Rich for a gift certificate to the bookstore but his mom says gift certs are tacky. They will get me a real gift. So I'm thinking something cool.\nHe gets me, I kid you not, a set of lady's handkerchiefs. I saw them 2 for 5 bucks at K-Mart! After he demanded an Atari game! His sister gets me nothing. His mom buys me a football jersey (I am not a football fan) like the one Rich wears. Mom goes ga-ga saying how cute that we'll match, and be sure to wear it next Friday so they'll see how much I like it. I quietly throw it away.\nI blasted my parents for manipulating and interfering and moved out again. They gave Rich my new address and phone number. I moved and changed numbers again and didn't give them the number. He had mom go to one of my friends and wheedle it out of her. I almost got fired from a job because he wouldn't stop calling me. He waited for me outside the door of my work and followed me, begging and crying. He followed another guy I was dating and tried to convince him we were engaged. I called the cops but they said he wasn't breaking any laws and even lectured me for \"not being forceful enough.\"\nSometimes he would disappear for a few months but always turned up again. My roommate came home from work one day to find him mowing the lawn at the duplex we were renting! At this time the word stalking didn't exist, or I would have been terrified.\nThe harassment ended only when I moved out of town!!! I went back for a family funeral and found he had gone to pay respects and introduced himself to everyone as my boyfriend! ICK! I told everyone if they told him where I was living I'd shoot them first and him second!

It's been a weird few weeks, hasn't it? It's been weird for me, at least.\nI came home today and saw, with my own eyes, mechanical drones flying above my neighborhood in Georgia. FAA lights, flying low, unmarked and unseen on my flight radar. While I was a firm believer before in the situation, with all the video evidence floating around here, it's another thing entirely to see the phenomenon happen right before your eyes. I'm not going to bother posting another fuzzy iPhone camera video, there's plenty of those out there already and better.\nThat aside, let's get into the meat of this.\nThe Infamous 4Chan Leak\nI'm sure everyone here has heard of the UFO 4Chan leak, but if you haven't let me catch you up to speed.\nThe Post:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/4chan-whistleblower-NXjWQaN\n(Text Transcription):\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1hfpg0k/since_people_keep_referencing_it_while_talking/?share_id=jt3qzfk2KcJwXWnwoLo0Z&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1\nI cannot and will not summarize the whole thing. Go read it for yourself, it's fascinating.\n...You back yet? Good.\nThe Probes\nFrom here on out, I will be referring to the \"orbs of orange light\" as Probes, because... well, that's what they are. They are cameras equipped with an omnidirectional light source that appears as an orange \"orb\" when in Scanning Mode, and then when in Combat Mode, the light quickly disappears and is replaced with a red light.\nHow do I know this? Well for starters, check this out:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/s/xPsjx3pp35\nThis post depicts a video of two \"Mechanical\" drones (they look like traditional 4-rotor drones, except supersized and equipped with FAA-approved lighting, but do not appear on any radar scanning tech) and one Probe.\nAll is fine, until the Mechanical drones get too close. At that moment, the orb of light rises into the air, retreating from the Mechanical Drones, and the light transforms from a glowing orb of light into two red lights.\nWeird, right?\nUp until now, we have been thinking they are on the same side. They are clearly not.\nThe Hammers\nIf you read the 4Chan post above (which you should have!!!) something in that video should jump out at you immediately: the light transforming into two lights.\nIn the 4Chan leak (which came out BEFORE the current events, in April 2023) the author discusses the Probes briefly, what their purpose is and what they do.\n\"Research/science vessels sometimes have mobile light\u00ad producing \"cameras\" used for multiple purposes from scouting to keeping threats contained or at bay. These are shaped like hammers and when operated are extremely bright. Red lights are a sign of hostility or caution to deploy weapons. Orange lights are usually for spotting minerals or living things.\"\n\nMULTIPLE TIMES, the author of the post states information about the Probes:\n\"Shaped like a hammer but when activated yes they appear like spheres due to the intense light. They see light differently and looking into the sun for them isn't an issue like it is for us. I can't speak for the psionic abilities if any since I've only heard rumors in passing. We believed the lack of communication was inherent to their personal beliefs about us. As mentioned previously but active serious discussion about destruction gets them going.\"\n\n\"Do you mean orbs in the sky? Or do you mean landed craft deploying them? I've mentioned previously that there are tools that are shaped like \"hammers\" They emit extremely bright light and are used as a sort of drone or scout. They are able to view almost 360 degrees and detect everything from minerals to bio. If a human encounters them they usually are deployed to keep watch and figure out when to wrap up and leave.\"\n\nNow, having read that information, go back and watch the video above.\nMy Conclusions\nNow, having laid all that out before you, let me propose my theory on the current situation. This is Speculation, but it is an EXTREMTLY EDUCATED GUESS. I'm not the type of person to just go out on faith just because I \"Want to believe.\" I feel that we already have compelling evidence enough to piece together a story out of this situation.\nNow, here are my thoughts:\n\nNon Human Intelligence is real.\nCurrently, we are in the middle of a global event in which the Non-Human Intelligences are finally revealing themselves to us in a way that is undismissable, unexplainable and unavoidable.\nThe Mechanical Craft we see are the U.S. Government's drones as they scout out and assess the situation. They understand that we are about to witness a global event, and I believe most of the more \"base\" Politicians see this as an existential threat and an \"invasion,\" so they are closely monitoring the situation.\nThe orbs of light that we see are Probes, multipurpose unmanned vessels deployed by NHI ships and the mothership \"factory\" itself, which sits at the bottom of the ocean off the Atlantic Coast. Specifically, in the Bermuda area. The factory attacks anything that gets close, or otherwise flees underwater and disappears for weeks at a time before returning back to it's original spot. It's been here for a while, anywhere from 100 years to a few thousand.\nThere is nothing else we can do but witness what is about to happen.\n\nHappy Trails!\n\"So.... what now?\"\n.... truthfully, I don't know. None of us do, really. This has never happened before in our known history of humanity. I know, I know, ancient aliens and all that, but let's get real: there was never going to be a way to solve this mystery just based on old heiroglyphs, cuniform and religions that have gone through the telephone game so much that I can't even make out the words anymore.\nIf it was ever going to happen, it would happen exactly like this.\nAlright, by for now everyone! Stay safe out there, good luck and remember:\nNo matter what happens next, just take it in stride. We Humans are so strong, so courageous, so adaptible and smart, that we will figure out a way to survive this... mentally, physically and spiritually.\nSee you, Space Cowboy/\n", "media": null, "score": 1113, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "comment_count": 322, "over_18": false}, "47": {"id": "1hg2sgs", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ufos", "stickied": false, "category": "Aliens", "author": "EasilyAmusedEE", "link_flair_text": "Sighting", "time": 1734749903.3130596, "created_utc": 1734410056.0, "url": "https://v.redd.it/pc3ozh4b7c7e1", "title": "12/16 UA2359 ORD to EWR", "permalink": "/r/UFOs/comments/1hg2sgs/1216_ua2359_ord_to_ewr/", "selftext": "Some video clips from my flight to Newark NJ.

We're gonna be alright :)", "permalink": "/r/ufo/comments/1hg52th/psa_do_not_panic_were_gonna_be_alright/", "selftext": "It\u2019s come to my attention as I\u2019ve been researching the current Drone/UAP crisis happening across the planet that there seems to be a deliberate effort by the U.S. Government to hide the truth of what\u2019s happening. The State Government and local officers are assisting as much as they can, but they are vastly unequipped for the current situation.\nHowever, I want to make something clear, because this is my I believe this is the key takeaway of all this: We Must Not Panic.\nNot once, for as often as those drones have flown over our military bases and civilian houses, have these drones attacked or hurt anyone.\nNot once have any of these craft shown signs of ill intent, other than their unexplainable appearance.\nNot only that, but combined with reports of UAP\u2019s shutting down nuclear missiles during crisises, it\u2019s clear to see that whatever these things are don\u2019t mean us any harm. If they did, clearly they would have done something by now. We cannot even damage their vessels.\nSo, after hearing tons of politicians say what they think, seeing the situation unfold for myself, and also as a person who is seeking some sort of solution or truth in this situation, here\u2019s my solemn advice to everyone:\nDont panic! It\u2019s gonna be okay!\nNo matter what way you slice it, whether it\u2019s a secret U.S. program or extraterrestrials (\ud83c\udf0a) visiting Earth, whatever is going on, I am almost entirely certain these drones are not a threat.\nThe only threat we have, however, is fear. Fear that we won\u2019t know what\u2019s coming, fear of the impossibility of the situation, fear of the unknown\u2026 we cannot let this fear and anxiety rule over us in this time of change and crisis! No matter what you believe, make a commitment here and now, before things evolve and change into a less or more drastic situation:\n\nBe good to others during this time of panic. People are scared and upset, and do all kinds of things that hurt others and themselves when they act out of fear. It is not your responsibility to inform everyone of the \"truth,\" only to be there as an anchor when clarity can cut through the confusion.\nAll kinds of people who believe one thing or another are going to be confronted with their worst nightmare: a complete spiritual or belief system breakdown. As someone who has gone through (and is still going through) Christian Deconstruction, I can tell you firsthand it is horrible, heartbreaking and a time of mourning and grief. While you and I may get the opportunity to gloat and tell everyone that we were right along (and darnit, we do deserve to gloat after the years and years of ridicule), we must restrain ourselves and see instead the immense pain and grief that our loved ones and community members will be going through. Be compassionate, be loving, be a light in the darkness.\nThe government will not take a systemic change lying down, nor will other national governments. Be prepared for a time of crisis and tumult as society bends and breaks in accordance with these new worldviews and facts. Do not listen to others who are diminishing the problem, but also do not panic yourself; calmly and efficiently gather what you and your family need to get through 2-4 weeks of no running water or food.\nDo not forget to take time to look at how beautiful the world is. I believe it is why they are here, after all.\n\nSo do yourself, and everyone else, a huge favor: turn on the news, but make sure you chill while you do it.\nStay safe everyone!\n\u2026.\nEDIT:\nThank you all for reading, commenting and engaging with each other through my post. It's been a pleasure to read your comments and share this with you.\nI am going to post one last post for now, and then I am going to step away from the news, reddit and most everything else. I feel that I have seen and read enough to understand the situation, and my mental health tells me it's time to turn off the tv for now.\nI'll link it here when I am done, for whoever wishes to read my thoughts on the situation, what is happening and what we can do about it.\nIn the meantime, thank you all, each and every one of you.

I am a digital journalist, and throughout most of my career, I focused primarily on pop culture for outlets like intomore.com, hiphopdx.com, and post-trash.com. My love for pop culture conspiracy theories and gossip also extends into investigative work, like this piece: I Learned My Hometown, In New Jersey, Welcomed The KKK, for Cracked.com.\u00a0\nAs of late, my most recent investigation has led me to the discovery that New Jersey\u2019s drinking water is and has been incredibly contaminated. While this singular article focuses only on how NJ\u2019s drinking water has been contaminated with PFAs chemicals for over 20 years, a deeper look at the Raritan and Middlesex Water Systems reveals even more possibilities of contamination from fecal bacterias, radioactive radon, disinfection byproducts, and lead.\u00a0\nIn the process of doing research for this article, all the documents utilized were public documents from various government agencies. The more I uncovered about New Jersey\u2019s drinking water, the more I realized that all these agencies involved: the EPA, the NJDEP, the USGS, and more, know fully well just how dangerously contaminated NJ\u2019s tap water is.\nMy initial interest in New Jersey\u2019s water began with a visit to New Brunswick\u2019s Robert Wood Johnson University hospital on March 16th of 2024. I went to the emergency room feeling incredibly ill. While there, they ran multiple tests on me, all of which revealed multiple physical ailments. My glucose levels were 157. My C02 levels were low at 21.1 and my Urinalysis was also incredibly abnormal.\u00a0\nStill, the emergency department transferred me to the basement of the facility for behavioral or mental health services from 3/16-3/18. While in the basement, I was not only consistently denied medical attention while coughing up black mucus, but I also witnessed things like a patient being dragged across the floor and another patient who spoke Spanish and seemed to struggle with schizophrenia but was not given a translator whatsoever. The doctors then forced me to sign myself \u201cvoluntarily\u201d into another facility by saying that if I did not sign the paperwork, they would submit me \u201cinvoluntarily.\u201d\u00a0\nFrom 3/18 \u2013 3/20, I was at Rutgers University Behavioral Health Care in Piscataway.\u00a0\nWhile there, I noticed that the facility got water delivered in containers each day for the patients to drink. Something they most certainly did not do for me in the basement at Robert Wood Johnson. I also got more tests done, which further revealed just how much I needed medical treatment.\u00a0\nIn addition to having the drinking water delivered at University Behavioral Health Care on Rutgers\u2019 Busch Campus, I took note of how they were having the ceiling tiles replaced in empty rooms. I also believe that many of the rooms, mine included, had asbestos ceiling tiles. Upon signing myself out, I straight up told them I was a journalist, that I had suspicions about asbestos and the water, and I also had to write my place of occupation on the sign out form.\u00a0\nI then began to take interest in New Jersey\u2019s drinking water.\nI very quickly realized that ever since my stay at RWJ in March 2024, I have been and was being followed everywhere I went. The more I discovered for my article on the contamination of New Jersey\u2019s drinking water, the more I feared for my life.\u00a0\nPlease help me, I am so scared.\u00a0\nThe full story and all the proof and pictures are on my blog: https://beccabarglowski.wordpress.com/2024/12/14/i-am-an-american-journalist-and-the-government-is-trying-to-kill-me/", "media": null, "score": 3338, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "comment_count": 434, "over_18": false}, "62": {"id": "1hhz1bz", "locked": false, "subreddit": "bigfoot", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "hippy2zippy", "link_flair_text": "encounter story", "time": 1734749919.9097545, "created_utc": 1734631681.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/wpujpz2kiu7e1.jpeg", "title": "1977 News Article ", "permalink": "/r/bigfoot/comments/1hhz1bz/1977_news_article/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 210, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comment_count": 12, "over_18": false}, "63": {"id": "1hh4jpx", "locked": false, "subreddit": "cryptozoology", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "TalonEye53", "link_flair_text": "Question", "time": 1734749920.7977595, "created_utc": 1734537201.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hh4jpx", "title": "What are the chances of these guys ever to be found?

It happened to me yesterday late in the afternoon. I had just finished buying some snacks from the gas station when a man approached me as I was walking home. It was dark out so the only thing I could make out was that he was about two inches taller than me, had a green jacket with a hood on, and had fair skin.\nHe asks me what's in my backpack. I try walking away but he grabs my bag and refuses to let me go. He demands I hand him the bag. I tried my best to plead with him, saying that he could have the food inside it of he was hungry. He didn't care. He kept fighting me for the bag. I did my best holding my ground and putting up a fight. Several drivers sped past me and none of them bothered to stop and help me. I was all alone on a dark and empty sidewalk. This gas station was in a pretty ghetto part of town. Bunch of drug addicts and violent people. I used to lived there so I knew that cops were regularly called into that neighborhood. I'm glad I managed to escape that environment 2 years ago.\nEventually, the man removes his hand from his pocket and I start fearing for the worst. I almost expected him to pull out a knife but thankfully it was only his fist. He begins banging hard against my fists to the point to they bleed. I couldn't take it anymore so I handed him the bag and watched him run off. There was only some chips and juice in there so it's not like I lost anything super valuable.\nI walked through entire way home constantly looking over my shoulder in case that bastard came back for more. I didn't call the police because I knew nothing would be done about it. I barely even had a description of the guy so they wouldn't really have anything to go off of. I'm currently at work with a bandaged hand, trying my best to get through the day despite the pain. I hope the guy who did all this ends up messing with the wrong person and gets the hell beaten out of him. I wish I never went to that neighborhood.
