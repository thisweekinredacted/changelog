We dispatched all law, fire, ems for the entire county, and within this county were multiple law agencies. \nI had been there for about three months or so when I met him. Let\u2019s call him Jake. Jake had recently transferred from a big department in California and landed himself randomly at our department. It didn\u2019t make much sense as to why he left California in the first place, but he always insisted it was just time for him to move to a smaller/less dangerous department. \nHim and I quickly became close and would chat almost every day after I got off shift. Within a few months it became apparent that we liked each other and our flirting progressed into something more serious. \nFast forward a few months later and it turns out he was doing some inappropriate things to photos/videos of me whilst he was actively on duty. This and a few other things he had kept hidden on duty lead to him losing his license and leaving. \nDuring the process of his termination, his sgt had suggested I get a protective order against him as he had made threatening statements previously towards me (such as \u201cyou better be telling the truth, I\u2019ll find out on Tuesday if you\u2019re lying to me, etc\u201d). I had began to fill out the paperwork and was told I had a temporary protective order on him in the meantime, but don\u2019t think I ever did. \nAbout two weeks after his termination, he calls me to catch up. The entire call is like an old friend to an old friend. What am I doing for work? Do I have a boyfriend now? But progressively turns more personal\u2026 When does my shift end? What do I drive? Being 18 and naive, I treated him like I always had, answering his questions. \nI had contacted his old department afterwards, as his sgt had told me to let him know if I was ever contacted again, but they turned me away pretty quickly & didn\u2019t want anything to do with it. With that, I blocked Jake.\nRoughly a month later, I get a call from a new number and it\u2019s Jake. Once again, he wants to meet up & catch up. But this time he so casually goes on to tell me about this new house he\u2019s wanting to buy in my neighborhood...knowing it\u2019s my neighborhood.  I had never told him where I lived in town, let alone what specific neighborhood. \nDuring this call he progressively got more aggressive as well, making statements such as \u201cif I knew I was going to get canned, I should have just had my way with you.\u201d He halfheartedly joked about getting a hotel room just for me, and that was that.\nA few days later he FaceTimed me, & once again came off as simply wanting to catch up as he was sick. Midway through our seemingly normal conversation, he makes it apparent he\u2019s been touching himself this entire time. Keep in mind, nothing suggestive was mentioned and our conversation at that point was about his new dog. \nHe\u2019s blocked once again but has tried to follow my social media & now I\u2019ve started to see him in my area.

Thought I'd share one of them here, albeit I haven't tried it myself since... I don't really want to open myself up to anything odd.\nTo do this all you need is to find a mushroom circle, but it helps if you also have some sort of non-silver gift. When you find the circle just sit in it and chant 'I wish to go to land of fae, I wish to be whisked away' and then... wait. Things should shift a bit, like the woods around gains life. The leaves should be greener, the air fresher, sun brighter, that's when you know it's worked.\nBefore long (I've heard people say anywhere from 5 to 60 minutes) you should meet your supposed 'fairy', my friends have different descriptions but the consensus seems to be a small person with wings. Most likely they'll be curious and chatty, but sometimes it takes the aforementioned gift being offered to make them hang around and want to talk. There's not too much to it beyond just that, you get to say you met a fairy and talked with them.\nWhen you want to head back you can just politely tell them goodbye and then chant 'I wish to return to home, to a bed that's nice and warm' and things should shift back to normal, if not then wait a bit and repeat it. Make sure things are normal before you leave the circle, since that's the clear sign you're... y'know, back.\nI have heard a couple warnings be given, such as not revealing your real name to the fairy and not offering a gift with silver. They apparently don't like it much. There's also a rare case where when trying to meet the fairy the forest around gets darker and more ominous, one of my friends said it happened to them. They just did the chant to go home after they felt like they were being watched, but it's a reason why I don't even want to try tbh.\nI think that covers most of what I know, if anyone has questions then I can try and ask my friends to see if they know though.", "media": null, "score": 15, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "comment_count": 10, "over_18": false}, "15": {"id": "18u8iee", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ghosts", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Own_Issue_5701", "link_flair_text": "Personal Encounter ", "time": 1704519815.8676677, "created_utc": 1703915921.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/t8rk1opugd9c1.jpeg", "title": "So My Fiance And I Had To Feed The Neighbors Cat And This Is What We Walk Up On", "permalink": "/r/Ghosts/comments/18u8iee/so_my_fiance_and_i_had_to_feed_the_neighbors_cat/", "selftext": "So I immediately ask my fiance do you think that's a real person or what ?

In a clearing, dos Santos saw an object descending towards the ground. The witness approached to within 180 meters and noticed that the object was shaped like a \u201ctelephone booth\u201d about 1 meter \u00bd in height. Apparently the witness had been carrying his camera with him and was able to snap a picture of the object, which suddenly disappeared in plain sight. He walked over to where the craft had been and suddenly saw another object descend.\nThis other object was shaped like a toy top a little larger than the previous object and with a small propeller like apparatus on top and a long pointy protrusion on its bottom. As the witness stood attempting to photograph this second object, he heard a whooshing sound and the craft was suddenly enveloped in smoke. Approaching closer to the smoke, he noticed yet another craft descending overhead, it was a 1-meter tall barrel shaped craft that balanced itself above the ground then landed. It had a large propeller at one end and was covered with red stripes.\n\u200b\nThe crafts.\nAfter walking for about 10 meters towards the object, this one suddenly vanished and he saw a huge egg-shaped, white colored object descend to the ground. The egg-shaped craft had a pointy top and fin-like protrusions on each side. Next to the fins the witness could see several windows. As it descended it emitted a horrible noise resembling a choking motor, and it projected four leg-like landing pods. As the witness approached and attempted to photograph the object, there was a sudden flash that temporarily blinded him, irritating his eyes. Frightened, the witness dropped the camera and ran, but after about ten meters he suddenly stops, unable to move anymore, he felt as if someone was grabbing him from behind. As he looked behind him, he noticed two men wearing helmets with visors and gloves. Behind the glass visor he could see human faces. They grabbed the witness, each grabbing one arm.\nHe begged them to let him go in the name of God, but he received the following answer, \u201cIn the name of God, we are all brothers. We don\u2019t harm anybody.\u201d The voice seemed to originate from a box like apparatus on their backs. He was taken towards the landed object. As he neared it, he felt an intense cold around it. Another helmeted figure stood by a ladder from the craft, looking from side to side, apparently on guard duty. The man asked dos Santos if he had seen something that sounded to the witness like a \u201cZurca,\u201d which he thought it could have been one of the previous smaller objects. The man than extended his gloved hand and pulled the witness inside the craft through a square door.\nInside the craft, the atmosphere was pleasant and cool and there was a smell of \u201cbaby powder\u201d in the air. There were other men sitting around on seats in the room. He described the humanoids as man-like, wearing dark, tight-fitting outfits. The men had large slanted eyes, thin noses, and large mouths and they seemed to be operating some type of unknown machinery. The men suddenly stood up and began conversing among themselves in an unknown language. Suddenly from out another room, a heavyset woman came out, she wore a white uniform with gloves but no helmet. The witness described her as good looking, tanned, with long light fine hair. The woman and one of the men then took him into a corridor.\n\u200b\nThe beings and the interior of the craft.\nHe then entered a room where he saw a square shape object in the middle. The man pushed a button on the wall and the object rose up. The object resembled a large piece of marble. The woman then took out a long, wand-like device and pointed it at the object. On the object the witness then saw an image of the planet Earth and other planets. At this point the man then removed his helmet and the witness could see that he had very short, light-colored hair. When the witness exited the object, he was told to cover his eyes and not to look as the object left. He did as instructed and did not see the object depart.\n\u200b\nSource:\n\"Humanoid Encounters 1975-1979: The Others amongst Us\" by Albert S.

I had this experience at my job as a lifeguard where I had two teenagers literally tell me i was wrong about something I've been warned about by my dad who was teaching me the practices of a medicine man.\nThey were basically saying that one of their friends was a skinwalker. I said he couldn't be. He would be a wendigo the terms can't be used interchangeably. I was just trying to educate them since Wendigos are a part of my tribes beliefs. We believe in skinwalkers as people who practice bad medicine but we don't call them that. We still don't invoke their name though as what we really call them.\nFor context, I'm from a tribe in Canada and now live down in the states. My father is practicing to be a medicine man and would teach me as well. He is from a tribe even farther up north. He'd also bring me to gatherings of tribes. We'd also go to pow-wows and we'd spend time with other people from other tribes who were practicing good medicine. The elders of other tribes would also tell stories of warnings about bad medicine men. Some from Navajo tribes.\nSo it's frustrating when people with no knowledge of our lively hoods explain our own beliefs and culture to us. I was trying to correct them. As I explained the difference they decided it was more fun to ignore the fact they were making fun of my culture and dismissing my beliefs.\nIt's also really angers me since they're speaking over and writing over a culture that isn't theirs that they do not practice. That their ancestors almost killed and we have been working hard to keep our beliefs and culture alive. The spreading of misinformation is very frustrating. I even tried to explain this to them and they still decided that their fun was more important. One even said that he was a eighth native. I honestly don't mind when a person who is not completely native or even not native at all tries to learn our practices and beliefs to understand. I believe it's not okay for them to trample over the knowledge that we have or use their bit of blood to say they are correct about our beliefs when they don't know or aren't seeking to keep our heritage alive.\nI'm not saying that it's these kids fault. They are just kids but I think that the horror community on tiktok reddit and YouTube really need to do better. Movie companies shouldn't smack a label on things that aren't accurate when they could just call their monster something else. Creators on YouTube and Reddit and tiktok need to make sure that if they are being corrected has verifiable knowledge from the culture not just Google searches. Horror writers also should make sure that if they're writing about these that they are making sure they go by our actual beliefs. There is a new creature that was created online that is very similar call it that type of creature (a fleshgait) because that's able to be edited without adding fiction to real beliefs. That or create a new creature that is similar but add whatever you like but don't call it a wendigo or a skinwalker. The fact that these two things are something truly believed in as more than just a scary campfire story.

So close in fact that my aunt, her wife, and my cousins are only a 10 minute walk from my house, granted, we are very spaced out and borderline rural despite living about 15 minutes from the outskirts of a big city. \nI was walking my two little dachsunds back home from my aunts house- my mom hates it when I'm alone the majority of the day so I spend time at their house, and I was genuinely enjoying my time. It was cold but quiet and oddly beautiful. I got home, fed my pups and two birds, and facetimed a friend. I was talking with them and doing chores, and was admittedly being loud and giggly when taking out the trash to the cans on the side of my house. \nI get back inside, and lay down in bed still chatting, when my bird starts calling at something. Now, anyone who has owned a parrot knows that they have distinct noises for certain moments. She has been in my family for 76 years, and with me my whole life, so I knew the sound was alarm/intrigue. I brush it off as her seeing herself in the window reflection and go back to talking to my friend. \nI get up to get water, and my back is to the sliding Glass door (thankfully locked), and my friend has the wind knocked out of him. I'm confused, and think he's hurt. He tells me, \"Nastya, go back to your room, NOW\". I scoff, but then I see it in my camera view. There is a man with his face and hands pressed up against the glass door. He's a middle aged white guy in a grey pullover and dark pants, and a grin on his face. My friend, ever the best in panicked situations, tells me \"don't look at him, just go to your room.\" I was shaking so hard. I'm blubbering and decide to lock me and my dogs in my closet. My parrot is still going crazy. English isn't my first langauge, and it's bad when I'm shocked, so I revert back to my native language, which he doesn't know.  Luckily, my friend knows to take charge and he tells me he'll be over in 10, and he calls the police . I'm thinking I can run to my mom's room and find the gun, so if the guy comes in the house I can blow a quarter sized whole in his chest. I'm debating getting up when I hear TAPPING ON MY WINDOW. It's slow and intentionally creepy, and my stupid dogs start barking. I'm ready to accept my death. I am a teenage girl, home alone, and I am about to die. Wait... my aunt should about to be leaving for work. I shoot her a quick text. \n< Emmy da ist ein man an meinem fenster bitte hilf mir  >\nThe tapping has stopped and I think it's over when I realize something that makes my balls drop into my chest. I left the front door unlocked when I took out the trash. This keeps getting worse and I beg my friend to hurry.  The tapping thankfully returns to My window and I can only close my eyes and hope that someone gets here fast. It feels like an eternity, crying to another teen who's breaking multiple traffic laws\nNever before have I been grateful to hear another man's voice yelling outside my house at 1 AM. It was my godsent neighbor. Apparently, his pregnant wife was having bad nausea and went out on the deck, and where its situated, you can see my whole back yard. She got a bad feeling after seeing the unfamiliar man approach my door and woke her husband to check it out. I'll thank god everyday for her, because I think she saved my life. I let my neighbors into my house, and my aunt comes about 4 minutes later packing major heat, my friend not long after her. I go from home alone to an impromtu house party of concerned people.  The police come like 10 minutes later like they didn't just take 30 minutes to arrive to the scene. (What the freak? is this normal?)

Last year, I transferred with my company to take a new position in a major Midwestern city. My spouse was still working and living back in California for the next few months. So, I rented a studio apartment for myself in a newly renovated apartment building in a popular downtown neighborhood until we could look for a place together. The apartment was small but nice. It was in a secure building with interior hallways and a nice downstairs lobby. I was one of the first tenants to move into this newly renovated building and other new residents soon started moving in. A major advantage of this move was that I\u2019d only be a couple of hours drive from my hometown and my parents. \nI started my new job and everything was going great. I was enjoying my new neighborhood and the neighbors in the apartment building generally kept to themselves like I did. Then, a new guy moved in across the hall and everything changed. We\u2019ll call him David. David was a single man in his 60\u2019s and was very different from the college students and young professionals who lived in our building. I started noticing his erratic behavior almost immediately. I would come home from work and he would be sitting in his car in our small parking lot just staring off in the distance. We were having issues that summer with smoke clouds coming over from the vast Canadian wildfires. They were leaving a light dusting of ash on our cars similar to pollen. David was convinced that someone was spraying this dust on his car and was accusing various tenants he would run into in the parking lot. He would hoard trash in his apartment and leave trash bags in the hallway causing a foul odor. He would also be yelling to himself in the hallway. I finally had enough and complained to the leasing office. The manager was quick to dismiss my concerns, saying that she\u2019d been in his apartment and everything was fine. \nIn August, my parents 50th anniversary was coming up and I was excited to go home and spend a weekend with them. A few days before their anniversary, my boss informed me that he would be flying in to work on an important project with me that would have us working through the weekend. I was really disappointed and felt like I was letting my parents down. But, I managed to get away for a quick overnight trip in the middle of the week to see them and get back before my boss was due to arrive. I drove down and spent the night with them. The next morning, I checked my email as I was getting ready to head back. There was an email from my apartment manager in regard to the \u201cincident\u201d the night before. The email was very vague, but it stated that a resident was dead and there would be further details coming later. My heart sank and I immediately went pale. My mind instinctively went to my strange neighbor David. \nI opened up a local news app for my city and the top story was about an active shooter in my apartment building who was killed during a SWAT Team standoff the night before. Apparently David approached my next door neighbor in the hallway with a gun and threatened to shoot him. The neighbor ran into his apartment and called 911. David also called 911 and told the dispatcher that his neighbors were hacking his phone and if the police didn\u2019t come he was going to start shooting people. The police came and tried to talk to David. But he had barricaded himself in his apartment and claimed to be heavily armed. The state police and the SWAT Team soon arrived and David began firing a rifle out his window at anyone he saw in the parking lot below. All of the neighbors on my floor were trapped in their apartments with no way of escape. They had to get down and barricade themselves from the gunfire. \nThere was another building across the street with a direct line of sight into our apartment building. A police sniper took a position in the building across the street and shot David through his window. Then they flew a drone into his open window and confirmed that he was dead with a gun still in his hand. Luckily no one else was injured. \nI got home later that day to a bullet riddled apartment building and several neighbors who normally didn\u2019t speak to each other were hugging and crying and showing each other videos of the incident from their hiding places. I\u2019ve never been so lucky to have been out of town. If my boss hadn\u2019t messed up my plans, I would have been home that night. I\u2019m sorry David didn\u2019t get the mental health attention he needed, but he put so many lives in danger.", "media": null, "score": 128, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "comment_count": 8, "over_18": true}, "45": {"id": "18ve00i", "locked": false, "subreddit": "truecreepy", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Great-Appearance1979", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1704519835.958958, "created_utc": 1704047811.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truecreepy/comments/18ve00i/new_year_wish/", "title": "New year wish", "permalink": "/r/truecreepy/comments/18ve00i/new_year_wish/", "selftext": "I wrote mesage in my story wishing happy new year to my facebook friends.

A few nights ago we took our off road vehicle into a nearby forest that we\u2019ve been in many times day / night. We parked up and walked across a bridge to other side of the woods which are surrounded by mounds (probably old war trenches).\nFirst thing I notice is the complete silence, the only sound was the crunching of dead leaves as we walked. Second thing I notice: all of the grassy plants / shrubs on the ground had been crushed and were facing the same direction, as if a herd of buffalo came down from the mounds and trampled them. As we\u2019re walking closer to the mounds, suddenly we hear this heavy thud on the ground -5 meters away towards the mounds- like a 60 kg weight just landed. We don\u2019t see or hear anything else.\nWe decide to go back to the bridge, which is 20 meters away. When we get there- still on the side of the mounds- we stop and shine our flashlights at the forest, we don\u2019t see or hear anything. About 30 seconds later we begin to cross the bridge still with our flashlights pointed at the forest, but now in a bush about 3 meters away are two sets of round, yellow eyes staring at us. The first set of eyes is 1.5-2 meters from the ground and the other set is about 1 meter. We had just shined our flashlights in that exact spot and were still in earshot of this bush, how did this thing move so quickly without making  noise?\nWe walked the rest of the bridge backwards while shining lights at this bush -whole time these eyes are watching us- jumped into the vehicle and gtfo. Luckily it didn\u2019t follow us. Whatever this was stopped, stared, and stayed behind the bushes on the other side of the bridge. I can\u2019t tell if it was 'after us\u2019 or if it was just making sure we left it\u2019s side of the bridge.\nWe went back yesterday in the daylight, there were no animal prints near that bush and no signs of disturbance, although we did find some animal bones on top of the mounds.

I had just experienced a terrible break up, and I started receiving these disturbing phone calls. It started simple. The first call I answered and the person on the other end said how much they missed me. Now, I have a very small circle of friends, and I am not on Facebook or any social site where I update my photos or daily activities. This is important. And I know that the ex I just split up with had nothing to do with the following. Apologies it\u2019s not short. \nThe first call like I said was simple. They said they missed me. I asked who it was and they said it\u2019s me, don\u2019t you remember! So I hung up\u2026 and they immediately called back. Crying, upset that I was, \u201cbeing mean\u201d the caller was clearly an adult male, but they were talking as though they were a very young child (around 6) I hung up again and they didn\u2019t call back. Looking back, I should have blocked the number but as I mentioned I just got blindsided by a break up and wasn\u2019t thinking very well. \nThen they kept calling. They would call, and if I didn\u2019t answer they left messages. Saying how pretty I looked with my blue sweater that day. Or that they knew how I took my coffee now and said they would remember it for when we finally went out for a drink together. I blocked the numbers, they would call from another. I answered one day, yelling at them to leave me alone and hung up again. When they called back, it wasn\u2019t the \u201cboy\u201d but his \u201cmother\u201d\nShe was very upset, said I was hurting her boy by not wanting to play and you could very clearly hear the \u201cboy\u201d crying and screaming in the background. At this point it dawned on me that this wasn\u2019t a joke, prank or something. There was something seriously wrong with these people. And they were obviously watching me. \nFor a few weeks following my break up I had to live in my car. The entire time, I hardly slept. I was terrified thinking I would wake up one day and see him standing outside one of my windows. When I finally got a place, he called to congratulate me and he couldn\u2019t wait to come and play. \nI haven\u2019t heard from the people for a year now but I checked my phone after a very busy work day and noticed 10 missed calls and I\u2019m terrified to check my voicemail\nI\u2019ve reached out to cops but they won\u2019t do anything since I haven\u2019t been \u201cexplicitly threatened\u201d and have been advised to just block calls. I\u2019m going to change my number but I\u2019m terrified that the calls will continue even after that.

Each of these coveted treasures can be obtained through a mysterious and unearthly journey-one that traverses the cryptic dimensions of the Sisters of The Vale. Let me guide you through this arcane path, intertwined with an ancient radio ritual, offering these alluring prizes but at a cost shrouded in enigmatic dread. Are you ready to venture into this realm?\nTo perform this Ritual, you'll need to start by acquiring an analogue radio. This aged device serves as your portal-a link to the hidden dimensions beyond our own. Its analogue frequency tuner is the key to unlocking the elusive pathways that lead to the mysterious realm of the Sisters of The Vale. Once you've obtained this historic instrument, make sure it's ready for the next crucial steps in the ritual.\nTo proceed, ensure the radio can tune down to 70.2 AM and has a headphone jack port. These features are crucial for your journey ahead. They play a vital role, allowing you to connect with the hidden signals that link our world to the mysterious domain of the Sisters of The Vale.\nOnce you have an analogue radio with the necessary features, your next step involves setting the stage for the ritual. Find a secluded spot where external disturbances are minimal. This must occur at precisely 2 am on ANY Friday the 13th of the year. This timing is crucial for the ritual's success, as it enhances your focus and connection with the ethereal frequencies awaiting your reception.\nNow you must tune your radio to 70.2 AM and endure the dissonant static for a gruelling hour and 15 minutes without falling asleep or removing the headphones. This endurance is the threshold, the key to opening the door to the elusive realm of the Sisters of The Vale. If you persist through this prolonged duration amid the static's eerie cadence, you'll gradually perceive faint whispers emerging from the noise. This signifies the progression of the ritual, signalling your impending transition into the mysterious realm of the Sisters of The Vale.\nUpon awakening within the vast chamber, an overwhelming sense of dread takes hold as the 70 Sisters of The Vale loom before you. These spectral entities exude an unmistakable malevolence, their very presence dripping with an aura of ominous intent. Each Sister's form is a grotesque blend of the spectral and the horrifying, their visages twisted into nightmarish masks of terror. Their piercing gazes, cold and unrelenting, bear down upon you, instilling a primal fear reminiscent of facing unspeakable horrors. As they motion toward the trio of doors, a bone-chilling realization sets in-this marks the commencement of a harrowing and perilous journey through this foreboding and malevolent realm.\nLed by the foreboding Sisters of The Vale, you stand before three doors, each pulsating with an aura of its own. The first door appears unassuming, its surface devoid of any distinctive features, yet a palpable air of emotional turmoil emanates from beyond. The second door, weathered and ancient, exudes a chilling sensation, hinting at unseen horrors lingering within its confines. However, it's the third door that sends shivers down your spine-an infernal gateway emanating an aura of impending doom, its very presence foretelling unfathomable trials.\nThe Sisters, their malevolent presence looming, await your choice. The unassuming first door promises 70 years of condensed life experiences, an amalgamation of wisdom and insight beyond measure. The second door, weathered by time, grants a glimpse into your own future, allowing you to peer 70 years ahead, unveiling the secrets of your destiny. As for the ominous third door, it tempts with the allure of unparalleled fame and riches that exceed the boundaries of imagination-a wealth beyond measure, promising a life of fame and wealth that spans beyond 70 lifetimes.\nWith your decision imminent, the Sisters of The Vale stand silently, their haunting gazes fixed upon you as you prepare to step into the unknown, embarking on a journey that defies the bounds of sanity and fortitude.\nBeyond the chosen door lies a seemingly infinite expanse, a room without walls, where the floor stretches into a perplexing void. At its centre stand two doorways, imposing and foreboding, each without handles, seemingly melded seamlessly into the floor.\nThe first door, crafted from a dark, pulsating flesh-like material, radiates an eerie warmth. At its base rests a beating human heart, suspended in an ethereal glow, throbbing in a hypnotic cadence, seemingly synchronised with the very rhythm of life.\nContrastingly, the second door bears a cold, metallic sheen, etched with arcane symbols that shimmer faintly in an iridescent glow. At its base lies a human brain, pulsating with an otherworldly luminescence, each rhythmic throb echoing in unsettling synchronisation with the heart nearby.\nThese doors pose a harrowing choice, transcending the ordinary-a choice between the emotional and vital essence represented by the heart, promising devastating emotional ruin, or the cerebral essence embodied by the brain, threatening to drive you beyond the brink of sanity.\nOnce you've made your fateful choice between the doors, take a decisive step forward and firmly stamp upon the chosen organ, symbolising the destruction of your own essence. As your foot connects with the pulsating flesh or brain, a chilling resonance echoes through the room, and the door you've selected begins to open.\nWithin the chosen door lies an infinite corridor, seemingly stretching into eternity, its walls seemingly composed of a flesh-like, shifting substance, a faint iridescence flickering along its edges. Rows of doors line the passage, a dim glow emanating from the numerals etched upon the them. Each numeral flickers akin to the wavering flame of a candle, casting a faint, intermittent illumination upon the corridor's eerie expanse. Strangely, progress here isn't measured by distance traversed but by the passage of time-one year precisely. It's a year of unending emotional or mental turmoil, an agonizing journey through amplified memories of the hurt inflicted upon and by those closest to you.\nThis desolate passage becomes your solitary abode for the year, an isolated trek through haunting echoes of past grievances. Each step forward signifies a relentless confrontation with emotional scars or mental trials, with only one of the Sisters of The Vale as your spectral companion. Their presence serves as a reminder, a haunting spectre that looms nearby, observing your struggles within this agonizing solitude.\nAs you traverse this desolate corridor, every step forward plunges you deeper into emotional torment or mental anguish. Along this lonely path, the Sister of The Vale, your spectral companion, becomes a harbinger of punishment, delivering retribution for each perceived misstep. Her unseen hands leave scratches upon your skin, traces of her ethereal presence etched in faint, ghostly patterns. At times, her presence manifests in chilling bites that seem to pierce the very fabric of your emotional well-being,  or inflicts wounds upon your psyche.\nWith every stride forward, the corridor's atmosphere grows increasingly oppressive. The weight of your emotional or mental burden feels magnified, it is as if an unseen force anchors your feet, impeding your progress. The Sister's spectral influence extends further, her power seemingly stripping away one of your senses, leaving you disoriented and vulnerable within this haunting expanse. Each punishment inflicted serves as a relentless reminder of your isolation and the spectre's dominion over this realm of trials and tribulations.\nAs you stand at this crucial juncture, the choice before you carries an ominous weight. Before the spectral table lies the flesh-like pill, an object that defies comprehension. It wriggles and pulsates, exuding an eerie darkness. The pill's surface, a twisted amalgamation of fleshy material, appears almost alive, its irregular contours undulating with an otherworldly rhythm. Within its pulsating mass, faint veins seem to flicker the strange darkness intermittently, casting an unsettling shadow upon the spectral table.\nThe pill's unsettling appearance sends shivers down your spine, an uncanny semblance that resonates with the realm's grotesque aesthetic. Its very essence seems to mirror the torment and trials you've faced, a physical manifestation of the anguish that permeates this eerie domain. This unnerving spectacle further complicates your choice, amplifying the tension as you weigh the consequences of ending your nightmare or delving deeper into the unknown horrors that lie beyond the next door.\nShould you opt to consume this fleshy pill and end your ordeal, understand this: you won't wake up in your world, nor in any other. Your soul will cease to exist, departing this spectral realm and leaving behind your physical body in the real world-a mere empty vessel, devoid of its animating essence.\nIf you choose to continue, the path unfolds into another corridor, stretching endlessly before you. For another year, you navigate this desolate expanse, accompanied by a different Sister of The Vale than the last. The emotional or mental turmoil intensifies, inflicting upon you a torrent of amplified anguish and torment, surpassing the trials of your previous ordeal.\nEach step forward feels heavier than the last, burdened by the weight of accumulated trials. The Sister's spectral presence looms, her demeanour reflecting an even more sinister and malevolent essence than her predecessor. Her influence seems to magnify the depths of your emotional scars or mental tribulations, rendering this leg of the journey even more harrowing and unforgiving than the last.\nWith the passage of time, the corridor stretches endlessly, marking another year of trials within this spectral domain. The Sister's spectral form becomes an ever-present tormenter, a haunting silhouette that embodies malevolence and unearthly terror. Her influence, more pervasive than before, seems to twist and distort the very fabric of your emotions and thoughts, plunging you deeper into an abyss of amplified suffering and despair.\nIn this relentless odyssey, the physical pain inflicted upon you by this sister, surpasses that of the previous trial. Each agonizing moment feels like an escalation of torment, an ever-mounting anguish that stretches the boundaries of endurance. The Sister's relentless presence adds a layer of excruciating physical torment to the already unbearable emotional and mental tribulations, pushing you to the brink of your physical and spiritual resilience within this tortuous realm.\nAnd should you make it to the end of this corridor in a year's time, another daunting prospect awaits. At the corridor's conclusion, you'll be faced with yet another spectral table. Upon it rests another flesh-like pill, eerily reminiscent of the one encountered before, and a new door, an invitation to confront further unknown horrors.\nThis time-worn cycle of torment seems to persist, offering the option of either consuming the horrifying-looking pill, ending this ongoing nightmare, or venturing through the ominous threshold of the new door, delving into uncharted depths of emotional and mental tribulations that lie beyond. \nThis relentless cycle of torment, spanning across 70 agonizing years, seems to amplify with each passing corridor. The Sister of The Vale, an ever-ominous presence, stands as a sentinel of spectral agony, each iteration surpassing the previous in malevolence and despair. With every new door crossed, the trials grow darker, delving into abysses of suffering yet unseen, an unending cascade of escalating torment that relentlessly tests the boundaries of one's resilience and fortitude within this nightmare.\nIf you manage to endure and reach the end of this gruelling 70-year ordeal, the toll on your being will be immense-physically aged and emotionally or mentally shattered. Beyond the final door lies the outside world, but your journey is far from over. You're tasked with dragging your weathered and battered body across the desolate expanse of Raven's Rock island.\nThe island is besieged by relentless gale force winds and unyielding torrents of rain. Your path leads you through the perilous Whispering Woods, a foreboding place where even the bravest hesitate to linger. Legends tell of people vanishing in these woods at night, their fate swallowed by the eerie whispers and unknown terrors that haunt this cursed domain.\nYour only chance at survival demands unwavering resolve-you must press onward without pause, for stopping means risking the same fate that has befallen others in these haunted woods. The journey ahead, through the relentless elements and haunting woods, is a treacherous gauntlet that demands sheer determination and an unyielding will to overcome the unknown perils that lie ahead.\nAfter traversing the Whispering Woods and enduring the daunting journey through the island's hostile terrain, your path ascends to the towering summit of a mountain. At its pinnacle stands a solitary shack, weathered and worn by time. As you step inside, you find yourself in the island's radio station.\nHere, amidst the relics of broadcast equipment, you're compelled to tune into the station's frequency-70.2 AM. As the analogue radio emits its familiar static, you sit and endure the white noise for an hour, enveloped in a haunting silence. Gradually, whispers permeate the static, a haunting echo that resonates through the air. The whispers grow louder and more distinct until they engulf your senses, lulling you into unconsciousness.\nWhen you awaken, it's not within the spectral realm or the haunting island but back in the familiarity of your own home. Astonishingly, you find yourself 70 years younger, a physical embodiment of your former self, yet burdened with the weight of accumulated turmoil and trials endured within that spectral nightmare. You're granted a second chance at life, but the haunting memories and emotional scars of the harrowing journey remain etched within your being, a reminder of the unimaginable trials you braved within the spectral depths.\nThe reward you receive upon awakening from this harrowing ordeal hinges on the initial door you chose within that haunting realm. If you entered the first door, you'll gain 70 years' worth of life experience condensed into moments. Opting for the second door unveils a glimpse of your future for the next 70 years. Choosing the third door brings fame and unimaginable riches.\nHowever, a grave warning lingers: should you attempt to re-enter this realm once more, dire consequences await. If the Sisters of The Vale recognize your return, you risk a fate beyond reckoning. Remembered by these enigmatic beings, you'll face a terrifying transformation, reduced to nothing more than a heart and a brain, sitting at the foot of a door.", "media": null, "score": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "comment_count": 5, "over_18": false}, "62": {"id": "18vmjd3", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ghosts", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Embarrassed_Sort5377", "link_flair_text": "Personal Encounter ", "time": 1704519848.805055, "created_utc": 1704074189.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/18vmjd3/i_was_warned_but_i_forgot_my_work_as_a_security/", "title": "I was warned but I forgot.

So here is another one.\nI worked a while in security and always heard my colleages talk about a haunted school. \nThis was the one school that litterally everyone hated to go to because of the creepy stuff happening there.\nSo I started asking questions but people just answered in short phrases like: dude, its just really frking haunted in there. And: you\"ll see what we mean once you get an alarm there.\nSo actually a year goes by and I kinda forgot what school they meant. \nAround 1 am the fire alarm triggers falsely in the school (wich is pretty common). I head over there and turn off the alarm system and go check the firesystem. \nIt was a mechanicall error. \nSo usual protocol is where I just call a mechanic (yes we have the nightshift emergency kind because fire alarm is high risk). I call dispatch to summon the mechanic and I sit down in this mega bonkersize of a building in the janitors hall. The one that had all the cameras throughout the school. And this is also where the fire panel was located.\nI take out my phone and decided to watch a movie while waiting for the guy.\nSo I am sitting in this little room, but right next to it is the common student room wich is huge. Its a massive open space square also going multifloors up. Needless to say it echoes like crazy. \nI was watching the movie but my eyes dragged all the time to the cameras, swearing I've seen something change in there all the time when I wasnt looking. \nI suddenly notice that on one of the camera screens in the basement a light is on. Creepy as hell cause in such an old building they surely dont have automatic sensors.\nI decided to walk out in the common room to keep an eye on things and listen if I hear something strange. \nIt is absolutely deafening silence. Not even a sound from outside can be heard at this point. Wich is one of the more odd things considering this school is dead center of a city.\nThe moment I wanted to walk back into the janitors room I hear a sound so loud that I jump up and froze. It sounded like a table thrown through the school. Imagine the echo it left in this crazy sized halls.\nSometimes you get a jumpscare so bad that the veins in your body tighten so fast it is actually painfull. This was such a moment.\nI listen in and the second after it becomes quiet for about 10 seconds. I slightly unfreeze again but all my body sensors are going off. I am 100% on and tense as hell. \nThats when I start hearing everything around me. Footsteps on the upper halls. People talking. Doors slamming. Tables and chairs scratching the floors. The sounds were definitly inside the building and comming from the higher floors.\nThats it, fuck it ... even my body tells me at this point its time to go. Every physicall feeling in my body tells me this is unsafe.\nI rush to the alarm system and the alarm system was next to a little window that showed the janitors room.\nI could see the camera screen and the lights in the basement went bonkers. From turning on and off to going brighter and more dimmed. \nI dont care at this point about the mechanic who just got called out of bed. I am saving my own ass it feels like at this point.\nI turn on the alarm and drive away. At that moment the mechanic phones me and says: hey bud listen up, you are probably the new guy but at night I don't enter that school. And you shouldn\"t either. That place is haunted like crazy. Even your colleagues dont wanna go there at night. \nThats when I realized this was the damn school everyone always talked about.\nThe mechanic wished me a good shift and told me he is gonna go back to sleep.\nThe rest of the night I was surely staying closer to my colleagues. Everyone knew I went there but no one asked questions about me being all shaken up. I got just one comment. \nWell now you know to stay away there.\nUnfortunetly this was not the last time I had to go there, and not the only thing I experienced there.\nIll upload another one about this school another day.\nAnyways happy new year guys!", "media": null, "score": 634, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comment_count": 100, "over_18": false}, "63": {"id": "18vkech", "locked": false, "subreddit": "glitchinthematrix", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Lexicicist", "link_flair_text": "Glitch Pic", "time": 1704519849.015372, "created_utc": 1704066978.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/tlcr7dt0yp9c1.jpeg", "title": "Uh patch when?", "permalink": "/r/GlitchInTheMatrix/comments/18vkech/uh_patch_when/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 10, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "comment_count": 6, "over_18": false}, "64": {"id": "18zby98", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ufo", "stickied": false, "category": "Aliens", "author": "MathematicianNo6402", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1704519850.509367, "created_utc": 1704474746.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ufo/comments/18zby98/plsstop_the_bs/", "title": "Pls...stop the BS.", "permalink": "/r/ufo/comments/18zby98/plsstop_the_bs/", "selftext": "This reddit used to be great. Now it's turned into every balloon/duck/bird/ in the sky is a UAP/UFO. There was no big huge aliens at he Miami mall. I'm a Florida resident about 10 miles from where this occured. Teens have been arrested (5 as of now possibly more). They were shooting fireworks at each other (don't know about you guys but we did this ALL THE TIME as kids, just not in public places). Sounded like gunfire, which fireworks do sometimes, a Karen called it in (probably multiple Karen's), and bc it sounded like gunfire in a populated public space, the cops came in HEAVY. As they should if they think an active shooter is hitting the mall and MIGHT be heading to the airport next. This is a HUGE embarrassment to the UFO community. Anyone who is seriously invested in this topic knows how this is going to affect our peers. 1000's of people who don't even live in the Miami/Florida area have jumped on board without ANY evidence except a video that is blurry AF and STILL shows nothing. I feel like anyone who has researched the UFO/UAP phenomenon in depth has already realized that people just come up with the most outlandish claims, and then throw the \"trust me bro I saw it on tiktok and now the government scrubbed it\", don't get it. Extraordinary claims need extraordinary evidence unless you just live by the \"trust me bro, I spoke with someone who worked with someone and they showed me something, but I CANT show you\". Not everything is UFO/UAP related. Especially not this. Waste your time on the stuff that CANNOT be proves instead of making false promises about 10ft aliens made of smoke, walking around a mall.

We were just general miscreants. But there was one time I truly believe we almost became victims of a child predator. \nIf anyone reading this also grew up in the 90\u2019s, you know that it was a different era. We\u2019d be out all times of the day and our parents would have no idea where we were. There were lots of kidnappings back then. I can remember multiple times that I was offered candy or asked by some creep to help him find his cat.

We were traipsing around this orange grove that bordered his street. We started pulling these little metal dam things off the irrigation channels and tossing them wantonly. All of a sudden we heard a sharp whistle and both looked up to see this man about 25 feet away from us wagging his finger and going \u201cuh uh uh.\u201d But his reaction was not at all proportional to the property damage we were causing. He clearly didn\u2019t own or work in the grove because instead of screaming at us to stop, he had a grin from ear to ear. I can still see his face in my mind all these years later and it gives me chills. \nJonny and I stood there for a second watching this guy, then we looked at each other and Jonny looked back toward the guy and shouted \u201crun!\u201d I look over and the guy is in an all out sprint toward us. Despite the physically exertion he was putting into his sprint, the grin was still there. Jonny and I ran harder and faster than we ever had before. We made it out of the grove and back to his house before noticing the guy wasn\u2019t behind us anymore. \nWe quickly forgot about it because Jonny\u2019s family had just gotten a Nintendo 64 and we started playing Mario. \nI can\u2019t remember if it was the next day or week but some time after this happened we were with his mom getting donuts and we saw a wanted poster with a sketch of a man that looked awfully similar the guy who chased us. He was wanted for trying to kidnap a boy outside of a school. \nJonny and I looked at each other and seemingly telepathically agreed to never say a word. I don\u2019t know why we never spoke up. Maybe because we were at that age where we\u2019d be relentlessly bullied by homophobes because of the mere possibility that we could have been raped\u2026 But we never did speak of it again. As I\u2019m typing this I\u2019m considering reaching out to him to see if he remembers and if it aligns with my memory of the incident. \nThere were so many different things that happened in my childhood in the 90\u2019s that could have easily ended with me dead. Somehow I\u2019m still here and I have my own family now. I trust no one because of incidents like that. I always have my head on a swivel. \nDude who may have been a child rapist that chased me and Jonny in that orange grove that day, let\u2019s not meet.", "media": null, "score": 55, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "comment_count": 8, "over_18": true}, "75": {"id": "18w63zm", "locked": false, "subreddit": "threekings", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Paranorm223", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1704519859.6189384, "created_utc": 1704141636.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/threekings/comments/18w63zm/experiences_with_the_picture_game/", "title": "Experiences with the Picture Game", "permalink": "/r/threekings/comments/18w63zm/experiences_with_the_picture_game/", "selftext": "I read about the picture game while doing research a while back.
