Although it was awhile ago, I still remember every detail like it was yesterday. If I had been alone I would have chalked it up to something else, but the fact both of us saw this thing is what really puts me off.\nPlease excuse the new account as well. I'm rebuilding from an older account because a ton of stuff I posted on it previously is kinda cringe looking back on.\n\u200b\nA friend and I were walking along a trail that runs alongside the main river that cuts through the city. There are some great wooded trails along the river and some of them even lead to neighbouring cities, but I digress. The sun was setting and it was that time of evening where it was insanely dark under the tree coverage but still fairly light beyond the leaves. I had turned on my phone flashlight to light the way and put on some music for the two of us to listen to while we hustled home. The bugs were starting to bite and being so close to the river, they get pretty nasty.\nI had paused to change the song on my phone and my friend glances to our left into the woods. She askes me 'what's that?' And instinctively I turn the light to where she was looking. In the darkness of the bushes and trees we watch as this thing takes off running deeper into the brush with its back turned to us. It was making a ton of noise- Twigs snapping, leaves rustling, it really didn't seem to care. Now, there are deer on this trail. I've seen a few on my walks during the day but this was absolutely no deer. Even in such a short amount of time the image of this thing running from us is burned in my mind.\nIt was on all fours. It had an awkward gait like a human trying to run on its hands and feet, meaning its arms were far too short compared to its legs to be running like that. This thing was white and the light reflected off its leathery looking skin. It was skinny with thin arms and legs. The two of us didn't stick around much longer after that and instead chose to run the rest of the trail until we hit the end that lead out into a set of soccer fields.\nWe never spoke about it after that and if we did, it was sort of in passing. That was until yesterday. I was scrolling the subreddit for my city and paused the minute I saw a title informing people to stay away from the river trails. Curious, I checked the post out.\nThe post described exactly what my friend and I had seen that night on those exact sets of trails by the river.\nI broke out into a cold sweat and immediately texted her despite not speaking for awhile as adulthood has kinda caught up to us both. She told me she STILL thinks about that encounter and does so at least once a week. I linked her the post and she was floored by it. I unfortunately won't be able to link to the post as it gives identifying details, but reading through the replies it was what you would expect from Reddit. People chalking it up to the guy being mentally ill, joking about him doing drugs, and people who genuinely took him seriously were being downvoted and mocked. Someone mentioned it was all bull and that stories of these things had been going around in the area since 1972, meaning this probably wasn't a one off experience from the beginning.\n\u200b\nI'm always a little hesitant to share the story out of fear that I'd get the same reception. I know what I saw that night and knowing it's possibly still in those woods along a set of trails I still walk to this day is kind of unsettling to me.", "media": null, "score": 210, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comment_count": 22, "over_18": false}, "10": {"id": "1b42li1", "locked": false, "subreddit": "cryptids", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "RadClaymore", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1709350164.0485692, "created_utc": 1709320176.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/780amm30jqlc1.jpeg", "title": "Stupid sexy moth man", "permalink": "/r/cryptids/comments/1b42li1/stupid_sexy_moth_man/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 208, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comment_count": 14, "over_18": false}, "11": {"id": "1azyzvb", "locked": false, "subreddit": "thetruthishere", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "rep-master", "link_flair_text": "Reincarnation", "time": 1709350164.2366953, "created_utc": 1708895303.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1azyzvb/remembering_something_i_shouldnt_be_able_to/", "title": "Remembering something, I shouldn't be able to remember", "permalink": "/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1azyzvb/remembering_something_i_shouldnt_be_able_to/", "selftext": "Just found this subreddit and I thought I would post my \"personal encounter with the unknown\".\nBack when I was a small child, like 3-5 years I told my mom multiple times that my dad had an car accident and killed his friend and I was there.

There was no kid in there, but we can't explain, how I knew it happened in the woods and that it was a crash against a tree. There were no kids on the car.\nIt might sound crazy, but I can't remember this incident very much now, but since my parents somehow were involved with this case, it stayed a bit more in my brain.

Why is this not more popular? I think it makes a lot of sense actually.    \n\n\nYou can only buy one type of mushroom (at most stores) and they even call it different names (portobello, button, baby bella, crimini) these are all the same mushroom. To me it looks like they are trying to deceive us by making it look like we have variety when we don\u2019t.    \n\n\nMushrooms really are medicine. They are full of nutrients and everyone is scared of them.    \n\n\nThe best medicine we have is antibiotics and it comes from fungus. Why wouldn\u2019t other fungus fight other bacteria\u2019s and viruses? Well they do. People aren\u2019t educated about them and fear them.    \n\n\nMycologists believe the entire earths crust is covered in mycelium. Sometimes I wonder if they are responsible for the evolution of all things; if they make planets living if you will. We should send them to Mars and Venus and the moon.     \n\n\nEven the rain needs mushrooms. The clouds can\u2019t hold water without enough debris and the majority of that debris is spores.    \n\n\nEvery breath you take has spores. These things are very significant\u2026    \n\n\nIn ancient China and ancient Egypt mushrooms were only for royalty commoners were punished for having them.    \n\n\nOn the Joe Rogan show with Paul stamets, Paul had to stop the conversation when joe was prying for info on portobello mushrooms, and he said, \u201cI can\u2019t talk about this because I could get killed\u201d     \n\n\nThe oldest mushroom fossil dates back 800 million to a billion years old\u2026.these things are incredibly evolved and don\u2019t even need to have sex (and they even look like a penis when they spread their \u201cseed\u201d). You can break them apart and more will grow and faster. This is even a cultivation method. To put you in perspective, we only date back around 300,000 years.\n\n\nI have been making my own extracts for a while now and I have been blowing my own mind with how much better my life has gotten since I started eating these and foraging and using them on my face and everything. Chanterelles, puffballs, boletes, honey mushrooms,     \n\n\nA lot of people believe you can travel to different planets and areas in space when you eat psychedelic mushrooms.     \n\n\nThere are fungi in the rainforest that target specific animals when they get too overpopulated and balance out the nature so to say    \n\n\nMaria Sabina is a Mexican shaman who gave mushrooms to celebrities and royalty once westerners discovered them for enlightenment. The Beatles and Rockefeller even got mushrooms from her.    \n\n\nI fasted on foraged mushrooms for 2 months and pooped out dead pin worms. This happened 4 years ago. This makes me think about the scene in the matrix where Neo gets bugged. Metaphorically the red pill work well synonymously.    \n\n\nThere are mushroom cave paintings around the world depicting bulls and mushrooms on the ground. Could this imply that they ate mushrooms and became artistic and were explaining that?    \n\n\nThere are pictures of Jesus with mushrooms in stained glass windows at very popular historic churches around the world.    \n\n\nlion\u2019s mane mushroom and reishi mushroom are sold as nootropic supplements. the 5000 year old mummified corpse \u00d6tzi was found in the alps in the 90s with Piptoporus betulinus attached to his belt. it may have been used as medicine.    \n\n\n19.LSD is also a fungus-derived drug made with ergotamine. ergotamine comes from Claviceps fungus.    \n\n\nergotamine is also used in a migraine medicine called cafergot. it was obsoleted in the 90s with the introduction of sumatriptan but it still works for many people.    \n\n\nIf you look up why psilocybin exists, the popular consensus is that it\u2019s a poison to keep bugs and animals away. What I\u2019ve seen is that they love that shit.I have seen families of centipedes come out from inside them. I have seen plenty of fire ant colony\u2019s build their ant hill over a turd a day after I picked giant mushrooms out of it. Squirrels eat them. Snails love them. Everyone knows the nat flys love them.    \n\n\nThe fact that they call the brain the \u201cdefault mode network\u201d when you become an adult and so little of your brain is lit up under an mri. But if you look at an adult on mushrooms or a child under an mri the whole brain is lit up. The creepy part is how they try to normalize it with the wording \u201cdefault mode network\u201d    \n\n\nCordycept mushrooms take over the minds of insects and are parasitic to the insect. Paul stamets developed a way to rid termites forever and it is not used because it solves the problem completely.  I sometimes wonder if psychedelic mushrooms are a symbiotic relationship when we eat them \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f     \n\n\nIt is illegal to possess psychedelic mushrooms but not deathcaps or destroying angels. What is the real agenda here is it really safety?    \n\n\nIm saying that big pharma is part of the mushroom conspiracy because they are the answer to big pharma. One time I asked my doctor about mushrooms as medicine and he said, \u201chave I heard of it? Im a victim of it!\u201d I thought that was very strange I still have no explanation.  \n\n\nIf life is a test I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a test how well we can listen to people. Maybe there is something special with them. Maybe we can listen and learn from them.     Does anyone agree with this? Let me know your thoughts.

And most people would think that nothing bad would ever happen there. But that is all false. As most of our patients are the elderly, there is plenty of deaths that occur at our facility. So I worked down in the dementia care ward, and there was a lovely resident that I cared for, for Hippa purposes, I\u2019ll name the person Beth. She was unfortunately put on hospice a few weeks ago, and she met her untimely death 3 days ago. She was 92. As a residential care associate it was my job to clean out the room for a new resident. As I walked in her room, it felt too cold, and that is weird because all nursing homes are always hot because the elderly get cold easily. I just felt a kind of cold that\u2019s only bone chilling. I tried to shrug it off as I took the sheets off of the bed. As I was bending over to take off the fitted sheet. I felt a push. It felt like cold hands pushed me with strength I\u2019ve never felt before. It happened so quick that I was just confused and scared. I quickly grabbed all the sheets, and booked it out the door. But when I turned my head around, I saw it. I saw a human like figure shadow in the closet. It was a quick look so I couldn\u2019t really identify the person. But I can say for certain that it was Beth, playing a prank on me before she departed to the afterlife, as me and her would play pranks on another while I took care of her.

A couple hours later when I woke up from my nap I realized that she was wearing a black shirt and it was just an  all white body when I looked at it the first time. Funny thing was I think she was the third car in line, we were in the left lane and she decided to cross two lanes to make a right. Maybe it wanted to get away from me?

If you can figure it out, bonus to you. My sister and I me (17 at the time) and her (14 at the time) shared a tent so we stayed up giggling and messing around quite a bit like uno or talking about boys she liked. Mostly for week one  in the two week trip it was fine, we slept and talked like normal. Until the second week where things took a turn. I have a really hard time with sleeping so when week two strolled around my sister would be passed out asleep and I\u2019d be sitting wide away for a hours at a time. \nWhile these hours where I sat awake I heard noises, crunching, shifting, growling, howling. The basic out door noises. For the next 2 days of week 2 I heard a lot of walking and talking in the woods, things like \u201ccome here\u201d or \u201chelp me\u201d sometimes I\u2019d hear faint whispering near my tent. I was honestly scared shitless. On the last 2 nights which  probably had been the worst, my sister was awake, both of us playing uno with her phone dead and mine on a cool 20%. \nAround maybe 2am my sister went to lay down and so did I. Until I heard thick foot steps around the tend, too heavy for deers or wolves but too light for bears or elk. It was almost like a person was walking around my tent. My sister was awake and quietly watched as someone or something pressed on the tent sides and door. Now my sister and I move all the little tent zippers into our tents at night to keep people from trying to get in. Clearly this person or thing was looking for said zippers. So we felt pretty smart. This was night 4 of week 2\nNow finally week 2 night 5. The same heavy footsteps the same touching at the walls and the same whispering to \u201ccome here\u201d and \u201ccome out.\u201d My scared booty waited until 5am where I sat outside waiting for my grandma. While sitting out I heard whispering and then screaming, the scariest most blood chilling scream in the world. It sounded like some kind of animal or person or something, but it was so loud I nearly peed myself. I was glad we left and even happier to not go back for 2 years. Does anyone know what  this is? Or if it was some dude lurking on our camp site?\nUpdate 1:talked grandparents ands they said tater tot their little American shepherd at the time has been snarling at something outside the tent walking around , whatever it was got scared and let out a husk growl and ran away. It was about 3am for them and it scared them.

He would be out of town for a week or so some times. One of these times him and his crew where working in a small town in a abandoned building stripping it of asbestos and likely lead.  Full containment, negative air pressure, respirators everything to contain asbestos in the room they where working in. \nAfter a few days they had made good progress on the job site. So they take a longer breakfast before getting to work that morning.  When they get their, the dumpster they where filling with bags and 55 gal drums was turned around and moved about 10 feet from where it originally was.  It was also on dirt and there was no tracks from a truck other then the tracks  from when it was put in place.\nSo my dad calls the company that owns the dumpster and asked if they moved it. They did not. He requested them to come and move it back to its original place.  He also called the local sherif to report the incident..\nThe sherif came by took the report. My dad loves to talk to people so he asked about the building. The sherif didn't know he said it was abandoned when he was a kid but kids like to scare eachother by saying it's a old insane asylum.  The sherif goes on his way and dad and his crew get back to work. \nThey set up a containment on the third floor I think he said it was 5 stories. As they are working they hear running in the room above them.  The crew starts cracking jokes about the building being a haunted insane asylum. They shrug it off and get back to work. A few hours later they hear a loud bang he described it as if someone threw a bowling ball on the ground as hard as they could. \nEveryone rushed upstairs to investigate but found nothing. The room is completely empty nothing that could have fell, no foot prints in the decades old dust. They allready had a productive day and they allready worked 10 hours they called it quits for the day.\nThe next morning they arrive to the jobsite and the dumpster is once again turned around and moved. My dad called the dumpster company and the sherif. Once the sherif arrives he files another report and they chitchat. The officer and my father have a military background so they hit it off.  The officer offered to stay on site that night hidden to see if he can catch the person who is doing this.  My dad describes the officer as a clean cut, wiery no bull shit attitude with a dry sense of humor. \nWhen my dad and his crew arrive the next morning the officer is gone and the dumpster is once again moved.  My dad calls the sherif station and a receptionist tells him the officer has taken a personal day off. They get get the dumpster moved in its proper place and get back to work.  This day the running around the building sounds where constant, up stairs, down stairs. Banging sounds even on the floors they allready gutted.  The negative air pressure machines  would loose power,  their lamps would cut off . They worked into the night to finish the job that day.\nOnce they had packed up they drove up the road and seen the sherif parked waiting for them.  The sherif had a flask and my dad asked how he was doing? The sherif told him when he stayed that night  he parked kinda far back and out of sight with a line of sight on the dumpster.\nAbout 2am 4 figures came around the corner of the building and stopped infront ofnthe dumpster. They stood there not moving for 25 min. The officer described the clothes as a Kkk looking robe but black. He said when they moved they had no bounce to their step, soon he noticed the robes hung down to their shins but could see no legs.  After 25 min they went to all 4 corners of the dumpster and did nothing for about 5 min. Then the dumpster came 5 feet off the ground and they all moved and the dumpster moved with them. The dumpster slammed back down to the ground and they went back around the building but the opposite direction. Once out of site the sherif put the petal to the metal and went home.\nMy dad never found out what the building was but he has been in a lot of abandoned buildings even abandoned mental institutions but never experienced anything out of the. norm", "media": null, "score": 141, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comment_count": 15, "over_18": false}, "41": {"id": "1az8e9c", "locked": false, "subreddit": "glitchinthematrix", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Xenc", "link_flair_text": "Glitch Vid", "time": 1709350182.7734673, "created_utc": 1708816220.0, "url": "https://v.redd.it/7c3mwll6okkc1", "title": "Florida's Split Sky", "permalink": "/r/GlitchInTheMatrix/comments/1az8e9c/floridas_split_sky/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 77, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comment_count": 1, "over_18": false}, "42": {"id": "1b2hjtl", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ufo", "stickied": false, "category": "Aliens", "author": "Nightshade09", "link_flair_text": "Tabloid", "time": 1709350183.8026407, "created_utc": 1709154618.0, "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-13128433/disc-shaped-ufo-ukrainian-military-warzone-footage.html", "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Disc-shaped UFO is filmed by Ukrainian military in warzone: 'What the f*** is this... maybe ram it?' | Daily Mail Online", "permalink": "/r/ufo/comments/1b2hjtl/exclusive_discshaped_ufo_is_filmed_by_ukrainian/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 153, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "comment_count": 29, "over_18": false}, "43": {"id": "1ayxb8c", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ufos", "stickied": false, "category": "Aliens", "author": "ExtremeUFOs", "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "time": 1709350184.975855, "created_utc": 1708788878.0, "url": "https://v.redd.it/7ksbwdygyjkc1", "title": "A lot of UFOs in the background of a space X launch doing weird maneuvers", "permalink": "/r/UFOs/comments/1ayxb8c/a_lot_of_ufos_in_the_background_of_a_space_x/", "selftext": "", "media": {"reddit_video": {"bitrate_kbps": 1200, "fallback_url": "https://v.redd.it/7ksbwdygyjkc1/DASH_480.mp4?source=fallback", "has_audio": true, "height": 480, "width": 852, "scrubber_media_url": "https://v.redd.it/7ksbwdygyjkc1/DASH_96.mp4", "dash_url": "https://v.redd.it/7ksbwdygyjkc1/DASHPlaylist.mpd?a=1711942184%2CNjllNDBlNWM0MmZlZWNiNjYxZTBkMzEzMTM5ZTk4MjEzNTBhNGYyMWIxY2Q2ZTlmM2ExY2RlZjcwYmYyMmU2OQ%3D%3D&v=1&f=sd", "duration": 59, "hls_url": "https://v.redd.it/7ksbwdygyjkc1/HLSPlaylist.m3u8?a=1711942184%2CNjU1OGFhYzI5MjIxODI1ZGRjZTA0Zjk0YzlkNmY4OTJkOWJjNjQ1NzQwZDM2ZjY5MDZiZmEwNDJiMDcxMDZjOQ%3D%3D&v=1&f=sd", "is_gif": false, "transcoding_status": "completed"}}, "score": 2629, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "comment_count": 906, "over_18": false}, "44": {"id": "1az9cnk", "locked": false, "subreddit": "aliens", "stickied": false, "category": "Aliens", "author": "twist_games", "link_flair_text": "Discussion :table:", "time": 1709350186.9869704, "created_utc": 1708818709.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/v17cduwcfmkc1.jpeg", "title": "Let's be honest most cases of alien abductions in bed are sleep paralysis.

Spent the early 80's and into the 90's as an avid member of the California Hardcore Punk scene, going to gigs, getting into trouble, fighting and boozing my life away when I wasn't working or sleeping . I've always loved horror and the paranormal and I've always had an itch for the great outdoors.  I'm an avid shooter and used to love hiking, biking my way thru the Sierra Nevada mountains and foothills, usually alone in an attempt to find a connection with .. life ?  The universe ?  Something.  Maybe god, if there is one, or the gods ( for you pagans out there ). At any rate, when I hit my late 20's , if there was nothing happening on the weekends music wise, I'd often pack my shit and zip up to the mountains alone for the day or weekend. A favorite spot was a place called Rock Creek, late spring and early fall there's rarely anyone else there, which is why I liked it, since it had bathrooms and, was a nice place to camp but, wasn't ideal when it was packed with people.   It was a mid fall October that found me up there, iirc I was 29 or 30.  I had a Toyota truck with a shell that I'd sleep in, taking my bike usually, food and gear and always at least a sidearm.  I never payed attention to anyone's rules and regs regarding firearms anyways, nobody tells me I can't protect myself from human predators. I long ago vowed to never end up in someone's trunk. That's my philosophy, and carrying either my 9mm or 357 always made me feel not 100% alone, or at the mercy of whatever. It gave the bear it's \"claws\" so to speak. Anyways...  I'm up there for the weekend.  There's one couple up there and the old ranger guy and me, so there's plenty of room to camp and no hassle, it was about 2 weeks before the campground closed for winter. I went up Friday night after work, got there about 10pm, unpacked a little to make room in the back of my truck, paid my fee and ate a late dinner, crashed out ( it was pretty damn cold! ) but nice to get away. I had a powerful am fm shortwave radio that I would listen to the Art Bell show on around that time, a favorite past time of mine. Next day, got up , breakfast, met the older couple and payed my respects to the ranger who I had gotten to know from going up there so often. Grabbed the bike and rode for a few hours on familiar trails. Did some fishing and headed back to camp. All the usual evening stuff, crashed again about ten. I woke up at one point cuz I had to pee, I kept a little jug that i'd go in, so as to not have to freeze my ass off walking to the bathroom. Just after I fell asleep again I woke up to the sound of a big rigs brakes on the curves of the road above the camp, a sound I had gotten used to. Then another sound that I could not figure out what. It was the famous \"whooping\" sound that gets attributed to the Bigfoot , although at the time I didn't know this . The noise wasn't close and was brief but it stuck my memory.  At the time I figured it was an owl. The simian nature of the noise never occured to me.  The rest of the weekend was uneventful and time moved on.  Fast forward to several years later.  One night I'm watching TV and Survivor man is on and it's the episode when he first heard that sound while collecting glasses or something.  I'm eating dinner while watching and as his story unfolds, I sit there for a second thinking WTF!.   The sound happens a few more times and as it's happening my hairs raised up, I'm starting to genuinely freak out, if you've seen that episode you know what I mean.  He doesn't like what he's hearing and inside he knows what it is that's making the sound, and he's all alone in the mountains. In the meantime my mind is back to the time at Rock Creek, the night I heard the exact , to the letter, same sound. There's no doubt in my mind, 110% the sound was identical.  I started crying, not out of sadness.  I don't know why honestly. I was scared, but in the middle of the city it's Bigfoot safe, it's the criminals you gotta look out for.  Still I replayed my night and that sound in my head over and over . I had heard a Bigfoot and didn't know it until 20 odd years later.  I thought about all the time I spent up there alone.  There was a couple other times that I inexplicably felt a feeling of dread, borderline terror, that made me quickly leave the area I was in, I didn't hear or see anything, the feeling just washed over me that I don't belong where I'm at and I need to leave quickly.  One of the times I was in such a scramble that I tripped over a rock and ate shit in a puddle, before getting back up and high tailing it back to my truck. I always figured it was either my imagination, maybe a bad spirit, maybe intuition.  I don't know. But I never went back to those areas again. And after seeing that show on TV that was the end of my love of the mountains.  After that is when my Interest in Bigfoot spiked, I was and continue to be both fascinated and horrified at the concept of a wood ape. I have zero desire to ever see one, hear one again,or have anything to do with one. \nIn closing, I'm supposed to move to Yelm Washington soon, and I'm not really looking forward to it.   That's my story, feel free to reply if you have something to share and I hope to enjoy this sub.

I always thought of it as some sort of alien but it could be something else, it for sure did not look human tho. I don't know how it looked exactly but have a vague memory of how it looked, this is because it's been so long ago. \nWhen I saw it I felt intense fear, I could not move or breath and my heart was going crazy. I don't know for how long I stood there but eventually I walked out of my room and my friend came out of the bathroom, we both went inside my room and went to play again. At that moment I did not remember what happened but still felt extremely scared. I must have looked scared too because she kept asking me if I was okay. \nI'm not sure when but maybe a few days or weeks later I started to remember what happened that day and got extremely scared to sleep. I never told my parents and kept it to myself, they just had to deal with me being scared lmao. I told my little brother a few years after it happened but everytime I talked about it or every time he would joke about it (he dind't believe me) I would freak out and this intense fear would fill up my body. \nThe picture of it standing there and the fear I felt stayed with me. \nI recently talked about it with my oldest brother because my younger one brought it up as a joke. My oldest brother really believes it could be a alien of some sorts, since he also believes to have seen one when he was younger. \nDoes anyone have the same experience or any idea what this could have been?\nI'm also planning to ask my younger brother if he remembers me telling him any detail about how it looked.\n\u200b", "media": null, "score": 41, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "comment_count": 27, "over_18": false}, "52": {"id": "1aymyeh", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ghosts", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Rare-Engineer-2402", "link_flair_text": "Personal Encounter ", "time": 1709350192.05637, "created_utc": 1708753392.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/1aymyeh/did_i_see_him_or_was_it_a_figment_of_my/", "title": "Did I see him or was it a figment of my imagination?", "permalink": "/r/Ghosts/comments/1aymyeh/did_i_see_him_or_was_it_a_figment_of_my/", "selftext": "TW: Death/Suicide\nLong story very short. In October of 2022, I got into a bad accident. I died 3 times that day.  I am a twinless twin; my brother committed suicide 11 years ago. My brother was present to me and saved my life in the accident. We talked and he kept saying it wasn\u2019t my time and I needed to go back. I spent several weeks in the hospital and had many visitors. I kept hearing about how some young man was seen at the scene with me, that he saved my life. In my mind, I saw this person as my brother and didn\u2019t think anything of it.  Then a doctor came to see me who didn\u2019t work in ICU. He was just stopping by to see how I was and apparently was one of the people helping me at the scene. When he first looked at me, minus the blood and glass, he was floored. He stated there a young man there helping me when the doctor took over who looked exactly like me. The young man seemingly disappeared at the scene and was not identified. My mother turned to me and asked if I saw my brother.  Not to upset her I said No. I now question everything. I don\u2019t know if I saw a ghost or if I just wanted to see my brother that badly. \nEdit: Not that it matters, but I put October of 2023 and it was October of 2022 when I was in the wreck.

We were an end unit, connected only on the right side of the home to the rest of the houses. Had lived there for at least a year maybe two when this happened, and during that time, never once heard a single sound coming from our neighbors who shared the other side of our wall.\nOne night, probably 2 or 3am, I woke up to the sound of our neighbor coughing. I immediately recognized how odd that was because we had never heard them at all through the wall. The coughing continued nonstop and appeared to get louder to the point where it no longer seemed to be coming from our neighbor but now inside my bedroom, like the origin of the sound had drifted through the wall toward me. The sound continued to drift toward me (and I was started to breathe very heavily like I was scared out of my mind). As it came to me and settled what felt lime two feet directly over me, the sound kind of morphed into a mechanical sound very similar to a scene from The Matrix where Neo\u2019s scream becomes synthesized. This crescendoed above me and then suddenly stopped.\nMy partner then woke up, not from the sound but from the feeling of me panicking and breathing heavily. I told her what had happened and she said something like, \u201cDefinitely just a weird dream half awake half asleep thing. But you do seem really scared.\u201d\nWe tried to go back to sleep, but within a few minutes the whole experience happened again, only this time, my partner could hear it all too and we were silently gripping onto each other very tightly as it was happening, now both of us panicking. I don\u2019t know why we didn\u2019t say anything or get out of bed but we both had a \u201cwe need to stay quiet and not draw attention to ourselves\u201d feeling. It happened the same as before, and when it was done, we both turned on our bedside lights and spent the rest of the night awake watching TV.\nI have never heard someone else have this same kind of experience.
