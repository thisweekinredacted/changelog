My dad had just passed away a few days ago from a car accident. He had to drive to Atlanta for work and sadly didn't make it. I think it was the third night alone with just my mom and my sister when I woke up to my mom standing at the edge of the stairs calling my dad's name as if she thought he or someone was trying to get into the house. This happened around the time my dad normally got home. He would get home around 4 to 6 am depending on the shift. What made this event stick with me all these years is what happened shortly after she started calling out. Theres a security keypad to the alarm at the back door that led to the garage and it started beeping in a manner that suggested someone was trying to enter the disarm code. After that my mom started freaking out. I began to climb out of bed and walk to my door when the bullhorn alarm started going off. The house was locked down and the garage closed and no one was supposed to be there. When I got to my door my mom was running and grabbed me she then took me to my sister's room across the hall and hid us both in the closet and locked us in my sister's room and I heard her calling the police. The cops showed up and searched the area for nearly an hour and found nothing. I remember I left the closet when the police showed up and watched them walk around our whole house and checked the surrounding woods. Too this day my mom thinks it was my dad's ghost coming home from work like he usually did. It's stayed with me all these years. Every door was locked but it sounded like someone came home and tried to turn the alarm off. Thanks for reading.

I first moved to Colorado when I was 21, to the small mountain town of Silverthorne. I was recruited by an exchange student program for college students in South America to come to the USA, work and travel during summer break in the South. Up to that point, I had never seen snow in my life, so I was extremely excited to be living in a cold, snowy place for once. I was going to be working at a very popular hotel in the town of Frisco, not too far from the hostel I was living in. The hostel itself had its own creepy stories, but I won't talk about them in details at the moment (that will be for later, perhaps). So far, I didn't know exactly what kind of job I would be doing in the hotel. All I knew is that I was supposed to show up there on a certain date and time to talk to the owner, an Ukrainian-American guy that was probably in his mid 40s back then. So I show up, introduce myself \u2013with the basic English I had at the time\u2013 and tell him I'm excited to start working there. He gives me a weird, long stare, almost as if he was analyzing me. He was a tall man with very pronounced (?) eyebrows, so that kind of creeped me out for a second. He then showed me to the restaurant and said I would be working there as hostess, besides delivering room service orders. I really didn't think my English was that good to be in close contact with the public back then (I thought I would be working back of the house or housekeeping), but he insisted. For those who are familiar with the area, this part of Colorado is not too far from Vail, so it's needless to say they get very, very busy there during ski season and I was dealing with customers from all over the world. That's when I also started helping out as a server during breakfast, and of course would get lots of orders wrong by my lack of English, which made the owner very mad. I remember one time that my coworker and friend was taking a little bit longer to wipe down one of the tables when we had guests waiting to be seated, so he grabbed the towel from her hand, yelled at both of us to get out of his and stop being so damn useless and then proceeded to throw the towel at her face. Let me just make a small note here to say that this girl was also an immigrant like me, with fantastic English and living in the country for years, but he would always try and find ways to show us how slow, dumb, or inferior we were compared to him, an American citizen. Then at night, after the place had slowed down, he would then act all apologetic and buy us drinks at the bar, make forward comments about my appearance and even caress (yep) my legs. I was starting to feel uncomfortable around him and would always try to not be in the same room as he was. During work hours, I would be focused on customers or talking to my coworkers, and I would never make eye contact with him if he was present. \nOn New Year's Eve that year, there was a big incident in the hostel I lived at. I was out that night with a few coworkers, but learned later that one of the residents had gotten way too high on who knows which drug and started chasing down one of my friends (also from South America) inside the hostel, while pointing a gun at him, yelling racist slurs and making death threats. He got arrested, but it was easy to say that most of the students living there no longer felt safe. While telling about the incident to one my coworkers the next day, the big boss overheard the conversation and immediately came to check on me and make sure I was ok. I thought he was being very nice and thanked him for checking. He said I should not be staying at the hostel anymore given the circumstances and invited me to stay in one of the hotel rooms, free of charge for the next 2 weeks, while I looked for a new place. That seemed very generous of him, especially given the fact the hotel would be completely booked often since it was the peak of ski season. I accepted his offer and 'moved in' the next day. I was so overwhelmed with happiness for finally having some privacy (I was sharing a room with 5 other girls in the hostel) and for getting some extra sleep before working my breakfast shift, since I was now literally living at work, lol. \n\u200b\nThat was until one night later that week where I felt extremely exhausted after being slammed in the restaurant all day and delivering orders to several rooms. I was ready to get cozy in my hotel room and go to sleep (I was off the next day). I think it was around 2 in the morning when I woke up completely groggy and noticed that my door room was open. I could see the lights in the hallway. Then I noticed the silhouette of a tall person, standing inside my room and watching me sleep. I couldn't see a face, but could definitely tell it was a man. As I start realizing what's going on, I hear a metal clanking noise, as if he was getting ready to take his belt off. WTF?! I yelled. \nThat person quickly got out of my bedroom. The next day I asked management and my coworkers and said there was definitely someone in my room the night before. They said I was probably dreaming or someone from housekeeping must have gotten into the wrong room. Wrong room? At 2 in the morning? Housekeeping? The owner didn't comment on the case, and stopped talking to me or even acknowledging my presence after that. To my relief, of course. \nNothing else happened. I moved on, got a new job, a new apartment to live in, etc. About a year after my little incident, while checking the local Summit Daily News, who do I see on the front page? Him. The owner. \nHe had been arrested the night before after getting two female hotel guests way too drunk at the bar and 'letting himself' into their rooms once they had crashed for the night. They woke up and there he was, standing in the room, staring at them, while getting ready to make his next move. \nThey screamed bloody murder and called the police immediately. \nWas it him in my room that night? I'm 99% sure it was, but kind of relived I didn't get to find that out. What creeps me out the most about this situation is that, what about those nights I completely crashed after one too many drinks? You know how the altitude can affect your alcohol tolerance, and oh man, it really did it for me. I'm from the sea level and not a big drinker, but a few times I woke up with zero memories from the night before. So, the unsettling question is: was that the first time someone got in my room? And how many more guests at this hotel had this happen to them without even realizing it?

Chickens and rabbits were running about as though terrified and hiding in any corner they could find. She looked around to see what was going on and noticed some of the fowls were looking upwards. Son instinctively she did the same, and to her great astonishment, she saw hanging in the air above the house, at roof-top height, and about four meters from her, a \u201cman\u201d who was seated on a box that was swinging to and fro and who was looking around as though seeking something.\n\u201cHe was big about 2 meters in height and dressed in a very shining one-piece garment with green, red, and white markings, and in a pair of skiing boots with square toes and square heels.\n\u201cHis features seemed to be dark, but a helmet with visor covered his face, and I only managed to see his eyes, more or less like ours, and to tell you the truth we gazed at each other for a brief instant.\n\u201cWell this man was hanging there in the air above the house and rocking to and fro, with one foot stretched down towards the roof as though he wanted to support himself on it. From the \u201cbox\u201d (which was about 50 centimeters Deep and about the same width---I don\u2019t know how long---) there was a rod sticking up, a rod with colored stripes. It must have been the control-handle for the motor, and it gave out a sharp hum that I could hear very clearly.\n\u201cA bit disconcerted at the sight, I shouted several times to my mother, but she didn\u2019t reply at once. Meanwhile, maybe because of my shouts, the man had moved away slowly eastwards across our threshing-floor area, which is 20 meters wide. I went over in the same direction to which the man was looking, I saw a very vivid light, as big as the full moon, coming from the north and also slowly moving eastwards.\n\u201cAs soon as I caught sight of it, I was overcome by a wave of heat. And, although there was a bit of mist at the time, the whole place around, the house and the threshing-floor, were lit up vividly for a few second like bright daylight.\n\u201cAfter passing across the threshing floor area, the man halted above a flat-topped hayrick, as though going to land on it. I approached him once more, puzzled by his incomprehensible gestures and once more we were staring at one another, this time at a distance of about three meters (this being the height of the hayrick).\n\u201cA few instants later, he departed, heading eastwards, with that light following at a distance, behind him.\n\u201cAt a bit over a kilometer or so in that direction lays the small cemetery of San Clemente, located on a hill.I watched the two objects-the man and the light-circle several times around the cemetery, and halt for a few seconds over it. Meanwhile, my mother had finally come out, and I showed her where to look, but she, not knowing what had happened, simply said, \u201cIt must be a parachutist!\u201d She was merely able to make out something in the distance, but unfortunately without being able to discern any actual details that might confirm my testimony.\n\u201cI did not see the light again, but the man must surely have dropped down into the cemetery and have spent the night there.\n\u201cThe whole thing lasted about fifteen minutes.\u201d\nSource: Gianfranco Lollino, Alieni in Italia (Moreno Tambellini)\nFun fact: There are rumors that Sensoli was interviewed but I couldn't find any information about it.", "media": null, "score": 78, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comment_count": 16, "over_18": false}, "26": {"id": "1af7ugj", "locked": false, "subreddit": "cryptids", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "ABucketofBeetles", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1706952375.1737874, "created_utc": 1706671278.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/bv7ezgyx1pfc1.jpeg", "title": "My doodle during class today!", "permalink": "/r/cryptids/comments/1af7ugj/my_doodle_during_class_today/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 127, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comment_count": 13, "over_18": false}, "27": {"id": "1aex4to", "locked": false, "subreddit": "thetruthishere", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Ill_Funny_5052", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1706952375.3136718, "created_utc": 1706643313.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1aex4to/saw_my_neighbors_eyes_for_the_first_time/", "title": "Saw my neighbor's eyes for the first time...", "permalink": "/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1aex4to/saw_my_neighbors_eyes_for_the_first_time/", "selftext": "I[27f] have interacted for the last year and half with my neighbor and her husband but mostly her.

I went up to my gym teacher to let him know I wouldn't be in class the next day as I would be attending a funeral. He was wearing sunglasses and he took them off as I was telling him and low and behold he had slit pupils. What's even weirder when I look back, I noticed all the gym teachers would wear sunglasses indoors.

After reading in bed for a bit, I drifted off at around 10:30 PM, only to wake up about an hour later to loud screams and people yelling profanities. I thought my girlfriend was watching a movie with the volume way up, and I went out into the loungeroom to ask her to turn it down a little. Instead, the TV was off, and my girlfriend was staring at the front door, with her eyes wide. Our apartment is on the ground floor of the building, and so our front door opens directly out into the lobby of the builidng. The voices in question were coming directly from the lobby- I could not make out specifics (In my defense, I was half asleep and the language of the country I live in is not my first language), but there was a lot of swearing involved. My first thought was that it was some kind of domestic dispute, but after listening I realised it was a group of men that sounded extremely aggressive. \n\u200b\nI looked at the WhatsApp group chat for my apartment building, and to my horror saw a message from one of the people in it that there were armed men in the building, and that we should not leave our flats. The country I live in is experiencing a marked uptick in crime, and I had heard stories of armed groups of men robbing entire apartment blocks - but these had seemed fairly apocryphal to me. However, that was my first thought- that these men would kick down our door and rob us. One of my dogs started to growl at the commotion outside- I shushed him and thankfully he obeyed. \n\u200b\nI heard a commotion in the apartment above me and went out to my patio to see what was happening. I heard what sounded like a large piece of furniture being knocked over, and women and children screaming in terror. At this point I had no idea what was going on, but I knew that by now they would have robbed us already, if that is what they had planned to do. My girlfriend and I decided to hide in a small shed at the end of our patio, monitoring the group chat on our phones. Our bigger dog silently stood watch outside the door of the shed, his eyes locked on the sliding door at the end of the patio. I would find my smaller dog later, cowering between the washing machine and the dryer.\n\u200b\nAfter ten extremely tense minutes, I heard the screeching of tires- signalling what I hoped was the perpetrators fleeing the scene. Eventually, someone in the group chat said the police had arrived, and breathing a huge sigh of relief, I came out of hiding and opened the front door. \n\u200b\nAlarmingly, on the floor of the lobby there were zipties that had been cut, and the security guard was talking to one of the tenants. The man was bleeding from a large gash on his face, and looked extremely shaken. \n\u200b\nOver the next few hours the story would unfold. \n\u200b\nThe man I saw, with the gash on his face, was the tenant in the upstairs apartment- the one that I had heard the commotion coming from. He was the owner of an import/export business and for whatever reason, had a sizable sum of money - in cash - hidden in his apartment. Someone had obviously found out about it, and planned out the robbery that woke me from my sleep on Friday night. A group of eight men had followed him into the apartment building's garage and ambushed him as he got out of his car, and judging from the gash on his face, roughed him up a bit. Some of the group of eight had gone to the lobby, surprised the security guard and ziptied him. The remainder of the group had gone up to the apartment, robbed it, and then fled the scene. \n\u200b\nIt is fairly chilling to think that armed men were mere meters from my front door.  So, to the armed men that stormed my apartment building to steal my neighbour's cash- let's not meet.

I appeared for 2 seconds, fading in, increasing is light intensity, before quickly fading again.

While she did various drugs I was always more of a pot head. When they said pot was a gateway drug I believe it\u2019s true to a certain extent with those who have addictive personalities. She definitely developed an addiction issue later on. My friend her name was KK was always down to meet people. She used to friend random people on facebook or instagram. She would ask me to hang out so that way when she met people I was the buffer just incase they didn\u2019t like each other. \nOne day she came over to my house unannounced and was like hey let\u2019s go to my uncles house, cause her aunt was there and her aunt had some goods. Her aunts happened to be down the road. Her aunt and her uncle were known as dealers in the area. So we went. When we got there she was like hey I met this guy online he goes by Joey Crack. Then she shows her aunts his pictures and wide set man, with a red goofy  face, cornrow braids, face tattoos and a gold grill. I laughed,  and said wow K you really know how to pick em. \nShe had already invited him over, so upon his arrival he then comes out of no where just walks right up and gives K a hug and everyone else there a kiss on the cheek. This part of town there was nothing around just houses, a school, and woods. Closest store was about 20min, so it struck me as odd that he walked here. So it was me, K, her aunt, and the aunts friend. We sit and get 3 joints in rotation. By this time both aunts are high as a kite on coke, they take a few puffs then go inside the house. Leaving me, K and Joey crack outside. Joey then starts asking us questions like how we know each other, what we do for a living etc. It was getting late so I was telling her I was going to go home. She was like no don\u2019t go yet. I told her I was tired and that Joey is weird, and he kept low key hitting on me. \nShe then tells me he asked to sleep with her and he wanted to asked her to ask if I was down. I laughed it off and said ya crazy. And after a while of silence, I deflected and heard some noise that\u2019s was in the darkness. \u201cYa heard that?\u201d.  After a bit of small talk between him and K he then learned that neither one of us was interested it was just a hang out. This then turns the mood you can feel it. It was suddenly eerie quite. He got reserved and shifty eyed. I sat down for a while just to please K. At one point I turned to Joey (knowing he walked here and it was dark by now) what you bouta do? Cause im bouta go home and K\u2019s coming with me. He was like \u201cI just texted my boy he\u2019s bouta come get me\u201d. When he was texting K was right behind him watching him texted. Her eyes grew wide and she looked at me. That was silent girl code for \u201cbitch wtf\u201d.\nK broke the silence and was like hey come help me get his thing from inside to bring it out. So I did, we went inside and she was like ima call my uncle so he can take us to your place. And I was like why? My house was like a 10 minute walk. She said cause when she was looking at Joey text. He sent to whoever was coming to pick him up the information of all of us here. He noted that her aunts were high on coke, as us along with our age. He was telling his boy to come over to basically to rob and rape us. And called dibs on the blonde one. I was the blonde one. Every hair stood up on my body with the thought of some gross goon tryna have his way with me. I was mad, cause she got me into this shit. \nWe came back out and continued our conversation with him so he wouldn\u2019t get suspicious of us. She mentions out loud that her uncle was on his way home. As he pulls in a sigh of relief comes over me. They speak briefly and Joey then departs into the darkness before his ride even shows up. K and I get a ride from her uncle to my house on the ride we noted how weird Joey was. Later that night as I was going to bed I check my Facebook and I have a friend request from Joey and a message. \u201cYou\u2019re so pretty I would love some alone time with you without your friend.\u201d The message ended with his number. I never blocked someone so fast. After this K didn\u2019t learn her lesson but that\u2019s another story for another time. A week later Joey was in the news he was wanted for SA, robbery and drug possession . A bullet well missed on my part.

My dad had just passed away a few days ago from a car accident. He had to drive to Atlanta for work and sadly didn't make it. I think it was the third night alone with just my mom and my sister when I woke up to my mom standing at the edge of the stairs calling my dad's name as if she thought he or someone was trying to get into the house. This happened around the time my dad normally got home. He would get home around 4 to 6 am depending on the shift. What made this event stick with me all these years is what happened shortly after she started calling out. Theres a security keypad to the alarm at the back door that led to the garage and it started beeping in a manner that suggested someone was trying to enter the disarm code. After that my mom started freaking out. I began to climb out of bed and walk to my door when the bullhorn alarm started going off. The house was locked down and the garage closed and no one was supposed to be there. When I got to my door my mom was running and grabbed me she then took me to my sister's room across the hall and hid us both in the closet and locked us in my sister's room and I heard her calling the police. The cops showed up and searched the area for nearly an hour and found nothing. I remember I left the closet when the police showed up and watched them walk around our whole house and checked the surrounding woods. Too this day my mom thinks it was my dad's ghost coming home from work like he usually did. It's stayed with me all these years. Every door was locked but it sounded like someone came home and tried to turn the alarm off. Thanks for reading. Glad to get this off my chest after so many years.  \nPlease don't delete my post just because I was young at the time. I have a right to share my history and trauma as anyone else would.

Poltava region, Ukraine Date: summer 2005 Time: daytime\nA young woman named Irina B, was living in a countryside cottage and was visiting\na secluded beach on the banks of the Dnieper River. She frequented the area\noften and knew it well. Her favorite area was an isolated small inlet covered with\nsandy beaches and bushes, the area had numerous gaping holes or crevices all\naround, some of them quite large, and possibly artificially made by locals. On this\nday she was lying by the beach sunning herself, and dozing off when she suddenly\nawoke with the feeling that someone staring at her. She opened her eyes and was\nterrified to see a huge bipedal lizard-like being about 2-meters in height and covered\nwith greenish scales standing very close to her. \nTerrified she wasn\u2019t able to scream\nand waited for the worse to happen. But suddenly she heard a voice inside her head,\n\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, my rations do not include albumen (protein) I am not going to eat\nyou\u201d. The witness was not sure if the mysterious voice spoke in Russian but she\ndistinctly understood everything that was said; the voice seemed to have correctly\nanticipated her apprehension. \u201cHow is this possible?\u201d was her only thought,\nand the voice answered her immediately, \u201cNothing unusual, simple\ntelepathy\u201d. She sat on her towel looking at the huge lizard-like being looming over\nher. \nThe voice inside her head once again reacted to her thoughts and said, \u201cYou are\nafraid of my appearance. That can be corrected\u201d. Then in a blink of an eye she saw\nthe most beautiful young man she had ever seen in her life. \u201cHow did you do that?\u201d\nshe asked in amazement, now feeling more curious than afraid, in a moment she\nreceived the answer, \u201cEasily. You see what you want to see. I simply compel you to\nsee what you want\u201d. They both began communicating by using telepathically. The\nlizard being told an amazing story, apparently he was a \u2018criminal\u2019 on his planet and\nother species on his planet had wanted to punish him, but he had\nsucceeded in escaping and had been wandering all over the Galaxy for a long time,\nhiding from \u201cbounty hunters\u201d that were chasing him. For some time now one of\nthese holes at the beach had become his shelter. But he was now tiring of hiding and\nwanted to be found and \u201cpunished\u201d. He had evidently been observing her every\ntime she had come to beach for a while. She reminded him of his home planet\nwhere the creatures also liked the sun and the water. He just wanted to chat with\nher since he had been an outcast from his planet for so long. At the end of the \nconversation the \u201clizard man\u201d told Irina that he would erase her memory, or her\nbrain would not sustain such huge volumes of new information and would\n\u201cexplode\u201d. \nHe promised that it wouldn\u2019t be painful, suddenly everything around her\nwas encased in a bluish light, and horrified she watched the body of the lizard being\ndissolved into nothingness. And next she lost consciousness. She was briefly reported\nmissing and a search was organized to find her, her parents and neighbors found\nher the next day on the beach. She was found lying on the sand bleeding from her\nnose and one ear. The doctors at the hospital were puzzled thinking that she might\nhave had a brain hemorrhage. She was considered to be alive only by a miracle. The\nwitness insists that she did not invent the story even though she is aware that it\nsounds like the ravings of a lunatic.\nSource: Letter from the witness in: \u201cInteresnaya Gazeta\u201d (Interesting Newspaper) D block, Kiev Ukraine # 4, March 2006 (sent from Anton Anfalov to Albert Rosales)\nI have requested the original transcript from Anton Anfalov after receiving his email from Albert Rosales (Anton Anfalov stated this was basically the encounter as is) but if there is any more information regarding this that wasn't sent over I will update it.", "media": null, "score": 25, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comment_count": 5, "over_18": false}, "53": {"id": "1ad7p82", "locked": false, "subreddit": "cryptids", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "Old-Hat-2169", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1706952393.7220714, "created_utc": 1706462502.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/9ena7kf4t7fc1.jpeg", "title": "Also my Mothman tattoo", "permalink": "/r/cryptids/comments/1ad7p82/also_my_mothman_tattoo/", "selftext": "Posted my Baba Yaga tattoo earlier, so I thought y'all cryptid lovers might enjoy Mothman, too. \nSame artist: Patrick at Arcadium Tattoo in Lake Crystal, MN", "media": null, "score": 50, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "comment_count": 3, "over_18": false}, "54": {"id": "1ad5jx4", "locked": false, "subreddit": "thetruthishere", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "jedainz", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1706952393.8676345, "created_utc": 1706456939.0, "url": "/r/Ghosts/comments/1acwnrs/husband_had_night_terror_and_saw_a_mayan_ghost/", "title": "Husband had night terror and saw a Mayan ghost while in Cancun", "permalink": "/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1ad5jx4/husband_had_night_terror_and_saw_a_mayan_ghost/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "comment_count": 1, "over_18": false}, "55": {"id": "1ad33gy", "locked": false, "subreddit": "letsnotmeet", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "its_just_dally", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1706952394.0047324, "created_utc": 1706449902.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1ad33gy/harassed_chased_down_by_a_car_while_walking_with/", "title": "Harassed (chased down?) by a car while walking with my mom", "permalink": "/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1ad33gy/harassed_chased_down_by_a_car_while_walking_with/", "selftext": "\n\nSkip down if you do not care for context (Edited the story to add the proper ending, I wrote this kind of fast originally)\n\n\nOkay so for context for this story, I live in a pretty rural area. We live on the outskirts of our town which already is small compared to the populations of the other towns in California - we're about 15 minutes from the small town and 40 minutes from the main city. We live down a dirt road with some neighbors, our house has no other fences attached to ours and on two sides of the house is only fields and dirt roads, one side having a single house in the field. The other two sides have a couple neighbors down other roads and nobody really interacts out here except my dad talking to two of them sometimes. \nI was probably 12 when this happened - I had low self esteem and I wanted to start exercising more. I had been enrolled in a charter school due to bullying (yes, that played into my self esteem but let's get on with the story.), so I didn't really have many ways of exercise besides a treadmill that we owned. I wanted to start getting fresh air too so my mom suggested that since we live out here that it would be peaceful to take walks down the back dirt road. I agreed even though I was stubborn about it half the time, but we began walking and usually would go in the mid to late afternoon when it would start cooling down outside but was still light - in case it got dark we took our flashlight too. \nBeing out here, it was notorious for stray dogs to sometimes make their way out here and we would carry pepper spray and a mini bat just in case one got vicious - however a dog will play into this story. One day me and my mom decided to go on a walk in the later afternoon. So me and my mom took off and started walking down the road. When you walk about a quarter of a mile down the road, you start to come towards a little cross section. There's a road going left to the highway, a road going right to the neighbor's house, or the road goes straight down to a utility road. Me and my mom discussed walking down the utility road to get a good walk in since it went on for a while. \nWhen we started getting to the cross road this dog came out of literally nowhere. We were looking at it and it was in the center of the roads, staring at us. Me and my mom looked at it and my mom said that she got this feeling in her stomach that we needed to turn around and walk home. So she grabbed my arm and started leading me back home and then let go so that we could walk. We were in the midst of walking when she looks ahead and stops to stare at something. \n\n\nStart here if you do not care about context\n\n\nI ask what she's looking at and she points. A white car pulled up to our fence and quickly backed up and shot down the road on the side of our house. Mind you nobody ever goes down this road except one old man that we know - anyone else who does usually is scoping out my dad's tools to steal. My mom said she felt a bit uneasy because of it and pulled me to the edge of the dirt road, almost into the field. The car had driven to the highway and left, or so we thought. \nWe continued walking back to our house when this car comes back and drives down the road we were walking alongside. I caught a glimpse and it was this smaller white car with black tinted windows that you couldn't see through. My mom instantly got a feeling of impending doom and pulled me into the field, not too far but far enough. We kept walking through the field towards our house, getting closer now, when this car comes back down the road. My mom stops me in my tracks to see what the car is doing, and it drives back to our house and starts driving around it super fast (for context, we have a random road and area that goes around our yard on our property.)\nMy mom waits until the car drives back down the side road and she tells me we need to start running, so that's what we did. We started running through the field, getting to one of the little sections near my yard. The car comes back and drives down the road trying to cut us off. Me and my mom are panicking at this point and have no idea who this is and why they're acting like this. The car circles around again and my mom drags me to further to the (right? I think.) of where we were and told me we're going to run down into the ditch. We get down in the ditch and the car comes back around and pulls to the edge of the ditch where we were. \nThe front of the car was facing us and all I could think about was if it drove down, it would hit me and my mom and probably kill us. My mom quickly put her arm in front of me and stood dead still while I was literally horrified and dropped our flashlight and I think my water bottle. The car was getting ready to drive down where we were and then suddenly they backed up and drove around the yard, going back down the side road to the highway. \nMe and my mom felt like our souls left and she tells me to run, don't look back, and get to the front gate. I run up the ditch, feeling my heart pounding. I run around the yard and towards the front gate, flinging I open and I started running towards the front door. I did not hear my mom behind me - I was running to the door to open it right when I looked over and saw the car coming back down the side road. I ran into the house, trying to catch my breath. I saw the car drive down the road and I didn't see my mom, so I was panicking. \nI ran towards the sliding glass door and suddenly my mom comes running towards it and flings it open, running in and locking it. She tells me to go lock the front door while I try to catch my breath and tell her I was scared because I had no idea where she was. She went to chug some water from the fridge and told me that when I was running, she was trying to shut the front gate when she noticed the car coming back down the road. She said she knew she wouldn't have time to follow me to the door so she ran behind my sisters car to stay out of view of the car, and when it drove back down the road she took the opportunity to run to the back door since it was closer to my sister's car.\nIt's crazy to think that if we hadn't seen that dog standing there in the road and decided to turn back, that we may of been run down. Fortunately we haven't seen the car again and think it may of just been some crazy person or druggie who just so happened to come down our road that day.

Almodovar added that as he walked\nslowly into the room he was paralyzed with fear as he saw one of the little men go flying out the\nopened window, the little man had been standing on top of a chair and was seen to push on it\nwith his feet in order to propel himself outside the window. He further described the entities as\nabout 3 feet tall, with long arms, and short legs. Their heads were large and flattened on the\nback, with two large pointy ears very close to the sides of their heads. A very peculiar detail was\nthat on their foreheads each had what appeared to be protruding antennas. Their feet were\nsmall and appeared to be bare. Their clothing was transparent, resembling plastic, one-piece,\nshiny green in color. Their skin appeared to have scales \u201clike fish\u201d.

Given the unwonted hour he was astonished, and he\nasked what was going on. The entire group of people seemed to be highly excited---especially\none woman who was screaming that she had just seen some children or strange little men,\npassing by, who had huge heads and huge eyes. They had passed in front of the cars, and the\npeople were still parked there and talking about it, \u201cbecause the things were still there\u201d. Mr.\nFigueroa replied that no doubt somebody had want it to play a trick on them by dressing up, or\nsomething of the sort. But his curiosity aroused he drove on in the direction of the road towards\nBoqueron which was whither the little men had gone. And to his immense surprise, he saw,\nbeside the highway, five most strange little beings---two of them taller than the rest, about 4 ft\nwhile the others were about 3ft. \nHe said, \u201cTheir clothing or something---I don\u2019t know whether it\nwas clothing or their own skin---because they were all gray, was from head to feet. But at the\nknees and elbows they had what looked like \u201csections that passed one into the other\u201d. Their\nheads were big and egg-shaped. Compared to their bodies, the heads were large, and their eyes\nwere big and shining. He noticed also that their ears were long and pointed, just as the people at\nhis place of work had said. He said that on their feet they had only three large toes, and on their\nhands only three large fingers. As he drew closer to them, his headlights lit them up. Then one\nof them, turned around towards him, and he noticed that it had large slanted eyes emitting a\nvery brilliant white light. He could also see that for noses they had merely tiny holes, almost no\nnoses at all, and their mouths were extremely thin and tiny, as though with no lips at all. \nTheir chins were very small and very pointed. And then the rest of them all turned around too and\nbecame enveloped in a very bright light. It was a very powerful light like a welder\u2019s torch that\nblotted out the headlights of the car. Figueroa became frightened, and seeking to cover himself\nreversed the car and backed away from them a bit. And when he pulled off to a distance, they\nturned away again and continued walking on again along the road just as though nothing had\nhappened. However, Figueroa still followed them at a distance. A bit further on, he saw that\nwhen on the road they came to a little bridge over a ravine, they jumped down, one after the\nother, and went off towards the left along the edge of the ravine and vanished there, while\nFigueroa remained sitting in his car petrified with fear.\nSource: Magdalena Del Amo Freixedo, FSR Vol. 36 # 4\n\nLocation.

They had what appeared to be mole-like marks under their eyes & their\nnoses & mouths were almost indistinguishable. They had thin bodies with long skinny\narms. They all wore dull silvery uniforms. With their delicate hands the beings began\ntouching the witness all around her stomach and chest area, at the same time talking to\nthemselves in a low murmur like chatter. The witness was then startled to see that the\nbeings had somehow opened her chest area, without her feeling any pain or discomfort,\nthey seemed to be checking her internal organs, including the heart, which she saw it\nmove as it pumped blood to her body. During the whole experience she felt a sense of\njoy and peace, and was convinced that the beings were benevolent and were here to\nhelp.

Guanica, Puerto Rico Date: October 20 1995 Time: late night\n\nThe 5-year-old witness woke up hearing a noise. He then noticed a shadow next to the door that\nseemed to be running back and forth. Afraid he hid under the covers, but could still see\nthe shadowy figure. He then got up and saw a short dwarf like figure outside the room,\ndescribed as thin, with a wide face, with large pointed ears, huge dark eyes, and light\ngray wrinkled skin. The dwarf made some hand gestures and showed him something\nresembling a cross and a piece of paper. The witness then looked outside and saw a\nmetallic object with several bright lights hovering close to the ground. A beam of light\ncame out of the object and retracted the dwarf-like creature inside. The object then left.\nSource: Jose Martinez Puerto Rico Research Group\n\nLocation. Guanica, Puerto Rico Date: October 21 1995 Time: late night\n\nA young boy (involved in the previous encounter) was sleeping when a powerful light entered\nhis bedroom. The brightness of the light woke him up. He then saw a small reddish\nsphere come in through the window and fall to the floor. When it hit the ground, it\ntransformed itself into a short dwarf-like creature, with long pointed ears, and huge oval\nshaped eyes. Screaming he ran to the closet. His grandfather who had noticed the bright\nlight in the boy\u2019s room now came inside to see what had happened. Upon entering the\nroom he saw the bizarre creature. He tried to hit the creature with a bat, but the\ncreature suddenly transformed itself into a ball of light and shot out the window.\nLooking out the window he then saw a landed metallic object on the patio resting on\nseveral legs. It had several lighted windows and lights. Suddenly the object shot up into\nthe sky at very high speed.\nSource: Jose Martinez, Puerto Rico Research Group\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/f3I9LjI.jpeg\nLocation: Santa Terezinha, Piracicaba, Sao Paolo, Brazil August 27th, 1996\n\nA luminous object measuring four meter sin diameter, flew over the area late at night and then landed in an empty plot of land. The phenomenon, according to local residents, was witnessed by ore than a hundred people. Witnesses said they saw it when it flew over the Santa Terezinha neighborhood at a low altitude. According to the witnesses, the ship was very bright, and did not emit any type of sound.\nThat same night, Joao Galvao Coelho and his wife Ivanete were returning home on their motorcycle, when they saw a luminous object, that was flying overhead at a low altitude. At first, Joao thought it was an airplane, but after observing it better, he concluded that the maneuvers carried out by the strange object were unconventional. According to Coelho the object, the object was approximately four meters in diameter and had dozens of colored lights surrounding it. \nAfter a few minutes, the UFO made a sudden turn and began to descend diagonally. Joao and Ivanete thought the object was going to crash and decided to follow it to make sure it was something unexplained. When they arrived near a vacant lot, they now realized that the object was hovering about 60cm above the ground. Joao stopped his motorcycle at approximately eight meters from the location and began flashing his headlights at the craft.\nAt that moment, Ivanete was able to observe a kind of ramp that began to descend from the bottom of the UFO. The ramp had the same shades of light that shone around the object, that is, red, yellow and green. Then, according to the witnesses, three small beings, approximately 50cm tall, with large heads disproportionate to their bodies, descended on this ramp. \u201cIt looked as if they were wearing helmets, they had huge ears and on the top of their heads, an antenna from which red lights were flashing,\u201d declared Joao. The three creatures each carried an object similar to a pen in their right hands.\nThe beings then went towards the couple, but the frightened couple drove away in a panic. Upon arriving at their house, they found that several neighbors had also observed the same phenomenon.\nUfologists at the site reported finding three symmetrical perforations on the ground, which formed a triangle, and in the center a fourth hole. Experts took samples of the vegetation to check whether there had been any chemical changes with the plants.\nSource: UFO Genesis, UFO landing in the interior of S\u00e3o Paulo https://ufo.com.br/artigos/aterrissagem-de-ufo-no-interior-de-sao-paulo.html (defunct source) also Claudeir Covo (INFA), & Diario do Povo newspaper \u2013 September 4 1996, & Eduardo and Osvaldo Mondini, CEPEX.\n\nLocation. Penuelas, Puerto Rico Date: September 26 1997 Time: 2200\n\nIvan Rivero Morales and several other witnesses watched an object flying around a nearby\nmountaintop for about an hour and then land on the summit. The intensity of its light dwindled\nto a soft amber glow, which it retained during the duration of its landing. To the witnesses\nsurprise that were watching the object with binoculars and telescopes, a number of tall beings,\ndescribed as greenish with large oval shaped heads, black eyes, pointed ears and a protruding\nbelly descended from the object and walked around the summit for one hour. After this length\nof time had elapsed, the beings re-entered the craft and its brilliance increased to previous\nlevels, it then vanished in a matter of seconds.\nSource: Federico Alvarez Frank\n\nLocation. Penuelas, Puerto Rico Date: September 27 1997 Time: night\n\nLocal residents again watched an object land on the summit of a nearby mountain, but this\ntime it was accompanied by another, smaller object. The large object landed on the same spot it\nhad occupied on the previous evening, and its tall greenish occupants descended once more\nfrom within. On this occasion, the beings, described again as having protruding bellies, long thin\narms, large oval shaped heads, with pointed ears, remained outside for two hours, while the\nsmaller object remained motionless over the location. After two hours both objects rose into\nthe air and vanished from the location. The only means of access to the mountain top is by\nhelicopter.\nSource: Federico Alvarez Frank\n\nLocation. Lima, Peru Date: 1999 Time: late night\n\nA family was woken up by the sound of something falling on their roof and then footsteps.\nLooking out the window they saw a short humanoid figure, described as having a greenish head,\nwith pointy ears and a brown body that had apparently jumped from the roof to their patio. The\nentity scurried away in a peculiar sideways fashion and was quickly lost from sight. \nno source given\n\nLocation. Not given Date: June 18 1999 Time: late night\n\nAdam Clark woke up in a cold sweat and heard a high pitch humming sound coming from\noutside. Deciding to investigate he walked outside and saw a large triangular shaped object with\nan orange light on each corner and a pink light in the middle hovering over the yard. As he\nstared at the object he suddenly found himself in a cold dark room sitting on a cold metal \u201ciron\nboard.\u201d There were two \u201clittle green men\u201d with pointy ears, and long arms that went down to\ntheir knees. He heard a telepathic message from one of the humanoids telling him that they\nwere going to give him an implant. He screamed and remembers the little men walking towards\nhim. His next memory was of standing in the yard and looking up and the object disappeared\nback up into the sky. He has no further memories.\nSource: Starbuck\u2019s UFO Abduction Page\n", "media": null, "score": 13, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "comment_count": 2, "over_18": false}, "66": {"id": "1aggc6h", "locked": false, "subreddit": "cryptids", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "dre_the_brazilian", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1706952402.9315197, "created_utc": 1706808279.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/zjcjehgbd0gc1.jpeg", "title": "What are your thoughts on the sewer gators?", "permalink": "/r/cryptids/comments/1aggc6h/what_are_your_thoughts_on_the_sewer_gators/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 48, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "comment_count": 34, "over_18": false}, "67": {"id": "1ahnm6o", "locked": false, "subreddit": "letsnotmeet", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "SYPFTW_16", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1706952403.222107, "created_utc": 1706934584.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1ahnm6o/man_with_a_briefcase_asks_me_to_call_a_taxi_for/", "title": "Man with a briefcase asks me to call a taxi for him", "permalink": "/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1ahnm6o/man_with_a_briefcase_asks_me_to_call_a_taxi_for/", "selftext": "This happened seven years ago when I was in my early twenties.\nMy boyfriend at the time and I both worked but were very poor so I went to the Department of social services to apply for food stamps.\nWhen I pulled into the parking lot I noticed the lot  was empty except for an older man with a briefcase.\nThe man looked out of place but I rolled down my window slightly and asked if the office was open.

This morning it started happening again and he collapsed once got up and said I needed to call 911. He said something was different this time. By the time the paramedics got him to the hospital his heart rate was down to 20. He was surrounded by a team of nurses and doctors trying everything to bring his heart rate up. This was when things got weird.\nThey started to shock his heart to get it into a normal  rhythm. Each shock he said was extremely painful. During these shocks my husband looks up in the room full of drs and nurses and sees an older lady in normal clothing, no badge on, approach him. This furring all the chaos of multiple medical staff trying save his life. The older women reaches him and whispers in his ear. She tells him not to worry everything will be ok. As she was speaking to him an incredible warmth filled his body and any fear he had went away and he felt calm. The woman walks away. The Drs determine he needs an emergency pacemaker installed. He has the surgery and then things get weirder.\nIn ICU recovering he shares the story with me about the lady in the ER. While sharing this story with me he is very emotional and crying. I ask the nurse if their would have been anyone in the ER that would have approached him like the old lady inn street clothes did and she said no way.ok this is definitely getting weirder. For context my husband is a 43 year old, pretty much an atheist who doesn\u2019t believe in ghosts or angels.  After a few days he is released from hospital. He goes home and I post this amazing story on Facebook.  A couple days pass and our take on reality is shook to our core.\nI am sleeping on his third day home when I hear him screaming and crying. Oh my god it\u2019s her! It\u2019s her omg! I run to the room his is in and he is balling. I ask what\u2019s wrong and he shows me a picture on his phone. It\u2019s an obituary featuring a picture of an old lady. It\u2019s her he cries. The obituary was text to him from a close friend of ours. She had saw my post about his ER experience and did a search of the people who had died in the hospital the same day hee was in the ER. The lady I was looking at had died around the same time he was in the ER. Wtf!", "media": null, "score": 480, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "comment_count": 68, "over_18": false}}}
