Anyone who has called them fake worldwide are always those who have not come to study them in person.\nAlso, The University of Ica is a SUNEDU accrediated unverisity, which is the highest accreditation Peru can give to a university. No one questions their authenticity as far as following the scientific method in their studies.\nI don\u2019t know where your personal goal posts are, but this crosses mine for sure. I believe!\nEDIT: This has not yet been published on the university\u2019s website, but the following letter was read from the congressional hearing with the university\u2019s permission:\nSan Luis Gonzaga National University\nYear of the Unity of Peace and Development\nStatement from the San Luis Gonzaga University of Ica on the Case of the Desiccated Three-Digit Nazca Bodies\nThe National University of San Luis Gonzaga (UNSLG) of Ica, Peru, through its research team, wishes to address the national and international scientific community, as well as the authorities and the general public, to report on our study regarding the desiccated three-digit bodies with both human and reptilian characteristics that have become known in the media as the Nazca mummies. These mummies were discovered in the provinces of Palpa and Nasca, in the department of Ica, Peru. Over time, this finding has gained notoriety in the media, generating controversy and debate. In this context, we wish to clarify and communicate the following:\n\n\nOn August 1, 2019, the San Luis Gonzaga National University of Ica, Peru, received four desiccated bodies with both human and reptilian characteristics. These specimens were handed over by maintaining the confidentiality of the source of information according to the second article, subsection 18, of the Political Constitution of Peru. The delivery of these bodies was carried out for the purpose of their custody, conservation, and the conducting of research aimed at clarifying the authenticity of said desiccated specimens.\n\n\nThe largest body, which we call Maria, has a size similar to that of a human but with notable anatomical differences, including an elongated skull and the presence of three digits on both hands and feet. The osteological analysis of the limbs shows structural harmony and congruence without evidence of phalange mutilation and instead shows inflammatory sequelae in the dorsal spine and feet, except in the case of the smallest body that we have named Wawa.\n\n\nThe smaller bodies, approximately 60 cm in length, exhibit a morphological and anatomical structure that differs significantly from the human one. The skin has morphological and histological characteristics resembling those of reptiles, and both hands and feet are three-digited. In addition, they have voluminous skulls, and their bone and joint system generally differs notably from human anatomy, showing unique and sui generis atypical features. It is significant to highlight that no rigid or metallic elements of union and support have been found in the joints of the entire body. Due to the uniqueness of these bodies and the marked anatomical and structural differences, more exhaustive investigations are required to better understand their nature.\n\n\nMetallurgical analysis carried out using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of a pectoral metallic implant revealed an important finding. It was determined that the implant is composed of an alloy of various metals, with osmium being the predominant element. It is noteworthy that osmium is an element that was officially discovered by Smithson Tennant and William Hyde Wollaston in 1803. Owing to its electrical properties, osmium is used in the manufacturing of some electronic devices and in the production of sensors. Additionally, the microscopic study through optical metallography has revealed the existence of a matrix of microstructures with microporosities and microinclusions in the implant.\n\n\nHowever, despite the advances that point towards the confirmation that these bodies are biological and real and the presence of osmium in a metallic implant, it is evident that more exhaustive studies are needed due to the marked morphological and structural differences that have been detected through comparative anatomy. Therefore, it is important to highlight that these preliminary results are not conclusive.\n\n\nDuring the period of custody and conservation of the desiccated bodies, our research team, mostly composed of medical specialists, has faced multiple obstacles and difficulties in the execution and proper completion of the investigations. These challenges include the pandemic, budgetary limitations, lack of institutional support, lack of logistics, necessary equipment and technology, as well as legal interference by entities such as the Ministry of Culture and the Public Ministry, among others. Despite these obstacles, we have managed to carry out imaging studies based on radiographs and tomographies using resources provided by the researchers themselves and metallurgical studies with the support of the National University of Engineering (UNI).\n\n\nIt is important to emphasize that at no time has the research team claimed that these bodies belong to extraterrestrial beings. Our approach has been focused on the study of biological bodies of unknown origin that existed in ancient times but are not human. Our approach is based on rigorous study and the search for answers within the realm of science, without making speculative claims about the nature of these bodies.\n\n\nIt is important to stress that from the beginning, no member of the research team has been motivated by media, political, economic interests, or any other kind.\n\n\nOur sole intention has been to carry out scientific research in order to rigorously determine whether the desiccated three-digit humanoid bodies are authentic or forged, whether they are of biological origin or not, and to unveil the mystery surrounding their authenticity. Our commitment has been to the advancement of scientific knowledge and the search for objective answers regarding these specimens.\n\n\nFinally, as a result of our investigations, the research team has concluded that the studied desiccated bodies are completely authentic from a biological point of view and show no signs of having been tampered with or artificially assembled. Our scientific approach has been rigorous, and the results contribute to the authenticity of these bodies.\n\n\nSigned by 11 professors from the San Luis Gonzaga University of Peru https://i.imgur.com/UGSLHeh.jpg\nSeal at top: https://i.imgur.com/Ca0OncJ.jpg \nWebsite of university: https://www.unica.edu.pe\nRanking: https://edurank.org/uni/san-luis-gonzaga-national-university/ (NOT https://edurank.org/uni/private-university-of-ica/)\nMSM: https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexican-congress-holds-second-ufo-session-featuring-peruvian-mummies-2023-11-08/\nSource video of conference where letter was read, starting at 1:09:59: https://www.youtube.com/live/XHyMlkm7Njo?si=RL_yqCBSNR1NwaKO\nSummary of full conference with time stamps:\n44:24 Unidentified Anomalous Objects (UAO) sightings testimony\n47:21 UAO audio recording evidence\n49:39 Q&A\n52:00 UAO sighting videos\n1:10:11 Declaration of the University of Ica about the (Non-Human) Dessicated Tridactyl Bodies from Nazca (preliminary research findings) \u2014 must watch\n1:20:34 Story of this archeological discovery (there\u2019s an underground location that is in a bad conservation state with more bodies)\n1:24:12 Presentation of humanoid/reptilian bodies (Josefina has a metallic implant and has 4 eggs in abdomen)\n1:26:14 Every specialist that came to Peru concluded that the bodies were in fact authentic and they\u2019re biological beings;

You moved huh\" while smiling creepily. I thought he was just a delivery guy that was trying to do small talk so I brushed him off. I am living alone so I thought I was just being overthinking by getting creeped out.\nThen I realized after I thought about it that he was my neighbor in my previous address. He striked up a conversation with me saying he knows one of my friends. I don't like talking to strangers so I didn't talk with him long but it stayed with me because I felt uncomfortable with him like I felt he was dangerous.\nAfter that, I was going out and I saw him again delivering to my neighbor and I ignored him trying to walk by. He saw me and recognized me even if I was wearing a mask and asked the same question again. After that since I don't go out much I don't see him as often. There was this one time he was standing in front of my neighbor's house but I just walked by.\nThen I saw him in my Facebook friend requests and I just ignored him again but I was obviously creeped out so I told my friend that he said he knew. At first my friend said she doesn't know anyone with that name but his last name made her recognize him as a son of a family friend. They never talked. His family didn't know he was working as a delivery guy and he was laid off because he became obsessed with his boss which was older than his mom.\nI also lost my keys so I asked my landlord for replacement. I didn't think much of it until I got home to my door open. Obviously I was cautious but there was no one at my apartment so I sighed in relief thinking maybe I left it open. (I am nightshift so sometimes my mind is all over the place). Now that I am thinking about it I overlooked a lot of things and am thinking of installing a CCTV in front of my apartment. I am still scared though because he knows my address.\nUPDATE: \nMy friend told me to report him to the police but I'm too scared because they might just let him go and he'll take revenge on me. She also told me he might be doing drugs as told by his family since he is acting suspicious. The most I can do right now is change my locks and install a CCTV in front.

The first couple aren\u2019t all that special but the last one is a heavy topic for me.\nA couple months ago my friend told me that she was going on vacation out of state for a week with her boyfriend. Immediately after she told me, in my head I said to myself \u201cher boyfriend is going to propose\u201d and he did! I was actually going to write my \u201cprediction\u201d in the notes app to show her after the fact, but I never did. This one is easy to explain though, they\u2019ve been together for a couple of years now and going on vacation together to a place she loves would be the perfect time for him to propose.\nThis one was like 4 months ago. I had a feeling that one of my friends was going to block me. I kept checking to see if he was still on my friends list throughout the day. That same night, he blocked me everywhere. I don\u2019t know how to explain this one, but I can still try to write it off as a very strange coincidence. \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nNow, this one happened about 2 years ago and it\u2019s my uncles story, but it ties into mine. My mom had a stroke and was in an ambulance taking her to a helicopter to be life flighted. My uncle was on his way into town and my mom was in the ambulance going out of town at the same time. So they were on opposite sides of the road, and my uncle pulled over for the ambulance. As soon as the ambulance passed him, my uncle said he got the worst headache he\u2019s ever had and immediately thought of my mom. He didn\u2019t know she had a stroke at the time and didn\u2019t know she was the one in the ambulance.\nThe morning my mom had the stroke, I woke up with a feeling of impending doom. I could literally feel death. I was anxious the whole day, i could not stop panicking. My mom could sense that something was off with me, but I didn\u2019t even know what was wrong with me so I couldn\u2019t tell her anything other than I was stressed and didn\u2019t know why. My memory is foggy because this was a very traumatic day. I remember getting into her bed for the first time in years because it was the only thing that could bring me comfort. She left to go to the store and I remember wanting to tell her not to go. I was actually wanting to beg her not to but I didn\u2019t. I got a phone call some time after she left and found out that she had a hemorrhagic stroke. My moms heart stopped but they were able to bring her back. \nShe didn\u2019t have any health issues prior to this and nobody could see it coming. I told my family what I felt the day it happened and that\u2019s when I found out about my uncles experience. We were both able to sense that something was wrong with my mom. It was the strangest and most traumatic thing ever\nI think I got way ahead of myself here, sorry for the long post. I\u2019ve had lots of premonitions throughout my life but these are the ones on my mind right now.

The noise echoing through the halls, and before anyone could think, a kid ran down the hall screaming - \"he has a gun!!!!\" \nNow mind you, it was close to the end of the year, so sadly a lot of us thought it was a fucked up senior prank. The reason I say this is because, over the past few months we had kids apparently posting on Facebook that they were gonna shoot up the school. Therefore we had police officers in our classrooms, guarding us non-stop throughout the second semester. So when it actually happened, we didn't know if it was real or fake. \nOur security guard, who was previously a sniper in the military, ran down the hallway to see what was happening. Not even a minute later, he comes running back telling us to run, and we did. Kids were jumping over tables... They were jumping over each other and teachers were trying to pull kids into their classrooms. All hell broke loose the moment we realized, this meant life or death and all I could think about was, \"where's my sister?\" She had left for the bathroom moments before the first shots rang out and I remember not knowing what to do. Do I find her or do I hide because the gunman was coming right for me. So I ran.\nAs fast as I could, up the stairs and into my 4th period class. The teacher had sent a student out to see what was going on, and I rush us both inside telling him to lock the door. I remember everyone was staring at me, like what is going on? Are you ok? And that's when the principal got the intercom and I will never forget what he said:\n\"This is a code red, hide your students. I repeat, this is NOT A DRILL, hide your fucking students.\" \nI didn't even have to say a word, the senior class I ran into took action. They barricaded the door with desks and chairs after pulling in as many students as they could. The teacher told us to turn off all of our phone sounds, but to text our parents. When I did, my mom so happened to be right around the corner from the school. She raced over despite me telling her it wasn't safe. I felt like I could have gotten my mom killed that day and I still regret it though she remained safe. \nA lot after that is a blur. I remember my sister texting me that she was safe, but the gunman was trying to get into their classroom. I remember hearing the swat team clearing the hallways and hearing on one of their radios that their was multiple subjects, but none could be found. I remember seeing on multiple snapchats, teachers next to doors, ready to take action. Some had scissors, others had a bats and another showed students taking off their shoes, ready to attack anyone who entered without permission. Though being slightly wholesome, a school of people should never have to defend themselves against angry classmates with guns. That was something that should have never happened, especially on a day our guard was down. \nLong story short, we were in lockdown from 1:45pm to 10pm that night. The shooters were never found (as far as I know) and nobody was fatally injured. Thank God. \nWalking out though to see food and papers scattering the hallways was rough. We had to have our hands up in the air as we left the school, and before going outside, we were all patted down to make sure we didn't have weapons. My parents hugging me harder than before and me just being happy we all walked out to see another day. \nI dropped out of HS shortly after that and moved back to my hometown 5 states away. Lived with my brother for a bit until I got my own place, and that's when I met Devan. \nHe was like 3 years older than me, and I never realized he was my 1st grade crushes older brother, but there we were. He was pretty good friends with my brother and would hang out when we'd have kickbacks. Can't say he was a bad guy from what I saw and he never had beef with anyone. Super laid back stoner type guy. He was really cool, until we all got drunk one night and it slipped that he almost shot up his high school. Now, everyone there pretty much knew this about him, but played it off as \"well he didn't actually do it soooo\". Even my brother.\nI was disgusted when I told them what happened to me and they dropped him from the friend group pretty fast. Its just sad that it took me telling them I was actually involved in one to no longer be friends with him. Like people! You shouldn't of been friends with him to begin with. Wtf. Anyway, so I moved again and no longer talk to any of those \"friends\", including my brother and that's something I'm not sorry for. \nIt's been almost 10 years and I'm slowly moving on.

Now I\u2019m not scared to go outside of my house at night, even if we do live on the edge of town surrounded by cornfields and get coyotes in our yard all the time. It\u2019s something I\u2019m used to and learned to not be scared of it, so when I bring my dog outside, I always sit on our porch and wait for her to be done. It was around 12 at night when I decided to let my dog out so both her and I could go to bed. So I go outside in our front yard like normal and she walks off to go to the bathroom while I stand on the porch. She\u2019s kind of taking a long time to find a spot so I kinda just zone out while waiting for her. As I\u2019m looking at my neighbors house across the street and into their back yard, I hear this quiet whistling coming from down the street. I kind of brush it off and just think it\u2019s a wind chime, but in the back of my head I know none of my neighbors down that street have wind chimes nor was it windy out that night at all. So I kind of start getting anxious and call my dog up to go back into the house, but she starts to walk towards my neighbors house and her nose is up in the air like she\u2019s sniffing something. So I start yelling for her to come back in because she\u2019s far away now, when I hear another whistling sound. This time, it came from my neighbors back yard, or that general direction because I couldn\u2019t pinpoint where exactly, but it was way closer this time. The whistling was loud and urgent, is the way I would describe it. It was so loud that it startled me and my dog. At this point, I haven\u2019t seen anything in any of the surrounding area, so no physical source from where the whistling was coming from, and that second whistle happened about a minute after the first one. No possible way that whatever was whistling could come from down the street right into my neighbors back yard, especially since my neighbors have a pretty tall fence as well. And I know some people who weren\u2019t there to experience like I did might say it could\u2019ve been an animal, but it was a human whistle or sounded like a person whistling. So I frantically get my dog back into the house as she\u2019s trying to go towards where the whistling came from. \nAnd it doesn\u2019t end there, because the next night when I let her out again, I stayed inside as I watched my dog from the window. I lost sight of her so I walked out to the porch to bring her in, I called her name and soon after she came around back to me. I heard this rustling in our bushes and these weird animal sounds. Nothing like a coyote, nor do any of the coyotes in the area hide in our bushes or ever get that close to our house. I can\u2019t describe the sound, but it was quiet and didn\u2019t sound normal at all. It sounded like an animal whimpering in pain. It was deep sounding and quiet. I\u2019ve seen my fair share of horror movies and also live in an area that used to be Native American lands, so I just completely ignored it, grabbed my dog and went into the house all panicky. I went out the next morning to check for any wounded or dead animals in the bushes and found nothing. We also have stray cats in our area, but I\u2019ve heard a cat in pain before, and it sounded nothing like that. Along with the no physical evidence like blood, a wounded animal, or a dead animal, I was a little freaked out. So I refused to let my dog stay outside for too long while going to the bathroom, and I just stayed inside and watched her from the window up until my parents got home. \nThis still freaks me out till this day, and I remember panic calling a friend because the whistle startled me so much. Nobody really believes me but I know what I heard was not normal and I\u2019ve never had anything like that happen in the 18 years I\u2019ve lived in this house and spent my late nights outside by myself.", "media": null, "score": 10, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "comment_count": 0, "over_18": false}, "29": {"id": "17pi0pa", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ghosts", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "The-One-True-Bean", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1699687295.3708918, "created_utc": 1699317767.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/na3fana6otyb1.jpg", "title": "Came home after work to a handprint on my new mattress.. other strange happenings in my place recently as well (I live alone)", "permalink": "/r/Ghosts/comments/17pi0pa/came_home_after_work_to_a_handprint_on_my_new/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 3727, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "comment_count": 650, "over_18": false}, "30": {"id": "17rgo6m", "locked": false, "subreddit": "glitchinthematrix", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "I_am_a_freaky_possom", "link_flair_text": "Glitch Pic", "time": 1699687295.5959206, "created_utc": 1699546951.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/h1jhjklnlczb1.jpg", "title": "This window in the Cologne Cathedral looks like a glitch", "permalink": "/r/GlitchInTheMatrix/comments/17rgo6m/this_window_in_the_cologne_cathedral_looks_like_a/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 122, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comment_count": 6, "over_18": false}, "31": {"id": "17q0r2d", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ufo", "stickied": false, "category": "Aliens", "author": "Odd-Ad1714", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1699687297.1921837, "created_utc": 1699381439.0, "url": "https://thedebrief.org/nasa-shows-off-experimental-next-generation-advanced-electric-propulsion-system/", "title": "NASA Shows Off Experimental \u2018Next-Generation\u2019 Advanced Electric Propulsion System", "permalink": "/r/ufo/comments/17q0r2d/nasa_shows_off_experimental_nextgeneration/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 233, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comment_count": 36, "over_18": false}, "32": {"id": "17rt153", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ufos", "stickied": false, "category": "Aliens", "author": "tinosaladbar", "link_flair_text": "Video", "time": 1699687298.6832929, "created_utc": 1699580617.0, "url": "https://v.redd.it/gjpttumrdfzb1", "title": "The amendment to restore David Grusch's clearance has passed.

We started to talk on instagram and get to know each other. He was 19 years old and smoked the zaaa\ud83c\udf43 everyday. For me, it wasnt a red flag because I wanted to smoke for the first time (because my best friend camille told me that she would smoke with me but not make me smoke for the first time). We would call all day, everyday because I was getting interested in him. One day, he said that he could come over to my place and i planned to invite him when my parents would go on vacation, and I did. At first, we were both pretty shy, I was in front of a 6 feet tall men who seemed strong. We hugged and then we smoked in the garage. Then, my best friend camille came to check up on me as i told her to do earlier. Mik tried to impress her by talking about varieties of herbs he had and what their effects are. Camille seemed uninterested so Mik got up and changed the subject.\n-Do you think I can lift you up? He said\n-I dont think youre strong enough to lift me up\n-Let me try.\n-No!\nHe went to pick her up even if she refused. She felt triggered by that and left. Now it was just me and him, he would talk about how he went to prison because some girl said he raped her, to me, 14 year old girl whos stuck with him in my house. We smoked again and the night went by. The next morning, we both woke up to camille calling me. She asked me if she could come and I said yes, because i was to scared of him.  She arrived 10min later, we both ate and were ready to welcome her. We smoked again and then me and camille would talk together, leaving mik out. When camille went to the washroom, Mik said he would steal her grinder because he liked it, which made me uncomfortable. I told him not to steal it and he left it there. Then he asked me if i wanted to go to his house, in montreal. I declined the offer because i had school the next day. She came back, and I told her, but without mik knowing i told her. Me and Camille have a secret language that we both learned when we were younger and we now use it to tell each other secrets in front of others. Then, out of no where, i felt weird around him and then i forgot everything. Ten minutes later, I ask camille where he went, because i was stoned and forgot, and she told me that i kicked him out saying he really needed to call his taxi not to be late and that I was really tired and sick, which was probably because of that bad feeling i got. And ive never seen him again.\n\u200b\nA few months later, police officers come see me and ask me questions about him, which conserns me. Apparently, he went to prison for multiple rapes, murder attempt and for drugs dealing. Also, he wasnt 19, he was more of 25-30years old and had a brother who prostitutes teenagers. Luckily, i didnt went with him to montreal.

From my understanding, this is the only officially acknowledged UFO incident by the Finnish military/government.\nhttps://theufodatabase.com/videos/finnish-air-force-pori-ufo\nhttps://www.is.fi/kotimaa/art-2000000502183.html\nhttps://yle.fi/a/3-5971507\nOn April 12, 1969, during a Fouga Magister jet training mission at Pori Airport, a flight controller from the Finnish Defence Forces instructed trainee pilot Tarmo Tukeva to check out seven air balloons hovering about 1500-3000 meters above the airport. Upon inspection, Tukeva described the objects as ball or disc-shaped, although he was unable to determine his distance from them. He noted that the objects darted away \"at great speed\" when he approached. Not only that but, within a minute they were again spotted on radar at Vaasa airport - almost 200 kilometers farther north. Another pilot-in-training, Jouko Kuronen, mentioned that he caught the radio exchanges between the flight controller and Tukeva, and also spotted the objects. The Finnish Armed Forces magazine Ruotuv\u00e4ki drew parallels between the April 12 observations and other instances over water bodies during active military drills, speculating that these might have been \"transnational spy planes or aircraft.\"\nWhat I find odd about trying to explain these away as spy planes or balloons, is that when they were first observed they were hovering and only upon being approached by Tukeva did they maneuver away. So they seemed to recognize his approach and made an intelligent decision to avoid him. Not only that, they were seen at 1500-3000 feet which seems extremely low for a spy plane. This explanation doesn\u2019t make sense at all.\nThe plane that was sent to intercept them was traveling at approx. 700kph but couldn\u2019t even get close to them. For these objects to go from basically stationary to well beyond the plane's speed, allegedly traveling 200km in 60 seconds, this would be a technology we aren\u2019t familiar with or capable of.\nWhy is this the only official UFO incident that the Finnish government acknowledges? If there was one, certainly there have been more.\nI\u2019m surprised there isn\u2019t more about this incident from official/unofficial sources.

I had just lost my job at McDonalds due to a massive flood taking out a lot of businesses in my area and I had a girlfriend that lived 30 minutes away and I needed gas money so I took a job offered to me by a family friend at a 24/7 gas station in the next town over from mine. The shift I was hired for was 11pm-7am, and I had never worked a night shift in my life, but I thought it would be pretty cool to have little to no pressure other than to make sure the coffee was ready at 4 AM for the morning regulars. I was required to train on day shift for the first couple of weeks to get accustomed to the operations. Throughout those weeks I learned many of the ins and outs of what takes place on night shift and I also learned the ins and outs of the people that hung around the place for hours. And there were quite a few. One woman in particular, Melinda, would come in every morning before and after dropping her kids at school, around lunch time sometimes actually buying us lunch, and in the evenings when her husband was home, she came for hours considering she lived a couple streets over. She was nice and I started to enjoy her visits and we all got along so well in the store. It was a fun atmosphere for the most part. So it\u2019s finally time for me to work night shift and I had my manager with me for a few nights, I was taking her place on night shift because she couldn\u2019t do it anymore. She was nice, and I admit I had a pretty big crush on her so I didn\u2019t mind spending the time with her all night. And I learned when she worked night shift, Melinda spent the entire night there. \n   I had been working night shift alone for a couple weeks, and some of those night shifts drug in into the days when we were short staffed but again I needed the money. Anyway, one night I was doing my \u201cchores\u201d scrubbing the hot dog rollers, setting coffee filters up for the rush, and mopping the entire store. While emptying my mop bucket I heard the chime of the door and looked at my watch and saw it was 2am which was odd, there typically wasn\u2019t anyone coming into the store until 4 consistently and I was a little upset because I had JUST mopped that floor. But I went out to see who it was, just as I headed out,  the movement in the mirror overhead to \u201cstop shoplifters\u201d caught my eye. There was a man at the counter doing something with the money order machine, and upon looking again, he had a knife. He was cutting the wires! For what reason I have no clue. While he was cutting I heard him muttering, where\u2019s Bonka, over and over again. I knew I could walk back and get to the phone in the office but I didn\u2019t want him to hear me so I pulled my phone out and texted Melinda to call the cops and tried to text quickly as much of what I could describe. She told me she would be right down and I was freaking out with every second that passed. Before she could get there the man went outside to the gas pumps and threw all of the trash cans and started to try and cut through the gas lines! I took this opportunity to lock the front door in case he tried to get back in, and thank god I did because he immediately made a B line to the door and slammed his fists into it. Just as he did, the cops and Melinda showed up and he was put into the cop car while I explained everything that had just happened. Turns out \u201cBonka\u201d was the name he called my manager, who\u2019s name was Bianca. He had become obsessed with her in the weeks prior, dropping in nightly and making her very uncomfortable. Which explains why she couldn\u2019t take it anymore. They knowingly threw a timid 19 year old into this mess and seeing me there instead of her, was what turned his obsession into rage. So to the man that became extremely unhinged when they took a woman out of a potentially dangerous situation, and the women that threw a naive teenager into his world, let\u2019s never meet again.", "media": null, "score": 129, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "comment_count": 15, "over_18": true}, "54": {"id": "17qplfj", "locked": false, "subreddit": "truecreepy", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "zenona_motyl", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1699687316.0063224, "created_utc": 1699461398.0, "url": "https://anomalien.com/the-gruesome-story-of-carl-tanzler-and-his-corp", "title": "The Gruesome Story of Carl Tanzler and His Corpse Bride", "permalink": "/r/truecreepy/comments/17qplfj/the_gruesome_story_of_carl_tanzler_and_his_corpse/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "comment_count": 0, "over_18": false}, "55": {"id": "17sg7t7", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ghosts", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Minato299792458", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1699687317.098498, "created_utc": 1699656815.0, "url": "https://v.redd.it/jri1uzwbolzb1", "title": "Was home alone pooping when I heard someone say my name.", "permalink": "/r/Ghosts/comments/17sg7t7/was_home_alone_pooping_when_i_heard_someone_say/", "selftext": "First sorry for the mess. \nSecond, I don\u2019t know how to make the audio clearer or turn my dogs claws on the hard floor down.

Now, we have interviewed a whole range of people, over 30 people now. I think we've interviewed most of the people that he may have talked to, but we don't know that. And we have extended an invitation at least four or five times now for him to come in over the last eight months or so and has been declined.\"\n\nNewsNation reached out to David Grusch to clarify his perspective, who stated: \n\n\"I have zero emails or calls from them. That is a lie.\"\n\n\u200b\nNovember 2nd \u2013 UAP spotted over Arctic Circle days before Chinese spy balloon\nOn February 1st \u2013 three days before a Chinese spy balloon appeared over the U.S. \u2013 an unidentified object was seen over the Arctic Circle, with fighter jets being sent to take the object down, sources told NewsNation.\nThe defense and intelligence sources said 8-9 UAPs were detected over the Arctic Circle, and fighter jets were sent up in an unsuccessful attempt to intercept them.\nNORAD admitted it had aircraft flying in the area but that they were returning to home bases as part of a training operation.\n\u200b\nNovember 3rd \u2013 Pentagon UFO chief Dr Sean Kirkpatrick will reportedly be replaced by the end of the year\nAccording to sources that spoke to the DailyMail, a candidate 'short list' to replace Dr. Kirkpatrick at the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) has been interviewed.\n\n'He's out at the end of the year \u2014 and that's a big deal'  \nDaniel Sheehan told the Dailymail.\n\n\u200b\nNovember 4th \u2013 Rep. Luna affirms Members of Congress will be able to view Grusch's Inspector General report\nRep. Luna took to Twitter to confirm \u2013 \"We received permission from Grusch to read his IG report. So, looks like it\u2019s back to the SCIF.\"\n\u200b\nNovember 5th \u2013 Pentagon UAP Spokesperson confirms a previously reported 'transmedium' UAP incident has been resolved & details will be shared with the public soon\n\n\u201cPreviously reported transmedium object has been resolved and the case details are being prepared for public release in the near future.\u201d \nSue Gough, DoD UAP Spokesperson.\n\nVia Liberation Times.\n\u200b\n---\nThings to look out for in the near future:\nNovember\n\nAccording to Senator Gillibrand \u2013 a public hearing in line with AARO's latest report can be expected soon, saying \u2013\"I'll probably have another hearing aligned with that public report.\u201d\nOn November 15th, the Hayden Center is hosting an event \u2013 UAP: The Search For Clarity \u2013 with AARO's lead Dr. Kirkpatrick as the main guest. The hosts have confirmed they will also be taking questions from the in-person/virtual audience. You can register for the event here.\nMembers of Congress will be discussing UAP-related matters in a SCIF with the Intelligence Community Inspector General on the 16th of November\nThe SOL Foundation is holding its first annual conference at Stanford University on November 17-19, 2023. Covering everything from the scientific study of UAP data to philosophical questions raised by it to related global security issues, the meeting brings together Avi Loeb, Charles McCullough, Cristopher Mellon, Garry Nolan, Jacques Vall\u00e9e, and other leading academic and government voices on UAP.\n\n\u200b\nBeyond/currently unknown\n\nWhile the US Senate passed the NDAA for FY24 \u2013 which included the UAP Disclosure Act of 2023 as an amendment \u2013 the coming months will still require Senators and Members of Congress to reconcile the two chambers\u2019 versions of the NDAA and produce a final compromise bill. Most commentators don't expect this to happen before December 2023.\nFollowing the UAP hearing on the 26th of July, Members of Congress have called for a select committee with subpoena authority, to \u201cgo about the task of collecting information from the Pentagon and elsewhere\u201d on unidentified flying objects. There have been conflicting messages from various Members of Congress on whether this is likely to happen anytime soon.\nReps. Moskowitz, Luna, and Burchett have repeatedly stated their intent to hold field hearings to overcome stonewalling from the Pentagon and military establishment \u2013 \"I think we [Congress] should try to get into one of these places [housing UAP evidence]...and if they won't let us in I think we should have a field hearing right outside the building...and the military will have to explain why that is.\" \u2013 Rep. Moskowitz (D). It is currently unknown when we might expect that to occur.\nSeveral journalists have indicated that first-hand witnesses of the alleged UAP legacy programs are in the process of providing testimony/evidence to the relevant authorities (e.g. the IC IG) and/or are on the verge of making public statements in the near future (Example 1, example 2, example 3, example 4)\n\nReminder \u2013\u00a0Call your Reps!\nVarious members of congress will be deliberating key UAP legislation in the next days/weeks, so I put together a list of names, emails, & numbers (+ handy scripts/templates) in one easy place for reference.\nIf you have the time, please do call/contact these reps & remind them sunlight is the best disinfectant! In my opinion, it's especially important that we voice our support for Senator Schumer/Rounds' UAP Disclosure Act legislation, which is (in my opinion) a great first step towards furthering UAP transparency as a whole.\n--------\nSkimmed through this post but need a quick refresher on how we got to this point?

Everyone has warned me how dangerous this area can be and to be vigilant, I carry pepper spray. I've never had any issues, til tonight. \nI ride the fast transit train system often. Usually at least a few times a week. To get there from my apartment I have to walk about a mile, most of which is an enclosed trail that runs behind a neighborhood and next to the train tracks. There's one entrance on one end, one in the middle, and the other end opens up to the train station parking lot. \nLast week as I was walking home around 10pm, I had to walk past a man who was pretty obviously homeless. It seemed like he was looking for something he lost, and talking to himself. I had to walk past him to get home. So I try to just put my head down and quickly walk past. He blocks my way saying \"excuse me! Hey! Did you see this thing about this big... (Gestures with his hands) when you were walking through here?\" Confused I say \"no, sorry. \" and hurriedly walk away. I can hear him trying to talk more to me but I kept going and he luckily didn't follow. A few days later I encountered him again on the same trail and he tried to talk to me again but I just said \"sorry I don't know what you're talking about\" and kept going. Well tonight I walk into the train station and hes coming out of the elevator as I'm going down the escalator, and starts yelling at me \"excuse me, wait, ma'am! \" I ignore him but he follows and won't leave me alone so I turn around and say \"what?!\" He says \"hey did you see my speaker? You know since you were on the trail that night? \" I tell him no, I don't know what you're talking about. He then says \"well can I just look in your back back real quick then cause you looking really guilty right now. \" I tell him no and he gets mad and takes a step towards me so I pull out my pepper spray and tell him \"leave me alone or I will pepper spray you\" he starts yelling about how he doesn't care and how I better not have his shit but he walks away. I walk to the far end of the platform away from him and call my roommate and tell her whats happening. Thats when the guy walks up holding a hatchet that he tries to hide under his jacket and I hold up my pepper spray and stand up and tell him to back the fuck up cause I'm not playing around. He puts his hands up and backs away. My roommate calls the transit Police for me. I can hear the guy screaming somewhere upstairs in the station. Luckily my train pulled up right then and I hopped on. \nReally hoping to never meet hatchet guy again, and for the last time, no I don't have your fucking speaker.", "media": null, "score": 62, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comment_count": 1, "over_18": true}, "67": {"id": "17ri8bi", "locked": false, "subreddit": "truecreepy", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "duchess_of-darkness", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1699687327.0386922, "created_utc": 1699551041.0, "url": "https://youtu.be/Y5wGSMh1g4M?si=VpBH8FVJXP-GQrML", "title": "The Cult on Devil's Road...author unknown #scaryplace", "permalink": "/r/truecreepy/comments/17ri8bi/the_cult_on_devils_roadauthor_unknown_scaryplace/", "selftext": "", "media": {"type": "youtube.com", "oembed": {"provider_url": "https://www.youtube.com/", "version": "1.0", "title": "The Cult on Devil's Road...author unknown   #scaryplace", "type": "video", "thumbnail_width": 480, "height": 200, "width": 356, "html": "<iframe width=\"356\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y5wGSMh1g4M?feature=oembed&enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen title=\"The Cult on Devil&#39;s Road...author unknown   #scaryplace\"></iframe>", "author_name": "Duchess of Darkness", "provider_name": "YouTube", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y5wGSMh1g4M/hqdefault.jpg", "thumbnail_height": 360, "author_url": "https://www.youtube.com/@duchessofdarkness27"}}, "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "comment_count": 0, "over_18": false}, "68": {"id": "17p2ma0", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ghosts", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "I_am_a_MushroomHead", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1699687328.3958693, "created_utc": 1699276970.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/17p2ma0/crazy_night_we_heard_a_woman_screaming_in_our/", "title": "Crazy night - we heard a woman screaming in our house in the middle of the night.", "permalink": "/r/Ghosts/comments/17p2ma0/crazy_night_we_heard_a_woman_screaming_in_our/", "selftext": "My wife and I were dead asleep around 4:00 AM.
