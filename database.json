I'm not really into cryptozoology at all, but I'm curious if this is a common sighting, or what exactly my mother, father, and I experienced. \nThis was along route 66 going from Texas into New Mexico. We were heading to my great grandfathers funeral back in 2005 in the middle of the summer and I was ten at the time. The sun was starting to set, and I remember us talking, I'm eating a happy meal they bought me at the time and we were just swapping stories and having a good time, they made me this little cubby like area in the trunk for me to lay down in, color, etc. But most of the trip was spent just looking out the window, watching things pass by. \nWhile my parents were talking and the radio was on, I was just watching the world pass by, but I remember very clearly seeing a man standing and staring at cars, he wore a black trench coat, bowler or perhaps a top hat, a black beard, but the part I remember the most vividly was bright, glowing red eyes, I pointed it out to my mom who was distracted at the time, having not seen it. Well, a couple hours go by and I'm still looking out my window. I made a little game for myself to see if I could count how many birds I could spot along the way, and the sun was starting to set. Next thing I know, I see the same dude just ahead of us, but because of the dark, the eyes were a lot more intense, My mom got a little concerned about it and told my dad to speed up. \nEventually fatigue set in, and we found a rest stop, it was pitch black there, like. The kind of dark you can't even see your own feet in without a light, and we were all trying to sleep. I had to go to the bathroom and my dad walked out with me as I was rather freaked out from the sighting earlier, worried the guy would come grab me. As we got out of the car I remember my father staring off into the distance, and told me to hurry up, though keeping his usual calm demeanor. When I finished and got back into the car, he started it and we took off again, driving to stay in a motel instead. \nI asked him and my mother about it recently as we were reminiscing together about trips we've taken. When i asked my dad why he had us go to a motel he claimed it was because he saw the same pair of eyes staring at us from a hill near where we were, above a rocky outcrop. \nDoes anyone have any ideas or stories as to what exactly this could have been?  I remember the eyes so vividly, it's burned into my mind, as well as him being out in desert heat with a heavy trench coat and I'm not sure. My dad swears it was the devil, My mom thinks it was a Chupacabra of some sorts. I myself am not sure. Any thoughts would be appreciated, as I said this was over 19 years ago and I haven't seen anything since as I live far away from route 66 now.

What I could make out is the green oscillating (?) lights which swirled around it.

I did this full time for about 10 years. Doing a new case every few days for 10 years, you see a lot of weird shit. For example one time I saw drug dealers in a downtown city literally riding horseback. You see scary stuff too obviously if in bad neighborhoods etc  \nScariest encounter went down about 20 years ago.  This was a case in a somewhat rural area which were always the toughest.  You get there at 6am see what cars are in the vicinity and run plates to see if they match the person. Then mostly you watch for the registered vehicle to depart if you found one.  This place had one car in the driveway with no plates - which actually was quite unusual.  You are also provided an age/height/weight of the person and in rare cases a pic.  So I knew this was a guy in his mid 30s, average height and weight.\nFirst day it turned out he left before I got there. Protocol is if you can\u2019t confirm they are home by 10 am (4 hours onsite), you literally need to knock on their door to confirm if they are home. You usually pretend to be a UPS delivery in a costume and a dollar store item in an envelope with a clipboard. Surprisingly that works.  Anyways, no one was home. \nSecond day, came back at 5am - and low and behind a second vehicle was there, a truck - also with no plates. The dude came out around 530am and left.  I followed him but he was immediately wise and knew he was being followed which usually means they are up to no good I.e. working while collecting insurance disability money aka insurance fraud. I let him go while trying to be discreet about it. \nI came back the third day in another car which you also sometimes had to do.  This time he left again early and I successfully followed him to a farm in the neighboring rural hills.  \nIn short, i busted his ass on video doing heavy duty farm work for several hours. He eventually caught on and realized he was being watched.  I took off from my parked position and thought there was no way he could suddenly get off his tractor, run to his truck and get to me as there were driveways etc between us and also a creek. \nSomehow he was then a uddenly on my ass in his truck in some scary ass rural mountain roads.  I was scared shitless and kept driving and somehow I made it to the freeway. I had literally been lost in the mountains.\nOn the freeway, he followed me for miles and I couldn\u2019t shake him.  He would pull beside me at times and flex his arm and gesture pull over.  Dude was actually pretty scary looking and I had evidence on him that would cost him in more ways than one.\nI literally called 911 and reported a drunk driver endangering me, but was surprisingly told the officers were in between shifts and couldn\u2019t help.  There was an easy pass bridge about 20 miles up if I got that far, and at first I thought I could lose him there if he didn\u2019t have the easy pass, but then realized again he had no plates so wouldn\u2019t matter.\nAnyways, after many miles i finally was able to shake him, but he remained pretty close behind.  I exited the freeway and found a gas station- a cop was there and I reported this guy and his truck. The cop made a call and I didn\u2019t see this guy pull up. Shortly thereafter I gassed up my car and left and drove home and submitted my report. I\u2019m sure his free insurance money ended at the very least.\nScariest part actually is that i was worried this guy had my license plate and could run it somehow (as I was able to do for work) and locate where I live.  I began to research him online.  Sometimes in that line of work you learn the potential insurance fraud of the person you are following is the least of their criminal endeavors.  Well i learned this guy was a hardcore convicted felon who had been in federal prisons and was a gang member and hard drug user and dealer.  I was scared but nothing happened over the next few years and i eventually forgot about it.\nBut about 5 years later or so, i had a case in the same rural area again and thought about this guy.  I wanted to google him to see what the police blotters revealed about him in the last few years.  I googled him again and discovered he was actually dead.  I learned that a couple years prior, he had taken his girlfriend hostage with a gun, killed someone who tried to help her, then was killed himself by another person who actually saved her.

It was maybe 5 years ago.\nWe were somewhere between Missouri and California, coming from North Carolina and having gone thru Overland Park KS & Ogden, UT that afternoon- somewhere where there was a vast amount of flat, dry land with desert brush. Pulling off the highway and down an unmarked dirt road that seemed to go on for at least 2-3 miles, we came to a parking lot on our right, and some feet ahead there was a fence marked NO TRESSPASSING and a sign that said SPACE OBSERVATION and showed a military logo. I don't remember which part of the military it showed, but I remember thinking it was strange to see it partnered with space observation- perhaps the army or navy?\nThough I was scared of getting in trouble or worse, my husband pulled into the parking lot, which was relatively small and elongated. My husband pulled to the left far end of the parking lot and stopped the car. There was a fenced off entrance with a path that looked a bit like train tracks leading past another fence and up a small slop where a single story, small building was sitting next to a huge rocket. on the end of the parking lot directly opposite of us, a black car with shaded windows was sitting. When we pulled in,\nI didn't notice anyone, but after arguing about leaving with my husband for a second, I saw a man suddenly sitting in the back driver side of the vehicle. the front door on the same side was slightly ajar and the back door was wide open, and the guy was sitting and staring forward before he met eyes with me. he was only maybe 15-20 feet from us. His skin seemed a strange pink color in the streetlamp glow, his cheeks very angular and higher up than most people I've seen, and his eyes were darker and a lot larger than any humans, but not so large that you would notice if you quickly* glanced past them in a crowd. When he looked at me, my whole body felt like it was struck by lightning. my heartbeat sped, my eyes watered, I began hyperventilating and scrambling and ranting at my husband to GET THE F OUT OF HERE, NOW! My husband saw the car, but not the man right in front of us. He shrugged me off and proposed, seriously, that we explore. He liked to explore places that seem a little scary, as did I- but he was a conspiracy theorist with a deep distrust- a deep hate, even, of military and government. The fact he proposed this was maybe not so out of character if there wasn't a literal person right there, but this situation meant that proposal is WILDLY out of character for him. I have military family and pride myself on being a skeptic who likes to put facts where my mouth is- so you'd think my spouse would see my reaction as a huge reason to leave, as it was also out of character for me...My husband seemed to not see the man though he was sitting DIRECTLY across from us, and he tried to light heartedly argue his case for why we should check the facility out... He began to try and get out of the car, and I grabbed him hard and began to hysterically cry and beg to leave. He laughed at how ridiculous he thought I was being- aside from the other car and rocket, the place seemed like it was almost abandoned. Eventually he had no choice but to relent and began pulling out at what I painstakingly remember as incredibly slow speed. As we were turning onto the dirt road, the man got out of the vehicle and stood up, keeping his eyes locked with mine almost the entire event. I remember he was wearing a white tshirt and what looked like cargo shorts, but my memory could be slightly off by now.\nI've tried to forget about this and have tried to come up with reasons this was less than I thought it was, but recently a friend was spouting some conspiracy hogwash that reminded me of this story. Pushing it out of my head so long, I'm struggling to find the area we were at, turning up no good results searching bases belonging to the military tasked with space observation or research.\nI can't find the long road with the fence and the parking lot with the track-like-path and a rocket next to a small facility. I've considered it's a secret base, but I've run out of ideas to figure out where to find names of secret bases in the area. I want to find the area so I can see if anyone else had this or a similar experience in the same place. Scariest, most rationality-defying experience I've ever had- I still get chills and butterflies when I think about it.\nSome facts I remembered after posting:\n\n\nThe man had mid-length black hair and incredibly sharp browbone.  \n\n\nThe longer road may have been unpaved/ a well-traveled dirt road.  \n\n\nThere was a town close by, I remember seeing a 1st street and driving over a railroad track afterwards.  \n\n\nThe largest sign was the one at the beginning of the right-turn into the short paved way up to the fence and parking lot. It was brown (I am pretty sure) or another dark color. It specified \"Space\" and another word like \"observation\" or \"research\".   \n\n\nThe military branch named on the big sign was one I thought was uncommon to be a branch with duties regarding space (at the time- now I understand all major branches do). May have been navy or army.   \n\n\nThe gate directly ahead of the paved way was closed with a small sign on it that said NO TRESSPASSING.  \n\n\nThe entrance in the parking lot looked to be made of concrete with a roof above it and a space for a guard to mind the gate, and was more open on the other side- sort of like a light rail/caltrain platform.  \n\n\nThe path or tracks below/behind the platform led a very short distance and stopped many feet before the rocket area.  \n\n\nThe rocket was on a paved area directly to the right of the facility, possibly a little bit behind it.  \n\n\nWhen asking my late husband about it, he always shrugged it off and he claimed he didn't remember seeing anything and was forever disappointed I didn't let him explore.  If I said that he was right in front of the guy, he got a little upset and called my sanity in to question. \nFor this reason, I didn't talk about this for years.\n\n\nCrude map w\\/ obscure distancing showing the paved street after the long dirt road that led to the closed gate & parking lot. Building + Rocket were up a small hill and a bit further away from the gate than depicted. \nMy name is Zwayla Converse, I live in NC, USA.

There are no lies or alterations, i will describe what happened exactly. Im sharing this because i feel like the human brain, and maybe other areas of science need to be more advanced and explored. \nMy story begins when me, my father and my mother are watching a normal series on netflix between 9:30 and 10:00pm 11 feb 2024 GMT-3 if thats relevant. We were watching it, my mom got up and went to the bathroom, she could hear us fine, then there is a scene with people buckling up seatbelts on a helicopter, as my mom returns to sit in the sofa.\nMy father comments somethings like \"i dont get why they even bother to buckle up in this crap helicopter\" its not exactly what he said but its somewhat close in portuguese. The scene cuts to the front window of helicopter and i start to beguin to think of what model of the helicopter it is, i guess in my mind its a robinson. My mother is standing in the dark staring at me. \nNote i didnt say anything about any helicopter model at this point, only thought, she is not an aviation fan so she doesnt know anything about what a robinson is. So she says she had a \"dejavu\" (look it up, idk how to translate its sort of when you think you see the future in a present tense memory like moment) basically she says that she realized she entered a dejavu when my father talked about the buckling, and then expected me to say \"oh this is the robinson helicopter isnt it\" but i didnt say because my thought process was disrupted by her staring at me in the dark which is weird. \nEither way she basically read my mind, there is no possible way she could possibly ever guess i was about to confirm with my father about a specific model of helicopter. This PROVES we humans somehow can view the short term future.\nBasically she realizing what was about to happen altered the reality into she staring into me waiting for me to actually say what i was about to say, then disrupting my thought process because she was staring at me in the dark, i thought \"wtf why is she just stopped there staring at me\" instead of whatever thought i would have concluded THIS IS ABSRURDLY CRAZY.\nWhat i can possible associate this is with the double slit experiment with quantum physics. Where one observer observes, collapsing realty into one state vs another. \nMaybe thats the foundation into finding out what counciousness is, or simply understanding more quantum physics relation with the brain, or the network of brains... please dont hesitate to contact me for any clarification. \nMaybe we can somehow develop a natural (without neuralink) telepathy or time travel related stuff... i know it sounds cringe but only me and her truly know what happened. That is legit crazy. I hope someone important sees this.

I\u2019ve only told it to a few people, but I definitely feel like it deserves its place in here. It\u2019s for sure one of the scariest moments I\u2019ve ever had as a child.\nBack when I was around 10 years old my mom finally decided that it was time for her to start taking her drivers license. When she began taking lessons she was struggling a lot. For that reason my dad decided that he wanted to do some practice with her besides the official driving lessons with her instructor - just to make sure that she\u2019d pass the upcoming test first try. \nMy little brother and I were attending swimming lessons at this nearby university at the time. Behind a forested area near the university lays this huge student parking area surrounded by trees which turned out to be basically empty every weekend. My dad saw the opportunity to take my mom here to drive around for a bit, and brought my little brother and I with them since we were too young to stay home alone. We brought a football with us.\nWhen we arrived to the parking lot later on in the evening my parents began their practice. My little brother and I quickly got bored though and asked if we could go over to this little grass field on the side of the parking lot to play some football. My parents let us since they\u2019d always be able to keep their eyes on us whilst driving around. After playing for some time my parents ended up driving around in the other end of the parking lot. They were approximately 300-400 metres away from my brother and I. \nSuddenly this white Toyota pulls into the parking lot. We were playing almost right at the exit/entrance. The car turns around and stops on my right side with the vehicle facing the exit. The driver rolls down his windows and presents himself as Thomas. He looked friendly, was good looking and young (a guess would be around 30). This is where things started to get weird. On the passenger seat was a woman covering her face with a newspaper. All I could see was long blonde hair. And on the backseat was a baby sat in a baby chair. \u201cThomas\u201d immediately states that he\u2019s from the police, and that we have to get in the car immediately as he has to talk to us. My brother actually took two steps towards the vehicle but I stuck my arm in front of his chest as I was sensing something was off. The woman was still covering her face at this point not saying a word. \u201cThomas\u201d then raised his voice and told us once again to get in the car or else he\u2019d have to come out and get us. My brother and I froze out of fear. Suddenly the woman put down the newspaper, showed her face and told us in the most calm motherly voice to \u201cjust listen to the man\u201d. The woman looked young, pretty and like a person who wouldn't hurt a fly. At this moment I began screaming as loud as I could. \nWhat we hadn\u2019t seen at that point was that my dad was already running as fast as he could towards us.  He was coming from behind the vehicle so we didn\u2019t see it. My parents didn\u2019t have time to drive to us since the road down the parking lot was twisted all the way. When my dad heard my scream he started yelling as loud as he could \u201cHEY WHO THE F ARE YOU GET THE F AWAY FROM MY CHILDREN\u201d. As soon as Thomas heard my dad and realised my brother and I weren't alone he threw his car into gear and took off as fast as he could. He most definitely looked like a person who shat himself when he saw my dad. \nMy dad was furious and told my brother and I to hurry up back to the car. He didn't even think about calling the police at that point. He wanted to beat up the guy himself. That resulted in us driving around for the next hour trying to find him before my dad cooled down and decided that he should probably just call the police. \nWe never found out who these people were. But this episode taught me to never judge a book by its cover. People can be the most friendly looking people in the world and still wish evil upon you or the ones you love. Im not sure what these people would've done to us. I am sure about one thing though.

In USA, Virginia, near the George Washington National Forest. It started off as a normal night driving around backroads blasting music just hanging out catching up with a friend when we pulled up to a sharp turn and as soon as we started slowing down i noticed something standing behind a tree at the turn. Its eyes were green and glowing but when the lights from the car illuminated the tree, the figure stayed black its eyes being the only thing glowing. Almost like way light hits an object and is supposed to bounce off didnt workon its body. It was just like the light gets pulled into just darkness not skin. Like vanta black but alive. At first i thought it was a deer but this is a gravel road where the treeline starts almost at the edge of the gravel and when we got closer i noticed this thing was tall. Im not sure if it had antlers or it was just the branches without leaves but Im 6 foot 2 and this thing was as tall as me or maybe even taller. I didnt say a damn thing bc i thought i was just still high asf or something. Well my friend took the turn slow, bc it was basically a right angle, and then stopped. When she stopped in the middle of the road she turned the music off n asked \u201cdid you see that?\u201d I said \u201cyeah i thought it was a deer but it looked way to big to be one\u201d she said she was thinking the same thing. So she started looking for her flashlight while i grabbed the baseball bat from her back seat. We got out n it had to have been at most 2 minutes that passed since we stopped n got out. We walked to the same tree we thought we saw this thing and didnt see anyone or anything. We looked around n nothing. The tree it was hiding behind was small. I mean if your a big guy it would barely cover your shoulders if you were trying to hide behind it and for sure not cover your belly, nose, or butt if u were standing alongside it. Well we got freaked out we didnt hear leaves rustling or sticks breaking from someone running so we got back in the car n left to the smoke spot for the night. Its just a pull off down the side of the same gravel road but a little ways down. We got out of the car and i started drinking again. When we heard what sounded like coyote howls and leaves rustling around us. So being dumb 20yr olds we just opened the doors from the car and turned the music on full blast to try n scare them away. I took a piss at the front of the car n when the music started blasting we started dancing together in front of the headlights, in my piss. We laughed about it n  had a good time. The whole time it felt like we were being watched, that feeling you get when someones staring at you was always there, but we didnt really care. I drew the picture at work the next day n sent it to her n she said it kinda does look like it but she doesnt wanna talk about it anymore. I still dont know what it was but im glad she was sober bc i thought i was just high n seeing shit. -2024, January She lives near there and says she hasnt seen it again but later on in the winter we went sledding at night (we work night shift so we usually do random shit in the dead of night) near her house and when we were walking down a trail to get to a bigger hill we heard loud bangs like a door being slammed open and shut. There was a full moon with snow on the floor so you could still see really well at night n there was a house on top of the hill I noticed when i looked up. So i asked her if she thinks her neighbors are mad. Well then she told me that her neighbor had died recently and that no one lives in that house now. So we walked back to her place and just kept sledding there instead.

So I was sent here! I found this subreddit and figured I\u2019d post it here as well in case anyone else had anything similar happen?  This took place about a year ago. (At the time I wrote this)\nI\u2019ve had a weird one that stuck with me for a while I don\u2019t really know how to make sense of it but I honestly have accepted I\u2019m not going to be able to figure it out.\nNormal day at home on my day off. I just bought my house like 3 months ago and was still getting used to it. I sat down on my sectional in the living room watching tv, (I just made some clam chowder literally my favorite) and set it in front of me while I put on South Park since it\u2019s my comfort show and this was probably around Noon. It was bright out and the house was lit up through the blinds. This is where I get goosebumps. I can\u2019t for the life of me remember what happened next. It was 7:42 pm. It was like a snap of someone\u2019s fingers and the world moved on without me. South Park was still on, definitely not near the episode I started on which was the episode about yelpers, and my food was still untouched where I left it. I just wasn\u2019t sitting up anymore I was laying on the couch in front of my fireplace. I NEVER lay there I usually use it to sit and tie my shoes before I head out. I can\u2019t really explain the feeling but I\u2019d say there was an immense raw sense of fear that came over me because I couldn\u2019t figure out where the time went or what happened. There were no pieces to put together. Besides that I just felt kind of sick, and out of body which I kind of attributed to how worked up I got.  Never happened to me before, has not  happened since. No history of anything like that in the family. Truly at a loss for that one. To make myself feel better I reheated the clam chowder and ate it though.\nSome answers to things that were asked:\nI installed a carbon monoxide detector shortly after I bought the house, it wasn\u2019t that.\nWhen I woke up, besides the general feeling I had, there were marks on my foot, like it was tied up in a wire thread, but the marks didn\u2019t last last the next day\nThere is no history of any epilepsy or black outs in the family\nAfter this I experienced shivers in my spine. Not painful, but at random times is felt like the center of my spine would get cold and it would shoot up and down the length of my back and give my whole body goosebumps. This still happens to me now, but nowhere near as often as when this happened \nI had missed calls and texts, but I didn\u2019t text or call anyone while I was \u201cmissing?\u201d \nThat couch is super uncomfortable. I hate it it\u2019s just to put things on. I have an awesome sectional that I can\u2019t get enough of. No idea why I\u2019d randomly wake up on the couch. I would never do it to begin with, I wouldn\u2019t even let a puppy sleep on it. \nFeel free to ask anything else.", "media": null, "score": 27, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "comment_count": 11, "over_18": false}, "44": {"id": "1bmu80n", "locked": false, "subreddit": "letsnotmeet", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "fortunesoulx", "link_flair_text": "Mod Post", "time": 1711775714.2621927, "created_utc": 1711311249.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1bmu80n/quick_update_on_moderation/", "title": "Quick update on moderation", "permalink": "/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1bmu80n/quick_update_on_moderation/", "selftext": "Hi guys,\nI am trying to keep up as usual with reports and checking the sub once or twice a day, but not only am I in the process of moving, I was involved in a car accident (just sitting at a red light waiting my damn turn, someone else got hit and spun out of control and into my car \ud83d\ude43) on Friday that has resulted in a lot of unexpected pain for me. \nPlease continue reporting posts that you think break the rules, and I will get around to them.

Suns, Galaxies, Planets are alive and possess an Intelligence,\u00a0which has, at times, incarnated in men, to speak to men, and help them in their evolution.\nThe new theology will eliminate rites\u00a0and the exaltation of religious concepts: they will be replaced by teaching concepts that will have to be put into practice directly in every manifestation of daily life.\u00a0\nFurthermore, it explains that the Universe is the paradise of Creation, and hell is everything negative that man chooses, by virtue of his free will, and that Purgatory is nothing other than the purification of the effects resulting from the causes generated by man.\nThe new theology will explain that man is intelligent, that his spirit is eternal, that\u00a0there is an eternal spiritual realm\u00a0[formerly: 'Heaven'], that death does not exist, that Life is eternal\u00a0and that the Spirit\u00a0evolves through the process of reincarnations.\u00a0For this reason, the intelligences that live and develop in the Universe are all brothers and sisters of us who live on this Planet, because we all, us and them, possess the Spirit.\u00a0\nThe new theology will not be divided between religions, but will unite all the races of this Planet in an agreement of brotherhood\u00a0and for thus, it is essential that\u00a0in the final phase of this century we become aware of the fundamental reality which shows us that\u00a0we are not alone in Universe; that Divine Intelligence created human\u00a0Life and spiritual\u00a0Life in other Galaxies; that contact with other civilizations would reverse\u00a0the crisis situation of this planet of ours\u00a0and would project humanity towards the establishment of a super civilization, without catastrophes and without profound crises. The change will have to occur by law of evolution; other Beings descended from the stars or from evolved Worlds will be sent by cosmic intelligence to help human evolution; Christ is the top/peak\u00a0of this pyramid of evolved Beings.\u00a0\nReligion is one, the message is one\u00a0and contains the absolute truth which is the original\u00a0content\u00a0of all the messages that have been given to man throughout the history of this Humanity. \nThe new theology will espouse science and they will be one; the scientist will develop technological processes for the benefit of the whole society, based on the \"Law of the spirit\", while the religious person will develop spiritual philosophy and its concepts that will merge with the development of technology. Thus\u00a0the new theology will teach that we are one thing with the being that lives inside us (soul, energy), that imbues us with its creating\u00a0and life-giving\u00a0Light. This Light is God, Love\u00a0and Justice, Omniscient and Omnipotent Light from which everything begins, and to which everything returns:\u00a0God.\u00a0\u00a0\nIt will therefore be taught that the Universes are the vital organs of this Cosmic Being, while Solar Systems and Planets are the cells of Its body and their Humanities (of Solar Systems and Planets) are its enzymes, which must elaborate and coordinate life on the cell. [cosmos=mystical body]\nIn the Cosmic being, or Macrocosm, there are, as in our body which is a microcosm, antibodies which are\u00a0highly evolved Beings, which know and obey the Divine Law and for this reason can circulate freely in it and process what is necessary for it, and eliminate what is harmful. No \u201cenzyme\u201d foreign to the cell is allowed to enter it if the former constitutes danger to the latter. In fact, even the cells of the Cosmic Being are equipped with their self-defenses and these are the four primordial elements of Creation (fire, air, water, earth), but also with self destruction, if necessary, to admonish the man.\nIt has been said: \u201cwhat is below is similar to what is above\u201d and again: \u201cknow yourself and you will know God\u201d.\nThis is the concept of the new theology.\"\u00a0 \u00a0                              [End of news article]", "media": null, "score": 152, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "comment_count": 94, "over_18": false}, "49": {"id": "1bm39y9", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ufos", "stickied": false, "category": "Aliens", "author": "TommyShelbyPFB", "link_flair_text": "News", "time": 1711775719.173304, "created_utc": 1711228807.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/h0l7h5mbh5qc1.jpeg", "title": "Former Nimitz Chief Radar Officer Kevin Day goes off on AARO and Kirkpatrick: \"They will not contact me or any other radar watchstander.

Theyre often described as a whiteman flying with some sort of appartatus and using high tech weaponry(Electric shock?) to subdue its victims. \nWhite men and electric guns: Analysing the Amazonian dystopia through Shipibo-Konibo children\u2019s drawings\nIn    Andean countries, the pishtaco is understood as a White-looking man    that steals Indigenous people\u2019s organs for money. In contemporary    Amazonia, the Shipibo-Konibo people describe the pishtaco as a high-tech    murderer, equipped with a sophisticated laser gun that injects    electricity inside a victim\u2019s body. This paper looks at this dystopia    through Shipibo-Konibo children\u2019s drawings, presenting composite    sketches of the pishtaco and maps of the village before and after an    attack. Children portrayed White men with syringes and electric guns as    weaponry, while discussing whether organ traffickers could also be    mestizos nowadays. Meanwhile, the comparison of children\u2019s maps before    and after the attack reveals that lit lampposts are paradoxically    perceived as a protection at night. The paper examines changing features    of pishtacos and the dual capacity of electricity present in   children\u2019s  drawings. It argues that children know about shifting racial   dynamics  in the village\u2019s history and recognise development\u2019s   oxymoron: the same  electricity that can be a weapon is also used as a   shield.\nIt    was the start of the rain season in Amazonia. A football match had   kept  the community lively after sunset, and people were slowly starting   to  return to their homes. Three gunshots echoed into the night \u2013 a   sign  that someone was in danger. The noise scared women and children   back  into their houses, while men armed themselves and headed to the   forest.  The victim was a 30-year-old Shipibo-Konibo man who worked as a   guard in  the community\u2019s lodge for gringos (White tourists, mostly   from Europe  and the US).1 He was heading for his night shift when he   felt a sudden  shock in his back and fell to the ground. As he looked   up, he found  himself surrounded by White men and fired the alert to the   village. He  managed to run towards the lodge, where he passed out.\nThe    victim was carried back to the community with a convulsive body    movement and dripping sweat. He felt electricity inside his body and    experienced shocks whenever he tried to drink water. Women fed him    highly sweetened milk instead, but his agony persisted. The community    then resorted to the local medical post, provided by the government with    Western medicine. The two nurses available declared that the victim\u2019s    vitals were normal and there were no signs of violence. Thus, they    treated the case as an anxiety crisis, applying a sedative that only    worked briefly. Distrusting the nurses\u2019 diagnosis and anxious about the    victim\u2019s condition, the community decided to transport the man to a    private clinic in Pucallpa, the nearest city. It was the only place with    sufficiently advanced technology to remove electricity from a  person\u2019s   body. After a few days in the hospital, the man was  discharged with no   clear diagnosis, an expensive bill and fully  recovered.\nI    was living in the village to research children\u2019s experiences of    development projects. Although I heard countless testimonies about    pishtacos, described by the Shipibo-Konibo as a White man who invaded    Indigenous villages at night to extract people\u2019s organs with electric    weapons, I struggled to fathom how such an operation could take place in    the middle of the forest. Nonetheless, the recurrence of those  stories   indicated the pervasiveness of this threat. Concerned about a   potential  network of organ trafficking, as those described by   Scheper-Hughes  (2000), I collected informal interviews of former   victims and  eyewitnesses, along with children\u2019s testimonies of the   above incident.  In this paper, I focus on the analysis of children\u2019s   drawings.\nThe    nature of my research led me to spend most of my time interacting  with   groups of children. As in other child-centred ethnographies  (Morelli,   2017; Schwartzman, 1978), play was a powerful research tool.  The   pishtaco appeared in games (for instance, in a version of catch  played   in the river), in drawings and in jokes about foreign people  that came   to the community. While I was attentive to these  occurrences, I   underestimated the importance of these stories in daily  life. In the   aftermath of the attack, I looked at the pishtaco  through a different   lens. That vivid experience, together with  children\u2019s illustrations,   made me grapple with the tangibility of this  rumour.\nIn    this paper, the images conjured by children\u2019s drawing give substance   to  these raiders and the repercussions of their attack. Based on  theory   about fantasy and imagination, I approach Shipibo-Konibo  children\u2019s   artwork as meaningful visual evidence. The analysis is  divided into two   sets of drawings: composite sketches of the pishtaco  and maps of the   village. Together, these sections offer perspectives,  respectively, from   before and after the attack. The ensuing  discussions incorporate   fieldnotes and other secondary data to  emphasise the history in the   stories (White, 2000) depicted in  children\u2019s art.\nResearchers    have long documented pishtaco stories among different Indigenous    nations in Andean countries (Oliver-Smith, 1969; Roe, 1988). However,    changes in testimonies, particularly regarding the murderer\u2019s    physiognomy and form of attack, impede his identification. The assassin    is mostly described as a tall, White doctor that eviscerates  Indigenous   people (Weismantel, 2001), although in Amazonia he has also  gained   mestizo features (Santos-Granero and Barclay, 2011). Older  reports of   his attack describe him as extracting the victim\u2019s fat to  produce an   ointment, which resonate with European medical practices at  the time of   invasion (De Pribyl, 2010). But in Amazonia pishtaco  attacks are also   filled with technological elements.2\nMethodology\nI    lived in Peruvian Amazonia from August 2019 to March 2020, when the    pandemic abruptly disrupted my research plans. To understand children\u2019s    experiences, my methodology consisted mostly of participant   observation,  which demanded an immersion in children\u2019s context   (Bluebond-Langner and  Korbin, 2007). I looked for a village that would   be willing to host me  for an extended period and in proximity to   children. My identity as a  Brazilian mestiza significantly affected   this process. Because the  village was close to Brazil, people had   questions about the fires in  Brazilian Amazonia upon my arrival and   were pleased by my position  against agribusiness. I was never mistaken   by a tourist and I was  expected to share women\u2019s responsibilities in   the household, which gave  me easy access to children of the kin. In a   communal assembly organised  by the chief to approve my stay, no one   opposed my interest in  children\u2019s lives; on the contrary, parents   expressed dissatisfaction  with children\u2019s education and asked me to   speak Spanish to the children,  for them \u2018to learn with me as well\u2019.3\nIn    my research, I was far from adopting the least-adult role (Mandell,    1988), but made efforts to learn from children (Mayall, 2000). An    important marker of this was attending the school as a student. From    Monday to Friday, I moved between classrooms of the primary school,    sitting among 53 students from ages 6 to 14 (although most of my time    was spent with students in the 9\u201312 age range, where my presence was    less disruptive). At school, children could mockingly assist me with    Shipibo lessons, and we drew and played together. I approached ludic    activities as strategies to develop rapport, but art also led my    research to unforeseen directions. After all, through drawings children    went beyond the visible or their lived experience to explore   fantastical  and future possibilities (Morelli, 2015).\nNoting    the importance of these encounters, I used the draw-and-tell  technique   (Driessnack, 2006; Van Leeuwen and Jewitt, 2011) to initiate  in-depth   conversations. Art served as a buffer to talk about  sensitive topics,   giving children freedom to direct, elaborate on and  limit conversations   (Marshall, 2013; Van Leeuwen and Jewitt, 2011). In  the \u2018momentary   stillness\u2019 that drawing requires, children left traces  of their   emotional and physical state, while juxtaposing present,  past and future   (Knight, 2013: 255). However, in the collaborative  drawings displayed   in this paper, the draw-and-tell method was  insightful because it   encompassed children\u2019s debates. These  co-creative processes can   contribute to expand the idea that  enculturation affects children\u2019s   artwork (Alland, 1983; Stokrocki,  1994), by paying special attention to   interactional processes in which  children\u2019s voices emerge (Spyrou,  2016)  and the negotiation of ideas  among peers.\nIn    order to safeguard the community, I did not disclose the village    location nor people\u2019s names. I only use a few pseudonyms to give    authorship to drawings when these were created by a small group of    children. Because composite sketches resulted from a lively debate    involving over 20 participants, I would not do justice to all    contributors if I restricted their authorship.\nComposite sketches of the pishtaco\nA    picture of the pishtaco appeared for the first time when I asked    children to draw scary things. Although this was an interesting    elicitation for my research purposes, at the time I proposed it as a    playful dare. This drawing session happened during a school break, when    children were organised by age group (9\u201312\u2009years old) and gender (as    they chose to divide themselves). They drew three pishtacos, two    chullachakis and several jaguars, but ascribed them different    categories: pishtacos are humans, chullachakis are spirits and jaguars    are animals (although some argued that jaguars also had spiritual    powers). The pishtaco lacks any spiritual dimension. Differently from    other threats, they are not in the depths of the jungle, but invade the    community\u2019s territory. In children\u2019s representations of the raider,   some  features were ubiquitous: they were all outlandish flying men.\nThis    first drawing (Figure 1) was produced by a group of girls after a    heated debate about the pishtaco\u2019s weapon, reported as a syringe    (although resembling a knife). The medical instrument alludes to his    allegiances with surgeons and indicate his covert tactics: children were    terrified of having their insides stolen by a needle in their sleep.    They claimed that this could be easily done through the holes between    floorboards, hence the importance of having beds or thick mattresses.    Hiding amid the stilts, the cunning murderer could crawl under  people\u2019s   homes and extract organs through an imperceptible skin  perforation.\nPishtacos acted    with the consent of the Peruvian government.  According to the    community, the State knows about the attacks and  profits from this    international trade. It was argued that indigenous  peoples\u2019 vital    organs helped pay off the country\u2019s external debt, a  suspicion also    voiced by other Amazonian peoples (Santos-Granero and Barclay, 2011).     Peru\u2019s growing interest in the extractives may underpin these   beliefs.   Apart from resulting in land disputes that favour the profit   of   foreigners, extractives trigger the widespread Amazonian   apprehension of   unregulated use of natural resources.\nThe    motorcycle in the above drawing is a flying vehicle. The children   chose  them over a speedy helicopter as the source of pishtacos\u2019 soaring    skills, adding that gringos provide mestizos with all sorts of   machines.  Various other Amazonian nations have spotted the murderer   travelling in  agile aircrafts (Santos-Granero and Barclay, 2011). While   in the first  sketch (Figure 1), children drew the pishtaco as a  winged  man, the  majority believed that he flew using some apparatus.  In the  sketch  below, a large group of children portrayed the killer  wearing  motorised  steel wings, which are attached to a full-body black  suit. In   combination with wheeled boots, the tentative jetpack offers   incredible  mobility (Figure 3). Testimonies of attacks usually  started  with the  victim perceiving polychromatic sparkles in the night  sky or  on top of a  tree, which emerged from the raider\u2019s night-vision  goggles.  Whatever  the pishtaco\u2019s floating mechanism was, it made him  nearly  invincible,  concealing his presence until he jumped for the  attack. The  sight of  these multicoloured lights was nearly a death  sentence.\nThe    three portraits show some consensus about the pishtaco\u2019s covert   tactics  of extraction, although with some variation. As described in   the  village\u2019s attack, pishtacos inject electricity inside their   victim\u2019s  body. This injection, previously drawn as a medical syringe   (Figure 1),  here gained a literal shape. It is a corriente, a Spanish   word that can  either mean metal chain (as in the drawing above) or   electric current.  The group of 12-year olds, who drew the mestizo   raider, mocked the chain  as a na\u00efve misrepresentation of a powerful   cutting-edge weapon.  Nonetheless, they did not disavow the role of   electricity in the  murders, for their mestizo killer is also armed with   a tiny and silent  laser gun. When shooting a corriente into his   victim\u2019s body, a pishtaco  leaves no trace.\nMapping electric light\nThe    white men with electric guns that invaded the community drastically    changed the daily dynamics in the village. In attempts to protect    itself, the community had frequent security assemblies, but those    meetings mainly expressed a ubiquitous feeling of vulnerability in face    of an invincible enemy. A few preventive strategies came into place.   The  street went quieter and people only walked in groups. Men organised    themselves into ceaseless patrols of the community\u2019s borders. If they    already wore rifles when crossing through the forest, now they hiked    heavily armed. Darkness made the village particularly cautious, since    attacks happen at night. People returned to their houses as soon as  the   sun went down and children\u2019s visits to my porch, that typically  took   place at sunset, became rarer.\nIn    these odd days, I flipped through my sketch notebook and reflected    about the pishtaco. Among the other common themes in children\u2019s    drawings, one caught my attention. In the many depictions of the    village, I was intrigued by the size and frequency of lampposts (Figure    4).\nLampposts    were seldom lit in the community. The government did not  provide    electricity to the village and thus the availability of energy  depended    on people\u2019s income. Petrol was costly and ended quickly,  lasting  only   for a couple of hours. Nobody knew exactly which night of  the  week   would be illuminated, as it depended on the import of gasoline   from   Pucallpa, but the arrival of petrol was communicated in a buzz.     Electricity was necessary for the phones and lanterns that people     depended on during the week. When lampposts suddenly lit, people ran to     charge their equipment.\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eft9nmavx9rc1.jpg?width=772&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=12d73caf232e91b166993786140f8a696380b100\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yt9hwpavx9rc1.jpg?width=1342&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bef1de36fd62ad0c6cbe338dcfc97edb06c113b6\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5q0jmoavx9rc1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dedc85abd197314bf0c052864c3124d7d3849786\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vxrppuxvx9rc1.jpg?width=818&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4e8c6a6bd76b18736d464c0ab2f35b7358958554\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pm8c7wxvx9rc1.jpg?width=1357&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=94f7da83484023f9dc6517b4abb522d23476e45a\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fzdqxxxvx9rc1.jpg?width=1342&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aa9bcdce420d29263403268b3ca2a5cf011cad7e\n\u200b", "media": null, "score": 20, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "comment_count": 3, "over_18": false}, "57": {"id": "1bmfjsv", "locked": false, "subreddit": "cryptids", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "tavernofterrors", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1711775725.3223407, "created_utc": 1711267359.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/adlvjgcgo8qc1.jpeg", "title": "while we\u2019re talking about mothman\u2019s butt, don\u2019t lick the it either", "permalink": "/r/cryptids/comments/1bmfjsv/while_were_talking_about_mothmans_butt_dont_lick/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 224, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "comment_count": 66, "over_18": false}, "58": {"id": "1bnmnyt", "locked": false, "subreddit": "thetruthishere", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "ArielandFlounder1983", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1711775725.5608504, "created_utc": 1711395314.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1bnmnyt/beings/", "title": "Beings", "permalink": "/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1bnmnyt/beings/", "selftext": "In 2020 I was living in a half way house and out of my 7th rehab, I had lost everything I loved the previous year and was continually being emotionally abused by my exhusband.

In the heart of this narrative stands a French scientist, pseudonymously known as \"Mr. L,\" whose account blends the realms of advanced biology with the shadowy world of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and potential extraterrestrial life forms.\n\"Mr. L,\" a distinguished figure in the scientific community, associated with the likes of Nobel laureates Lwoff, Monod, and Jacob, was reportedly summoned to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB) in Ohio. His mission was to conduct an analysis on two unusual beings, characterized by their towering stature and unique physiological traits, which hinted at origins beyond our common understanding. These beings, standing over 7 feet tall, exhibited features such as elongated blonde hair, high foreheads, and an unusual eye structure reminiscent of Asian descent, coupled with a lack of standard human skin and circulatory components.\nThis event is set against the backdrop of WPAFB's storied history as a hub for aerospace research and development, with a particular focus on foreign and potentially extraterrestrial technologies. The base, through its Foreign Technology Division (FTD) and possibly a division dedicated to extraterrestrial technology research (TDETR), has long been a focal point for discussions and theories related to UFOs and alien artifacts, notably including speculations surrounding the Roswell incident.", "media": null, "score": 16, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "comment_count": 0, "over_18": false}, "72": {"id": "1borzsi", "locked": false, "subreddit": "cryptids", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "Nytemare2366", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1711775736.474735, "created_utc": 1711509746.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/v92pl827psqc1.jpeg", "title": "chapstick", "permalink": "/r/cryptids/comments/1borzsi/chapstick/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 123, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "comment_count": 25, "over_18": false}, "73": {"id": "1bpq65g", "locked": false, "subreddit": "thetruthishere", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Spider--G", "link_flair_text": "Theory/Debunking", "time": 1711775736.7154846, "created_utc": 1711613201.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1bpq65g/i_had_a_possession_nightmare/", "title": "I had a possession nightmare.", "permalink": "/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1bpq65g/i_had_a_possession_nightmare/", "selftext": "Possession in a Dream:\nIn this dream, I was at the market near my girlfriend's house. We were walking through the parking lot when I heard something talking to me. This part wasn't clear in my mind after waking up, but I remember fragments. The voice told me that reality was more than this, and that we could perceive it through three means. The only one I remember was sound, and in the dream, it was as if I could see sound waves transferring from one space to another; unfortunately, I don't remember the others.\nAt one point, we went to the room where I was sleeping in real life. It's more common for my girlfriend to come to my house than vice versa, so dreaming that I'm in her room is significant. This part was simple; now the voice was my girlfriend's. She looked at me and said, \"Want to know another way? There's a spirit here in the room.\" At that moment, the spirit entered me, and I laughed in a terrifying way. However, I woke up laughing in the same manner. I experience sleep paralysis very frequently, and whenever I wake up from it, I can't move. But this time, I lifted my head a bit and laughed, almost screaming at the same time. My girlfriend grabbed my head and asked if I was okay, and I continued laughing for about 5 seconds\u2014it was a loud, suffocating, restrained laughter. I'm a very calm person and never have reactions out of the ordinary, especially in dreams. I immediately reassured my girlfriend when I returned to myself, but I was very afraid and sweaty after the nightmare. I've never made noise because of a dream before; this is also the first time.\nI know it's nothing outerwordly but I just wanted some opinions.", "media": null, "score": 13, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "comment_count": 6, "over_18": false}, "74": {"id": "1bnl4yt", "locked": false, "subreddit": "threekings", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "3rroR039", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1711775737.303578, "created_utc": 1711391735.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/threekings/comments/1bnl4yt/three_wish_ritual_questions/", "title": "Three wish ritual questions ", "permalink": "/r/threekings/comments/1bnl4yt/three_wish_ritual_questions/", "selftext": "Yeah hey I'm new to rituals and stuff and I'm on you the three wish ritual but there I got some questions first does it have to be like a livestock field or can it just be like any farm field in general like like cornfield livestock cow field horse field you yet or does it have to be like I want to make sure I'm doing the right field and I will make sure I'm not messing up because the old next to streams and rivers that feed into the Ohio River but you know I just want to make sure I'm not messing up yeah I also saw if this is is scuffed I'm using the mobile also any other tips for the ritual would be very much appreciated because heck I'm also planning to go stargazing tonight so hopefully I can find another field because I found one but it's New Yorker Vos near and has like a river in it but how big does the field need to be and all this other stuff like I got a lot of questions all right please and thank you for reading for this", "media": null, "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comment_count": 0, "over_18": false}, "75": {"id": "1bp9c2w", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ghosts", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "PulsingStars", "link_flair_text": "Personal Encounter ", "time": 1711775737.913755, "created_utc": 1711564672.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/1bp9c2w/we_lived_in_a_haunted_house_quite_a_few_years_ago/", "title": "We lived in a haunted house quite a few years ago in Surrey, just outside London", "permalink": "/r/Ghosts/comments/1bp9c2w/we_lived_in_a_haunted_house_quite_a_few_years_ago/", "selftext": "We had numerous interactions with this being, but the one thing it did to three of us was play with the hair on the backs of our heads while sitting in reclining chairs.
