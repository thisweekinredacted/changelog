She would often see him when she was playing outside. As a child, she found him very scary because he had long, unkempt hair and stared/smiled at her in a very unsettling way. \nWe lived in the same area where my mother grew up, and the possibility that he might become her client (when my mom started the job he would be 60+ years old) worried her. She hadn't shared this concern with anyone. (She later told us that even as an adult she would have nightmares about him because he made her feel so unsafe as a child)\nOn her first day at work with her first client, she was helping her client clean out a cupboard that was completely filled with unopened letters, newspapers, etc. She picked up a random old newspaper, and her eye fell on the obituaries.

But it\u2019s hard to think positively considering what happened to me the last night in Stuttgart, and I\u2019d like a place to talk about it.\nI\u2019d spent about two weeks travelling Germany for the Euros, and considering how many fellow Scotland fans were over for the games I never felt completely alone, despite being a solo traveller in a foreign country. I guess I became too naive in how I trusted the older groups of Scots who\u2019d buy me drinks and chat with me all night about where they\u2019re from, who they knew. Just typical Scottish chats. I let my guard down.\nThat last night in Stuttgart happened like most other nights in Germany. I\u2019d be by myself, and would get noticed by a group of older men or woman who\u2019d enquire as to who I was with. When they heard I was alone, they\u2019d remark at how brave I was as a \u201cgood lookin lassie\u201d being here all by myself. I\u2019d then be integrated in the group; drink with them; celebrate with them; and that night, cry with them after Scotland lost.\nDetermined to enjoy my last night, I said goodbye to my new friends and dawned on a short white dress draped in my scotland flag, and went out looking for a good place to drink and dance with strangers I\u2019d never meet again. I met a few people that night, but it was while I was alone that I met him.\n\u201cThat bags bigger than you are!\u201d I heard as a jolly older man wandered over to me. It was true, I had my rucksack with me that night. \u201cWhere\u2019s your boyfriend to carry it for you?\u201d\n\u201cNot sure yet, still deciding if he\u2019s going to be German or Scottish\u201d I quipped back with a smile. Most of my interactions would start this way, with a friendly interaction resulting in an offer to come drink with their group. And after offering to take me to a nearby Irish pub to drink with him and his family, I graciously accepted and we began walking.\nHe was overly exaggerating how incredible he thought I was for doing this alone, bowing to me and excitedly telling passers by how I was myself and how brave it was. I would smile awkwardly and change the subject. I wish I could say alarm bells were ringing, but they weren\u2019t. After all, he was just a wee Scottish grandpa, one of many I\u2019d met that night. He began prodding me on if I had somewhere to sleep tonight, remarking how they had room in their hotel if need be. \n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t force myself on you or anything\u201d\nI froze. It was so unexpected. I truly looked at him for the first time since I had met him. He was a relatively short man - taller than me - with a larger build and wrinkles to match the white hair that was poking out from under his Scotland cap. He began quickly explaining how he knows I\u2019d be cautious about that sort of thing being a smart girl, that I could trust him\u2026 but again reiterated that he wouldn\u2019t force himself on me. I laughed nervously as all the beer I\u2019d drank earlier seemed to drain from my body, and I began taking in my surroundings. \u201cWhere did you say your family were again?\u201d\n\u201cJust in an Irish pub up this hill! So like I was saying\u2026\u201d\nI didn\u2019t really pay attention to him. We were still on the populated Main Street of Stuttgart, but the numbers were dwindling the further we went. \nMy ears pinged an alert to my brain, signalling i had just missed something important, or horrifying. So I mustered up a smile and politely asked:\n\u201cWhat did you say sorry?\u201d\n\u201cThat I\u2019m vegetarian! Because I killed my 44th man in a vegetable field\u201d\n\u201c\u2026 oh\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been deployed in loads of countries! The first six lives I took were in Ireland\u2026\u201d\nMy blood ran cold. I am a descendant of Irish immigrants who fled to Scotland to escape the brutality of the troubles in Ireland. Did this man kill my family?\n\u201c\u2026 killed 12 in Iraq\u2026\u201d\nI could only listen to parts of his ramblings as I began desperately planning my escape, locking eyes with every person that walked past. There weren\u2019t many, we had almost reached the top of the Main Street now.\n\u201c\u2026why are you so tense all of a sudden?\u201d\nThe words brought me back to the conversation. \u201cYou know I can read you like a book. I\u2019m doing all this for you see\u2026 I want to protect you. And Molly I can guarantee you right now, you don\u2019t realise how much danger you are in\u2026\u201d\nI felt a gentle tap on my shoulder, spinning round to see a young German man smiling at me. \u201cSchottland!\u201d He motioned to my flag \u201cI love Scotland!\u201d\n\u201cIs there anywhere to eat around here\u201d I blurted out, staring at him, praying I\u2019d turn around and the old man would be gone. Brief confusion crossed the Germans face before the old man began rapidly jumbling up the sentence \u201csprechen sie deutsch\u201d in an attempt to sound as if he was speaking German. \u201c\u2026essen\u201d I whispered. The young man pointed in the direction we just walked from.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a McDonalds down there\u201d\nI turned back to the old man, whose look I could only describe as emotionless. As if he was staring through me, like I was no longer there. I felt another cold shiver before smiling \u201cI\u2019m gonna go grab something to eat, but I\u2019ll meet you in the Irish pub later\u201d\nAs if snapping back to his jolly self, the man quipped \u201cnow don\u2019t be like that! I\u2019m off to a rave just now, I\u2019m playing at it! You don\u2019t want to miss it!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll catch it later\u201d I smiled. The mans face again dropped into a blank stare before he turned and walked off. \nI think the German man called after me, but I didn\u2019t hear him. I kept my head down and walked wherever my feet wanted to take me. I couldn\u2019t think, only walk. I don\u2019t know how I got to the train station, nor how I got to the hostel. There were no Irish pubs in Stuttgart, or at least not in that direction. \nTo all solo female travellers, NEVER say you are travelling alone. \nTo the German man, thank you. \nAnd to the Scottish man, let\u2019s not meet again.", "media": null, "score": 192, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "comment_count": 15, "over_18": true}, "13": {"id": "1dp02iw", "locked": false, "subreddit": "threekings", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Current_Watercress86", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1719628996.2596188, "created_utc": 1719412397.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/threekings/comments/1dp02iw/ritual_to_speak_to_a_specific_dead_person/", "title": "ritual to speak to a specific dead person?", "permalink": "/r/threekings/comments/1dp02iw/ritual_to_speak_to_a_specific_dead_person/", "selftext": "So one of my best friends passed away unexpectedly because of an drug overdose (at least that's what I think happened).\nI haven't been in contact with him since the 4th of June and he died on the 22nd of June.\nHe had a history of drug use for many years which is also why we haven't been talking much lately since I was trying to get clean.\nI have a few questions about his death and I also want to tell him a few things I should've said before he died.\nI want to apologise for a lot of things and just let him know that I really valued him as a friend and will keep his memory alive.\nI could of course just do that or like write him a letter and place it at his grave or something (his funeral will be next week).\nBut I really want to talk to him.\nSadly I don't really have any belongings of his expect for a spoon he used in my room to cook crack with or an old chapstick I bought him.\nI only have two pictures of us together that I could print out but that's it.\nI was thinking about using my spirit box to try and communicate with him.\nBut are there any other options?

Ten years ago, my life was upended by a mysterious condition that left me in chronic pain. I'll save the details of how it started for another time, but this condition set me on a relentless quest for answers. I went through blood tests, MRIs, muscle biopsies, CAT scans, X-rays, and consulted heart and nerve specialists. Every test came back normal. \nHow could everything appear normal when I was in such agony? A diagnosis would have given me a direction, a plan, but I was left with nothing but worsening pain. It was like a slow, inescapable curse, growing more intense each day. As the physical pain increased, so did the torment in my mind. My thoughts became a horror story of their own, filled with visions of doom and an overwhelming sense of despair. I berated myself, convinced I was a failure. I was broken\u2014mentally, physically, emotionally, and spiritually. Suicidal thoughts haunted me. \nI know it sounds strange, but the pain took on a demonic quality. I had visions of hellish landscapes and heard whispers telling me I would never get better, that ending my life was the only escape. This nightmarish existence continued for years until I met a teacher who changed everything. He wasn\u2019t just a massage therapist; he specialized in the mind-body connection, blending techniques from massage, energy work, and emotional release. That meeting marked the beginning of a new chapter in my life.\nOne day, my healer was over, working on my right shoulder while we chatted. Suddenly, my right calf started tightening up, something I had never felt before. It was pulsating and moving in a wave-like motion. I told my healer, who instructed me to lie face down on my bed quickly.\nI followed his directions and lay down. As soon as he started working on my calf, I felt an overwhelming urge to break into an absurd, evil laughter. It was as if I was an observer in the background of my own mind while something else took control. The more he worked on my calf, the harder it became to contain the laughter. Eventually, I burst into what can only be described as an insane, maniacal, almost cartoonish laughter. It wasn\u2019t even a masculine laugh; it was a high-pitched, feminine cackle, twisted with an evil edge. Afterward, I tried to replicate it, but it was impossible. \nDuring this bizarre episode, I had a vision of a broken girl\u2014abandoned, devoid of love, clad in tattered white clothing with hair obscuring her face. She was filled with chaos, hatred, and sorrow. As my healer continued, the laughter softened. I felt the entity\u2019s pain, its sense of abandonment and loveless existence. The laughter turned to weeping, and eventually, it faded away, as if the energy was being released. I found myself telling the entity to follow the path of light for its soul\u2019s ascension, assuring it that there was more beyond despair.\nAfter this intense session, my calf was sore for a week. My healer later explained that our auras are like those block shape games\u2014when our thoughts are destructive and negative, our aura shape changes to fit lower energies, much like a triangle becoming a square. But if we maintain a high frequency, filled with positive thoughts and actions, those lower energies can't attach to us. \nNow, I\u2019m doing much better, constantly working on positive thinking and making my mind an ally rather than an adversary. These lower energies, lacking physical bodies, can\u2019t nourish themselves through normal means. Instead, they feed on negative energy\u2014what some call \"loosh.\" Thoughts of chaos, hatred, and envy are a feast for them. The greatest surges of loosh energy occur on battlefields, but that\u2019s a story for another day.\nI'm doing a lot better now and always working to going in the right direction, my focus tends to  be on solutions rather than problems these days. I wanted to write this story just to be wary of your thoughts, depression, and how you are feeling, because if you are always In the mindset of despair and chaos,you never know what energies may find that worth something to attach onto and feed and grow it. \nThank you for reading.

I wanted to share my story that has occurred over the past 5 years. This story is about me (currently 20) and my stalker ex (currently 23).\nThe start of our relationship: 2019-2021\n 5 years ago I met my ex, I\u2019ll call him Alex for my own safety. In early to mid 2019 I came across Alex\u2019s profile on Instagram and recognized him as a student who attended the same high school as me. I always thought he was attractive so I followed him on instagram and to my surprise he actually responded to one of my stories. We started messaging on instagram back and forth then the both of us quickly found out that we liked each other. We started calling each other and sleeping on the phone. One night while I had fell asleep on the phone with Alex I heard his voice coming from the phone whispering something like \u201cI would r word you\u201d and things along that manner. I thought I was hearing things so brushed it off and thought I was just dreaming. Eventually me and him started dating and going on dates. Everything was pretty well except for the fact that when he would kiss me he would bite me extremely hard, to the point it would make me bleed. I told him multiple times not to do it but he would always continue. A couple months into dating a girl had made a video on instagram claiming he was a cheater but he denied to me that he even knew this girl and I believed him. 10 months of dating went by and a friend sent me of screenshot of him being active on tinder. I immediately broke up with him after that. A couple months later I started dating someone new. During this relationship with my new partner, Alex would blow up my phone with messages and calls. I decided to block him. He then started driving past my house every single day. At this point I had started my first job and he would eventually show up there too. I even moved jobs and he found me there as well. \nGetting back together (2021-2023)\nThe situation eventually died down. Randomly out of blue I get a flower delivery of pink roses, it had Alex\u2019s name on the card attached but nothing written. Being the stupid 17/18 year old senior in high I was I actually unblocked him and thanked him. He asked to hangout and I willingly went to hangout with him soon after we started texting. My 17 year old self thought it was cool to be dating a hot well known older boy so i eventually fell back into Alex. After a couple times of hanging out we started dating again. I eventually lost my v card to Alex and we started regularly sleeping with each other. One day he texted me saying he had a surprise for me then sent me a iCloud file. I opened the file and it was a video of us having sex. I had no idea he recorded us having sex , I couldn\u2019t even consent I was 17 at the time and he was 20. Again stupid 17 year old me stayed with him regardless of the red flags. Eventually our relationship became sexually and physically abusive. One night he raped me intoxicated /unconscious and left bruising on my head and abdomen. A couple days after that I decided enough was enough and broke up with him .\nThe stalking (2023-2024)\nImmediately following the breakup he would constantly text and call me. He would beg for me to see him. I kept denying but he kept going. He would threaten to come into my house in the middle of the night while I was asleep. This happened for a couple months. During this time I met someone new and we started dating. I was having trouble with my mom and my new partner asked me to move in with him. Somehow Alex found out where me and my new partner were living so he started showing up at our place. We documented everything from our cameras and ended up filing a restraining order against Alex. We got granted a temp order until our hearing. Our hearing day came and the judge extended the temporary order to let things \u201ccool down for 6 months\u201d and if he breaks the order the judge will grant a long term order at the next hearing. Within days of extending the temp order Alex violated it by parking in front of my house on multiple occasions. I called the cops multiple times but never even gave him a warning. One day while I was working I get a call from my local PD that Alex tried purchasing a firearm (which violates our order) they just warned him not to do it again and had to let me know for my safety. Obviously knowing your crazy ex has tried purchasing a firearm is scary itself. The following days he would follow me to work and stand in front of my bfs truck in the early hours of the morning. \nMost current/fleeing(2024)\nHe would start tailgating me on my way to work or swerve in front of me in his car. Me and my bf moved somewhere else but in the same city still. Somehow Alex still managed to find us. My bf decided that if the cops weren\u2019t going to help us then we would need to leave the state. We ended up packing up everything in the middle of the night and driving a state over where my bfs family lives. I have been here for about two months. Me and bf found good jobs and plan on leasing our own apartment soon. It\u2019s been peaceful for the most part however I still hear about what Alex does back home. He still tells everyone that we are together still and even posts pictures of me on instagram. My story is still ongoing and I left out a lot of details.\nIf you have any questions don\u2019t hesitate to reach out. :)", "media": null, "score": 77, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comment_count": 10, "over_18": true}, "28": {"id": "1dpqvty", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ghosts", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "bocakai", "link_flair_text": "Is this paranormal?", "time": 1719629005.86062, "created_utc": 1719493732.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/cx6fr1mo549d1.jpeg", "title": "am i being haunted or is someone coming into my apartment illegally?", "permalink": "/r/Ghosts/comments/1dpqvty/am_i_being_haunted_or_is_someone_coming_into_my/", "selftext": "i moved to a new building last month and never felt any negative energy in it until this week. a few doors were open when they were surely left closed, but i didn\u2019t think much of it until my roommate came home to every cabinet open in the kitchen. no signs of forced entry, nothing missing, just wide open cabinets. \nhere\u2019s the catch: this place uses those tap keys instead of traditional ones. i\u2019ve heard there can be issues with the system and theorized that someone else\u2019s keys could be unlocking it, our unit is also next to the matience closet so it could be someone miss using their skeleton key? we have our work schedules written out on a whiteboard so maybe some freak is coming in because he knows when we\u2019re out.\nwe took the schedule down and installed cameras last night, so i guess we\u2019ll see. assuming we don\u2019t catch anyone, how do i get rid of this spirit?? what type of ghost does this??

There was no possibility of any of the other pilots having missed such a prominent formation in process of being made.\nThus the natural Shree Yantra formation has been seen in Oregon, United States of America. During August of 1990, a pilot in the Idaho Air National Guard noticed a huge etching while flying over on a dried-up lake-bed in Oregon. The massive Shree Yantra found in that dry lake bed of Oregon was 23 kilometres long and was etched 10 inches (or 25.4 centimetres) wide and 3 inches (or 7.5 centimetres) deep into the surface. There were no tire marks or any sign which could suggest that any human had made it. According to the pilots (who regularly trained the area) \u2013 neither the design was ever seen earlier in that area prior to this nor they observed any design-in-process or any unusual activity in that area. There was no possibility of any of the other pilots having missed such a prominent formation in process of its creation. Later, the design was identified as the ancient Indian meditation tool called \u2013 the Shree Yantra.\nAccording to the officials this Shree Yantra had appeared supernaturally. This was way back in the 1990s when technology was not so advanced that such a huge Shree Yantra can be etched without leaving any signs of construction. But it can be said that it could be one of the reasons behind America\u2019s wealth and progress\nLieutenant Bill Miller of the 190th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron, immediately reported the details of what he had spotted to the authorities at the Air National Guard \u2013 a 13.3 mile glyph of lines about a quarter of a mile in width and length, on the extremely hard, sun-baked dry bed of a lake in Mickey Basin located southeast of Steens Mountains in the Alvord Desert, 70 miles away from the city of Burns in Oregon.\nThe formation detected on the morning of August 10, 1990 was oriented precisely in the North-South direction. The glyph had a machine like precision in its shape and clarity of lines.\nAfter Bill Miller reported the observation, the news was concealed from the public by the authorities for thirty days.\nThe news hit the media in the United States on 12th September, 1990 when Boise TV station first aired the story. As soon as the story was aired, the glyph was quickly identified as the ancient Hindu meditation device- the Sri Yantra- identical in shape and proportion, and in its geometrical properties. No one had a theory why a pictograph of a complex Hindu meditation yantra should appear in the wilderness of Oregon. The story caught the attention of the media and the viewers alike.\nBy September 14th, the story was picked up by the Associated Press, Bend Bulletin and the Oregonian. The Oregonian reported that some architects that had been contacted by the newspaper, had said that the cost of conducting a land survey alone, before such a project could be initiated, would range from 75,000 to 100,000 dollars. The Sri Yantra design has a degree of complexity and a level of symmetry that makes it difficult to recreate its design even on paper, let alone furrow an enormous replication of it on a dry lake-bed. There was therefore a good deal of speculation that the glyph was not man-made.\nThere were other reasons too to support this theory \u2013 not the least important of them being the fact that, the shape produced by the lines in this massive Sri Yantra at Oregon, could not be deciphered while standing on the ground. In fact, the shape only made sense when viewed from a height of a few thousand feet above.\nIn Vedic texts, the Sri Yantra is defined as a device formed by nine interlocking triangles. Four triangles point upward (representing Shiva) overlapping with five downward-pointing triangles (representing Shakti). The triangles are placed in a circle surrounded by the two levels of lotus-petals, which in turn are surrounded by an outer circle and enclosed in a tantra design, serving as a protective cover. As the devotee enters into the Mandala, represented by the Sri Yantra, he leaves behind the worldly distractions and conflicts; and is transported into a world of symbols and visualizations.\nThe triangles surround and radiate out from a bindu point. The bindu represents the junction point between the physical universe and its un-manifest source. The nine triangles are interlaced in such a way so as to create forty three smaller triangles symbolic of the entire cosmos.\nThe Sri Yantra is variedly described as a visual representation of the sound \u2018Om\u2019 and an expression of the philosophy of \u2018Advaita (one-ness or non-duality)\u2018. The Sri Yantra is popularly used today in India as a meditation device.\nTwo UFO Researchers, Don Newman and Alan Decker, visited the site on the morning of 15th September and reported that no trace of tire track markings or foot prints were visible anywhere close to the site even though their own station wagon had now left quarter inch deep marks into the hard crust of the surface along the track from where they had approached the formation.\nDr. James Deardorff, a Research Professor Emeritus at the Atmospheric Science Department of Oregon State University and a colleague of Don Newman and Alan Decker, compiled the details of their investigations and forwarded the story to UFO magazine, a British magazine devoted to the subject of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and extraterrestrial life. The magazine had an international reputation for quality and authenticity and agreed to publish the story which appeared in Volume 6, # 3 in 1991 under the heading, \u2018A Symbol on the Oregon Desert\u2019.\nDr. Deardorff wrote in his investigative story that the government had not been able to give a reasonable explanation to the public as to how a glyph of such a large size had made an undetected appearance on a desolate site, which was constantly patrolled by the Idaho National Air Guard. About forty days after the appearance of the glyph, a group of four people, headed by a Bill Witherspoon, claimed that they had etched out the pictograph, over a period of 10 days, by pulling a garden cultivator like a plow over the lakebed. Mr. Witherspoon said that he had used ropes to ensure that the lines were straight and the angles perfect. Dr. Deardorff countered by saying that the story was concocted, and that it was sponsored by the government in its effort to quell the public furor. In all fairness to the government authorities though, it might be added here, that the government was probably acting in what it considers is in the best interest of the general public. The authorities did not want to fuel the belief that the glyph had an unexplained origin.\nBill Witherspoon was interviewed by newspapers to judge the authenticity of his story. Very quickly it became evident that his explanations lacked credibility. The most unconvincing part of his story was his claim that a garden plow, a rope and a blueprint of the formation were enough equipment to furrow out the glyph effortlessly. Bill Witherspoon\u2019s electronic interview revealed other incongruities. For one, he had stated in the newspapers that he and his team had carried their tools for three quarters of a mile to the formation site everyday for 10 days, however in his video interview he said that he and his team had camped out two miles away from the site.\nBill Witherspoon\u2019s team only managed to gouge out a \u00bd inch deep line with great exertion when they were asked to demonstrate how they had gouged out 13.3 miles of lines, 3 inches deep and 10 inches wide. The line lacked neatness, and, the displaced soil fell unevenly on the two sides of the carved line. No one believed anymore that the original glyph could have been created by using crude tools such as garden plows.", "media": null, "score": 1852, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "comment_count": 374, "over_18": false}, "33": {"id": "1dm1ygz", "locked": false, "subreddit": "uap", "stickied": false, "category": "Aliens", "author": "ufoarchivist", "link_flair_text": "Video", "time": 1719629010.1873758, "created_utc": 1719080410.0, "url": "https://youtu.be/oj-D9vYMzX4", "title": "Do military sensors see UAP Blue Shift Warp Signature - Prof Simon", "permalink": "/r/UAP/comments/1dm1ygz/do_military_sensors_see_uap_blue_shift_warp/", "selftext": "", "media": {"type": "youtube.com", "oembed": {"provider_url": "https://www.youtube.com/", "version": "1.0", "title": "Are military sensors capable of detecting UAP Blue Shift Warp Signature? - Prof. Simon Holland", "type": "video", "thumbnail_width": 480, "height": 200, "width": 356, "html": "<iframe width=\"356\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oj-D9vYMzX4?feature=oembed&enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen title=\"Are military sensors capable of detecting UAP Blue Shift Warp Signature? - Prof. Simon Holland\"></iframe>", "author_name": "UFO Archives", "provider_name": "YouTube", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oj-D9vYMzX4/hqdefault.jpg", "thumbnail_height": 360, "author_url": "https://www.youtube.com/@UFOArchivist"}}, "score": 43, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "comment_count": 2, "over_18": false}, "34": {"id": "1dloac9", "locked": false, "subreddit": "conspiracy", "stickied": false, "category": "Consipiracy", "author": "Particular_Meet_6429", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1719629011.2430754, "created_utc": 1719033730.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/nlzployu528d1.jpeg", "title": "So everyone just moved on from this?", "permalink": "/r/conspiracy/comments/1dloac9/so_everyone_just_moved_on_from_this/", "selftext": "Its been five months and theres zero footage of what actually happened at the mall in Miami, despite the police saying that it was just a bunch of teenagers fucking around.

I don't know much about Jane except that she's from a small town and she moved here with her friends and boyfriend for university. When I first met Jane at the pub, I thought she hated my guts, she always gave me nasty looks, and when my friends tried to approach her friends, she'd be rude to me. Jane is pretty, like very very pretty. Like every guy in town has a thing for her. But Jane's boyfriend is insane, to say the least. They are regulars at the pub, and I've seen them break up around 3-4 times, and the waiter working at the pub (guy in my friendgroup) says he's noticed them break up a dozen more, but they always come back together. \nCouple of months back, I had just finished with the gym and I had just showered when my mom called and asked about this pub, and how's the food there. I told her the food's to die for, and she said she and my stepdad were on their way there. I told them I would meet them too because I was dying for some hot wings and a burger. We sit down, and me and my dad just start drinking beer after beer. And in no time I had downed five 0.5l pints of beer. I was getting a little bit tipsy but I kept pushing though. My dear friend (Let's call her Tina) called and asked if I was down for a drink. I told her to come to the pub as I was already there, she's gonna meet my folk, and they planned on leaving soon, so she and I could continue. That's how it happened. My parents left and Tina and I continued drinking on our own.\nThe pub was closing, so Tina decided to go to the bathroom, and I walked with her inside to see if I could get another pint. We stumble upon Jane. Jane starts talking to Tina, and I realize they know each other. We all sit down to comfort her as she was a crying mess. Her bf and she were done for good, and she revealed that he used to really abuse her. Mentally and physically. I felt bad for her, so when she rested on my shoulder I just let her.\nTomorrow night, I get a DM from her, and she's apologizing about the trauma dumping. I tell her it's no biggie as we all need to vent sometimes (albeit I do that to my therapist not strangers but whatever, The therapist is a stranger I pay ig.) We continue chatting, and she constantly goes between I can't text you, and then texting me again. Don't text me, and text me first when I don't (keep in mind this is like 2 days since that interaction).\nOne drunken night, she texted me to meet her, it was around 2 am, and I had my lil cousin over, that whole night we watched movies and he had just fallen asleep. So I declined her offer (also I feel it be a bit weird for me to hang out with her completely sober while she can barely see, idk just weird to me). The next day, she's sobered up, and I agree to meet her for a hangout. We hung out for a while, and she was fun to hang out with, I did like her, and worry about her and her ex. Soon enough, her leech of an ex left town as he was never really interested in uni, just being close to her.\nOn one of our dates, she revealed to me that she realized she had feelings for me, and that's when she broke up with her ex, resulting in him physically attacking her.\nOne day, we had a date at her place. A little study date. After we finished studying, we relaxed on the couch and ended up making out. We didn't have sex that night but I fingered her. I went home and we continued talking about it, even exchanging photos (my first and only time sending a nude), and then we hooked up.\nNow, I'm a person who likes alone time, so sometimes I just wanna chill at my house and not really be with anyone, and she did not like this idea. She started spamming me with calls, saying how she could come over and we will chill, she will be silent and I'd still be alone. In my opinion, this kinda defeats the idea of being alone, as IM NOT FUCKING ALONE? She threatened me that if I didn't pick up the phone she would never talk to me again. This is where I snapped, and told her that her lukewarm at best manipulation tactics would not work on me and to not contact me again. She flipped out and came to my part of town. Hanging out and waiting for me to come out. I told her, I begged her millions of times not to come to my house, but she simply said \"Nah, I'll pass\" and came anyway. I literally felt so disrespected because all of a sudden I hold no value in life. When she texted me \"Come out I'm here\" I texted her \"Nah, I'll pass\" and stayed home.\nNow, she's following me everywhere I go (it's been months, and I'm dating the girl of my dreams) but that has not stopped her from being in my shadow. She learned my routine. When do I go to the gym, when I'm at practice ect. and she never fails to show up or drive past where I'm at. My stepbrother reviewed the security footage from our house, and we counted her car driving past my house at least 14 times in a day.\nI still get texts from her on the daily even though she's blocked. She gets wasted and spams me with messages on WhatsApp that she then deletes. My girlfriend is absolutely livid with this chick as she would not leave me the fuck alone.\nI do not fear for my life, but I have warned my friends that if I die, it would not be an accident or a suicide, she's in my shadow, I constantly have to check my 6 to see if she's behind me.", "media": null, "score": 42, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comment_count": 7, "over_18": true}, "42": {"id": "1dpe87q", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ghosts", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Alarming-List1988", "link_flair_text": "Cemeteries ", "time": 1719629014.392491, "created_utc": 1719448526.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1dpe87q", "title": "Me and my friends heard that Aux Sable Cemetery is haunted so we went during a storm and we took this picture right as lightning struck.

I used to chat to Amanda everyday for the next two weeks simply because she used to message me constantly, she seemed like a nice girl at first until she started to make me feel uncomfortable around her as she used to message me \"I want to cuddle you like a big teddy bear\" and similar things to that and I shot it down and she got upset and threatened to call the police on me if I didn't go on a date with her (I'm a gay guy BTW but I wasn't out of the closet at this point of my life) I screenshoted everything she said to me and I showed my friend Candle and she stated \"Yeah, I believe you. She a conpulsive liar, she lied about a teacher SAing her and used to make things up to make her sound better than everyone else\" I was so glad Candle believed me and advised me to block Amanda which I did. \nFast forward two years later; I was now in college and I encountered her again, I didn't recognise her and was chatting to her without realising she was the same Amanda from two years prior. That was until I messaged Candle on Facebook as Amanda told me she knew Candle. Candle sent me a long paragraph \"Erm, you do realise that's Amanda right?\" Then it all came flooding back to me... She's right it's the same girl who threatened to call the police on me for not going on a date with her... she was dating a friend (now bestest friend) of mine in college I tried to warn him but he didn't listen to me. Amanda claimed to have a crush on me a second time I shot it down right away and told her I'm not interested, she obviously took offense to that and threatened to call the police again, to which I replied \"What's police going to do? This isn't a police matter\" which by looked at her facial expression, angered her more but she walked off. \nThe next couple of weeks go by, I ended up telling my friend about what she's been messaging me with and he obviously believed me as he saw her messaging me in real time. She kept asking me on a date and saying she liked me since day one etc. But here's the thing... she was IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH MY FRIEND!! Naturally my friend got upset and called her in front of me and she claimed she had no clue what he's talking about, and told him I'm making up lies. Then he forgave her as she admitted it was true just a week later... too my annoyance she began hanging out with us, I was nice to her because I didn't want my friend to get upset she tried telling me she had two children at 17 with one being 13 and one being 3 years old, I thought that's odd, how is she 17 and having a 13 year old child? She would have been 4, something wasn't adding up. She stated she was SA'd when she was young. I should have called her out but my friend was there and I didn't want to upset him. She even stated the 3 year old child was my friends daughter, even he looked confused like it was the first time he ever heard of this child. When she went home I asked him, he stated \"No idea she never mentioned a child before now and we definitely never had s*x\" very strange. \nFast forward a year I was working in a shop, she suddenly showed up and asked to speak to me, my manager let me go on my 30 minute lunch. She was with her friend and she wanted to tell me that my best-friend (lets officially give him the name Marcus) was manipulating her and always hurting her which I knew for a fact wasn't true, Marcus wouldn't hurt a fly but I listened to whatever else she wanted to say. She said she was trapped in a relationship with him and felt scared of him, no idea why she was telling me this knowing I don't like her. I just made out I believed her and headed back to work. I came home and Facetime Marcus and told him everything she told me earlier that day, he started crying his eyes out because he found out she cheated on him with another guy, a friend of his showed him a picture as proof and forwarded it to me, it was definitely a picture of her with some guy kissing on a bus. I told Marcus he needs to get away from her ASAP. Which he did... until the next day they were back together as he YET AGAIN forgave her.\nWe started doing group video chats, me Marcus and Amanda (at her request) and remember her three year old from the year prior? Well now she's a 5 year old called Lily (who literally never existed) and I asked her about the 13 year old she mentioned and she replied with \"I don't have a child other than Lily\". And the next couple of months go by and she used to say \"Lily's in bed\" or \"Lily's at school\" etc, when I call her out she used to 'show' us Lily by turning the camera to a pitch black area of her bedroom and quickly put the camera back to her. I thought this was odd and said \"why did you move the camera so fast? We didn't see anything\" she then replied \"Because she's camera shy\" or \"She's asleep\" I couldn't take it anymore it was excuse after excuse if Lily was Marcus's daughter he deserves to see her as he literally never met or see this 'Lily' not even once, I sent her a long message stating that Lily does not exist, and why no pictures of her. Then I blocked her because I had enough of her playing games with my best friend. She then went on people's Facebook and I kidd you not, she took photos of random people's children and claimed them as 'Lily' me and Marcus looked at each other and knew these were different pictures of random kids. Some of them wasn't even girls. \nThis went on until one day me and Marcus went to Amanda's mothers workplace and Marcus showed her all the messages especially the ones about this 'Lily' and the many pictures of her and random guys she meets up with (some of the men Amanda met up with were like 50-60 years old) and we found her on a dating website asking for men to \"fattern her up\". We showed everything to Amanda's mother. Her mother was furious. She said Amanda NEVER HAD KIDS, she was never SA'd as a child, and knew something was odd as she got into some random man's car just the day before. I thought this was the end of Amanda but I couldn't be more wrong as Marcus like an idiot met up with her that evening and FORGAVE HER FOR THE MILLIONTH TIME. \nAnd then something strange happened the next day... Marcus called me on Facetime and he was furious (AT ME!) I asked him what's going on and what did I do!? He told me I was a bad friend and he wants to cut me out of his life... I was in shock... and I heard Amanda laughing in the background then it clicked. She said something about me which wasn't true and now me and Marcus are arguing like crazy and he blocked me on everything which broke my heart as this boy was my best friend and now he's believing his conpulsive lying girlfriend over me. Me and Marcus were having on and off arguments all the time, and Amanda was at the root of it telling him lies and manipulating him like she was jealous of our friendship... maybe she thought I was a threat to her relationship with Marcus and tried to split us up as best friends. She literally used to invite me out with them and when I turn up she used to be like \"I wanted to spend time with you, why is HE HERE?\" Excuse me? You're the one who invited me!! This happened every single time until one time I snapped back at her which made her cry but I didn't care she needed to stop doing this to me as it wasn't healthy for my mental health.\nA few weeks go by, Marcus was texting me on Facebook Messenger and we were having a laugh like we used to. He went to the toilet as he was with Amanda, then I suddenly got a text from Marcus again saying \"Hi it's Amanda\" I replied with \"Hey\" and she started sending me threatening messages saying I need to leave Marcus alone and he doesn't like me and I need to move on. I was like WHAT THE F*CK? I ended up arguing with her over this saying why the hell is she using his phone sending me these messages? Amanda was like \"I dare you come say it to my face!\" At this point I had enough and contacted a friend of mine lets call her Jasmine and told her the situation I ended up in tears on the phone, I've known Jasmine since Primary School and we been close friends since so she naturally got defensive and asked me to get in her car and she'll drop me off where they are so I can 'say it to her face' Jasmine wanted to hurt Amanda for what's she's done to me. We saw them and we confronted them, Marcus genuinely had no clue what was going on until I showed him the messages Amanda sent on his phone. He was furious and walked off in tears I ran after him leaving Amanda and Jasmine alone.\nMe and Marcus hugged it out and we had a talk about what's happened, he was telling me that he isn't allowed friends anymore and Amanda even made him choose between her and his family which made me furious even more. I had enough of the way she's treating my best friend. \nThe next day Jasmine messaged me and said she can't be friends anymore as I was 'bullying' Amanda for months which wasn't true I would never bully anyone. I said to Jasmine if she was my real friend she would know Amanda was lying but obviously not. To this very day I never saw Jasmine again, this felt like a big betrayal of our friendship and I would never talk to Jasmine ever again. This was over six years ago now.\nMe and Marcus was getting on better and he wasn't letting Amanda manipulate him anymore. That was until these boys come into our lives, we'll first was another girl I was friends with called Alice. I known Alice for years and I invited her out with me and Marcus to a Pub for a few drinks, it was a nice evening and Alice even called Amanda and told her she needs to leave Marcus alone (we were drunk) and that evening when we were saying goodbye as I was naturally worried for Marcus as he's like a little brother to me at this point, Alice asked if I was gay (which I am gay but I wasn't out of the closet yet so I responded with no) and Alice said \"Then why you worried about Marcus you obviously fancy him\" well, no he's like a brother to me and we been through a lot because of Amanda so I obviously do care about him. \nI thought to forget about this conversation as I assumed she was just making conversation. Alice messaged Marcus asking him out on a date on a messaging app and by end of that week they started dating. I was happy he's moving on from Amanda... boy was I wrong. I started receiving messages from Alice's brother and his friend stating to slice my throat and messaging Marcus to help them beat me up. We was talked into joining group video call and the call contained me, Marcus, Amanda and Alice's brother and his friend. Saying horrible things towards me saying I should die and I hurt women which wasn't true it was more of Amanda's lies and I was messaging Marcus to back me up because he was quiet while I'm trying to defend myself against these guys. He just read my messages and still sat there not saying anything. At this point I had enough and just left the call and left the group and blocked the lot of them apart of Marcus. \nMarcus called me the next morning saying sorry for not defending me I replied with \"well that isn't good enough, they were literally threatening me.\" Marcus went quiet and said sorry again by that point I ended the call because I couldn't be bothered with this stress anymore. Next thing I know Alice was denying that she ever dated Marcus and claiming I made a fake account of her on the messaging app... ARE YOU SERIOUS MATE?! I also noticed Alice was being besties with Amanda on Facebook so that's the puzzle fitting. \nAt this point I wanted to end my life I was at my lowest. I was losing all my friends because of this Amanda. This was the start of my depression getting worse and worse. Me and Marcus eventually made up and we are best friends again but there was a time period where we didn't talk for over a year I guess that's me trying to move on with my life. But we eventually started talking again and me and Marcus met up again just the two of us and he was saying how sorry he was for everything he's done. I said it's okay, he was under Amanda's control. \nFast forward to 2024, Marcus has a new Fianc\u00e9e who is a lovely girl and I'm going to be best man at his wedding because (this part I did miss out in the story) I stopped him from jumping every time Amanda cheated on him. I was always there for him. He now sees I was always there for him and we are closer than ever. He even defends me a lot more nowadays and always has my back. \nI've seen Amanda here and there a few times but I don't even acknowledge her, or them as Amanda is now 'non-binary' which I don't believe as it could be another lie for attention. But I'm not judging, if that's how they feel then that's up to them but that doesn't change the person who nearly destroyed my life. \nLast time I saw Amanda was last year at Pride, they were pointing at me showing their current boyfriend who I am. I didn't notice until my other best friend (not Marcus) pointed it out to me. That was the last time I ever saw them and hopefully never again.\nThere's a lot I missed out on this story as it happened over a couple of years. But I just want to say, Amanda, let's not meet... EVER AGAIN.", "media": null, "score": 41, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "comment_count": 18, "over_18": true}, "55": {"id": "1dpqxzf", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ghosts", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Narrow_Ad6513", "link_flair_text": "Captured Apparition ", "time": 1719629023.505088, "created_utc": 1719493905.0, "url": "https://v.redd.it/v4oox427649d1", "title": "can somebody explain??

administration regarding over-classification and classification reforms\nA bipartisan group of ten U.S. senators, including Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner (D-VA), sent Federal Chief Information Officer Clare Martorana a letter requesting an update on the implementation of classification reforms enacted in December 2023.\n\n\"The government systematically overclassifies too much information at great cost to both public trust and national security,\" the group wrote. \"At the same time, the government often fails to protect the nation's most important secrets.\"\n\nJune 21 \u2013 Fox News covers alleged threats to UAP whistleblowers\nIn a recent article, Fox News covered the alleged threats UAP whistleblowers have received.\n\n\"Lou [Elizondo] is a dear friend of mine, and I take any threat against anybody seriously, especially against friends and somebody that has given so much to this country and to this issue [UAPs]. So, I'm very much aware of it, and I'm very much alarmed. I'm pursuing every avenue I can to get to the bottom of it.\" \u2013 Rep. Burchett speaking with Fox.\n\nJune 21 \u2013 Sen. Gillibrand doubles down on her desire to have any secret SAPs shared with Congress\nIn a conversation with Askapol, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (KG) seemed unaware of any current efforts to revive the UAPDA in the Senate (although she also seemed not to remember having been one of its original sponsors back in 2023...), but reiterated her efforts related to having all SAPs disclosed to Congress.\n\nKG:\u00a0\u201cI have no basis to know one way or the other. I just know the provisions that I've tried to include would try to guarantee that we know about all SAPs. For example, I don't know if there are presidential SAPs.\u201d\u00a0\nML:\u00a0\u201cInteresting.\u201d\u00a0\nKG:\u00a0\u201cMeaning, I don't know if there's legal structure, under our framework, for presidents to put Special Access Programs for president eyes only. And if that exists, then I don't know about it. But I don't think that should exist based on balance of powers and based on the fact that Congress is responsible for allocating money.\u201d\u00a0\nML:\u00a0\u201cDo you think your amendment would weed that out?\u201d\u00a0\nKG:\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s what I'm trying to do.\u201d\u00a0\nML:\u00a0\u201cYeah? Interesting, because over in the House, the UAP Caucus,\u00a0they were just pressing the Secretary of Energy\u00a0on kind of their role with this.\u201d\u00a0\nKG:\u00a0\u201cI don't know if there's Department of Energy SAPs that we don't know about. But again, I don't have oversight of the Department of Energy. I have oversight over the Department of Defense and Intel. So I can follow up on that and ask my colleagues who are on the right committee, Energy and Commerce, if they've ever looked into it.\u201d\u00a0\nML:\u00a0\u201cBecause that's so interesting for me to hear Senators be like, \u2018Yeah, I don't know.\u2019\u201d\u00a0\nKG:\u00a0\u201cWell we aren\u2019t read in. If there are any programs, we are not read in. That's all I can say.\u201d\n\nJune 22 \u2013 Senator Rounds provides an update on the UAPDA\nSpeaking with Askapol, Sen. Rounds (one of the architects of the original UAP Disclosure Act of 2023 language) confirmed that efforts are still underway to move forward with the originally proposed language.\n\nAskapol:\u00a0\u201cAny update on the tweaks in your UAPDA amendment with [Sen. Chuck] Schumer?\u201d\nRounds:\u00a0\u201cNo, not a whole lot of anything there, just simply continuing to move forward and we\u2019ll see where it goes.\u201d\nAskapol:\u00a0\u201cBecause that wasn\u2019t really debated at all. That issue, in the House NDAA this year. Do you think there\u2019s an appetite for it over here?\u201d\u00a0\nRounds:\u00a0\u201cI think we just got to clarify what our goals on it are, and I think we can work through them. You know, bottom line is nobody is trying to release information on classified programs that would help our adversaries [...] But, I think more openness in terms of what we can talk about can help clarify that maybe there is nothing to be afraid of out there.\u201d\n\nThings to look out for in the near future:\nJuly/August\n\nAccording to Senator Gillibrand \u2013 a public hearing in line with AARO's latest report can be expected soon, saying \u2013\"I\u2019m hoping July, and if not then September. But I\u2019m trying to do July.\u201d\nSpeaking with Askapol, Reps. Luna and Burchett indicated that the next UAP hearing is likely to come after the August recess.\nLue Elizondo has indicated his much-awaited book will be published in August 2024. Elizondo was the former director of the now defunct Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP) \u2013 a program associated with the release of the Pentagon UFO videos.\n\nBeyond/currently unknown\n\nFollowing\u00a0the UAP hearing on the 26th of July, Members of Congress have\u00a0called for a select committee with subpoena authority, to \u201cgo about the task of collecting information from the Pentagon and elsewhere\u201d on unidentified flying objects. There have been conflicting messages from various Members of Congress on whether this is likely to happen anytime soon. Note \u2013 a select subcommittee was formally requested on March 13th.\nReps. Moskowitz, Luna, and Burchett have repeatedly stated their intent to hold field hearings to overcome stonewalling from the Pentagon and military establishment \"I think we [Congress] should try to get into one of these places [housing UAP evidence]...and if they won't let us in I think we should have a field hearing right outside the building...and the military will have to explain why that is.\" \u2013\u00a0Rep. Moskowitz (D)\u00a0It is currently unknown when exactly we might expect that to occur, however as of Jan 12 \u2013 Rep. Luna\u00a0confirmed: \"I feel confident that we have enough evidence to move forward with our first field hearing. We will be announcing details soon.\"\nSeveral journalists have indicated that first-hand witnesses of the alleged UAP legacy programs are in the process of providing testimony/evidence to the relevant authorities (e.g. the IC IG) and/or are on the verge of making public statements in the near future (Example 1,\u00a0example 2,\u00a0example 3,\u00a0example 4)\nDavid Grusch has received additional clearances through\u00a0DOPSR\u00a0to discuss some of his (alleged)\u00a0first-hand knowledge of Legacy programs. He has mentioned he may be covering more of this information in an upcoming Op-Ed\nSome commentators\u00a0have speculated\u00a0that the architects of the UAPDA (e.g. Sens. Schumer/Rounds et al) are working diligently behind the scenes to continue furthering serious legislative UAP transparency efforts\n\nSkimmed through this post but need a quick refresher on how we got to this point?

My grandpa passed away more than two years ago and I had a lot of stress and grief in this period, so my account might not be 100% right but I'll try to be as detailed and clear as possible.\nMy grandpa passed away in april, 2022. A month before his death he got diagnosed with cancer somewhere in his abdomen, I'm not quite sure where it was but I personally don't want to know it. His diagnosis was way too late (doctors told him earlier it was nothing) and there wasn't anything they could do for him. He got to spend the first few weeks still at home, saying his goodbyes to friends and family, but later went to a beautiful hospice, with amazing volunteers. Seeing him deteriorate so fast really took a toll on me, especially since I was in the middle of my final examination. My grandpa had a lot of pain and eventually a decision was made to end his suffering. I hadn't seen my grandpa in like 2 days because the plan was that I wouldn't see him anymore, my goodbye somewhat already happened so we wouldn't see his further deterioration.\nThe day came and I was in school. I remember it clearly, I was in the auditorium getting a drink during lunchtime, and suddenly I got some sort of gut feeling that I really really REALLY wanted to see him one last time. They would give him medication so his breathing would stop at a random moment, or something among those lines, I never asked my mother for details. I called my mom and asked if the medication had already been given, and if I could see him for one more time. I was allowed to and I immidiately got my younger brother out of his class, and we both went to the hospice.\nI got my final goodbye there, hugged him a lot and told him that I was proud of him being my grandpa. He told me some things, but not everything was clear, his voice was real quiet. Still, with the things I did unsterstand, even to this day I'm so fricking happy I went to see him one last time. My mom, brother and me went home and while in the car a sad song came on the radio. We talked about the coincidence such a sad song would come on at that moment and about my random feeling that I still wanted that goodbye, mind, I had already gotten it and had fully accepted it up untill that moment. \nNow comes the most bizarre part. In the evening, my mother went to sleep in the hospice with my grandmother and my uncle, so they could be with their husband/father. Me, my brother and dad were all in my parents bed, trying to sleep, but anticipating the phone call that would end his suffering for good. We all cried, hugged, talked a bit, and tried to sleep. I remember laying there, thinking about a lot of things, mostly my grandpa, how my grandma was going to handle his death and who knows what. I just know I was pretty calm (it was after we all cried and hugged and we tried to relax), when suddenly, a thought popped into my head, and I began to cry intense. I looked at my younger brother and father and told them I knew my grandpa had passed. I don't know how I knew, how it happened, how it popped into my head, but I just knew, as if he had come to me himself to tell me. Not even five seconds after I told them he died, the phone rang and my crying mother told us that he passed. I panicked so hard, cried so hard, and just freaked out about the whole thing. About every coincident that I had deemed a coincidence, but this, this felt like more. Like something paranormal. I'm not a believer of the paranormal, and never had been, but that day changed me a bit. It gave me a different perspective. I just want to know if someone else has experienced something like this, or if someone has a theory for it.

This day started pretty normal. \nI was already on for like 10 minutes and 2 young girls (around 10-11) get on the bus and sat in the seats in front of me. Some minutes passed by and at the next stop a really creepy looking guy (around 50) got on and sat 2 rows in front of the 2 girls.\nHe had dirty clothes on and overall looked really unhygenic. Some minutes passed and i saw he always turns his head back and look at the girls that were sitting infront of me. It was already weird.\nAgain few minutes passed and i saw the guy getting out his phone and point it towards me and the two girls. Felt weird but suddenly i saw the flash on his phone. I was shocked but i thought maybe he just accidentally put the flash on. 2 minute passed and he did it again. At this point i felt disgusted and got up and went over there.\nI was angry and fueled with disgust, i asked him what the f*ck are you doing. He asked back what do i mean. I screamed at him in the middle of the bus, delete the pictures you took of the girls. He started to smile but in a really creepy way. He looked at me and told me he did took a photo but not of the girls. That was the moment the realization happened. The guy took photos of me. I was shocked and felt creeped out. I didnt know what to do, i just sat back in my seat and wait for the ride to arrive.\nFortunately the girls took off the next stop and the guy didnt. At this point i knew he really told the truth about taking pictures of me and not the girls. Me and the guy got off at the same stop but he didnt do nothing just stared at me.
