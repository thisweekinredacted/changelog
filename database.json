Here is the full and correct story:\nBruno Facchini, 40, is a mechanic, married, father of a young boy, lives in a colonial house in Abbiate Guazzone, Varese, Italy, a few miles from the motorway to Milan.\nOn 24th April 1950, at 10:00pm, the rain had just stopped after a violent thunderstorm, and he went outside his home to go to the toilet seat in a shack, and when he was about to return home after smoking a cigarette, he saw several strange flashing lights which at the time he thought were being generated by the storm, in a field adjacent to his home.\nHe decided to investigate anyway, because the lights were in the direction of a power line pole. The high voltage power line goes right over the village, and another of its poles is right in front of his home. He thought that a power cable may have fallen to the ground, which may explain the flashes, and he became afraid that his kid might get hurt if he grabbed it when playing outside the next day. He took a pathway that delimited the ground of a furnace and walked toward the place where he saw the flashing light, but saw nothing anymore. As he was about to go back to his home, he saw the lights again, and went in their direction again.\nHe told Antonio Giudicci:\n\"It was still a little farther. I decided to go there. Then I saw there a huge dark shape, like a ball, with a flattened top.\"\nHe saw that the dark object some 200 yards away, next to the power line pole. He estimated it to be 10 meters large and 7 meters high.\nHe told Antonio Giudicci:\n\"In the middle [of the shape] there was a small ladder, lightened by a green light. Almost immediately, I understood that the light came from some sort of lamp handled by a standing man who seemed to be engaged in welding. He wore something like a diving suit and a mask.\"\nLater he summarized for the press:\n\"Next to a power line pole and to a [gelso, ?] I saw a huge, round shape. From the illuminated disc, a ladder came down. A door opened. I could see inside the UFO, because a light diffused inside, there was another ladder leading to a higher level of the craft; on the walls, there were bottles connected together in rows and between them I could notice that there were gauges and tubes.\"\nHe told Antonio Giudicci:\n\"Driven by curiosity, at went closer, and I saw two other people, with the same clothing, moving slowly around the craft - I guessed that their diving suit was heavy and slowed down their movements. The craft, lighted by the welding tool, cast metallic reflections back.\"\nThe sparks Facchini had seen were pouring out of pipes; which one of the figure was working on with some type of device. The inside of the craft could be partially seen through an open vent. Inside were lots of dials and cylinders. The air around the craft was unusually warm and a buzzing sound like a giant beehive was heard constantly.\nAll the figures were similarly dressed in grayish one-piece tight fitting clothes and were wearing helmets but their faces were concealed behind masks from the front of which emerged one flexible pipe which reminded him of a breathing tube. Facchini later said he found them to be of the same size than human beings, about 1 meter 70.\nAt that time he thought that an aircraft in trouble because of the storm had landed and that the people were trying to do some repair, or maybe be some American pilots, repairing some new aircraft that failed and he did not know of. After watching for a while, he approached within four to five meters of the craft and offered his help:\nHe then started to realize they might not be American pilots, as the beings started to converse with each other and call him in \"a guttural language,\" and also because they moved with difficulties and made \"strange gestures\" at him, which he felt may be an offer to come aboard. The invitation and the realization that they were not human threw him in a state of panic.\nHe told Antonio Giudicci:\n\"I offered to help, but the only answer I received were some guttural sounds that were not understandable. I wondered what their intentions were. I had the feeling they were inviting me aboard. Suddenly I heard an uproar, like the amplified buzz of a bee, or a huge power generator. I saw another ladder in the interior of the craft, and all around, tubes, cylinders, and gauges. I understood that this was not a plane, and I was seized by panic, I started to run away.\"\n\"I was not so close anymore when I turned my head back. I saw one of the men raise some sort of apparatus he carried at his side and beam a ray of light in my direction. I started to run again, but immediately, I felt as if I was cut in two parts by some cutting tool or by a jet of compressed air and I fell flat.\"\nLater he told to the press:\n\"After a while I saw four beings around the disc. Two were beside the ladder. A third one seemed to attempt to weld together a group of tubes. Exactly this operation produced the strange flashing that had attracted my attention. Thinking that this was some test of a secret prototype, I approached them asking if they had need for help. The beings started to make strange gestures and emitted guttural sounds, something like \"gurr... gurr...\" At that moment the craft was started and it was only then that I understood that they were not human beings. Seized by panic, I started to run away. While I ran, I had a glimpse at them and I saw that one of those individuals was directing something at me.\"\nHe felt pushed to the ground for several yards and knocked down. Later he said it was like feeling a strong discharge and a burning sensation on the skin of his abdomen. He stayed on the ground but looked what was going on.\nLeft: Bruno Facchini showing his jacket and shoes\nhe wore on the night of the encounter.\nSource: Italian newspaper Domenica del Corrierre.\nShortly afterwards, when the repairs has apparently been completed, the \"American pilots\" then returned to their craft, a trap through which light had been shining was closed and the craft took off sideways, making a heavy buzzing sound.\nHe told Antonio Giudicci:\n\"They seemed not to be interested in my anymore. I am convinced they only wanted to scare me and had no intention to do anything wrong to me.\" \"They were busy in removing the scaffold and withdrawing the ladder. Then the door closed. All the lights went out. And the buzzing sound continued. Suddenly the sound became louder. The craft took off, gained speed and disappeared.\"\nLater he told to the press:\n\"I was hit at the back by a light beam, and it had such a force that I felt pushed. I lost my equilibrium and I hit the ground, knocking my head against a stone. Hurt, scared and [intontito. ?], I stayed on the ground without moving. In the meantime those beings were finishing their welding job. Then they all entered in the disc, it closed and went away.\"\nHe stayed on the ground for a while, looking at the sky. Everything was silent again. Finally he went back home, and unsurprisingly he could not sleep very well that night.\nThe following day Facchini returned to the site, because he had lost his cigarette box there when he fell. He noticed that there were some traces and four circular depressions of one-meter diameter each, arranged in a square pattern of 6 meters side length. The grass around it is burnt and lots of pieces of melted metal are on the ground.\n\"The next morning, after a sleepless night, I went back to the location and I found four wide circular traces, a meter wide each. The grass in it was burnt. on various places on the ground, there were pieces of metal.\"\nLeft: Bruno Facchini showing one of the fragments\n\nhe picked up on the site on the next day.\nSource: Italian newspaper \"Domenica del Corriere.\"\nFacchini then went to the police headquarters of Varese and an investigation was carried out by unmotivated policemen there and also allegedly by military technicians (the presence of military technician may well be an exaggeration of the Press.)\nThe police went on location and saw the ground traces, and Facchini or the police handled the debris who were sent to the research institute for the studies of metals in Novara. The institute examined the samples and merely said they were heat-resistant, antifriction metal, which were commented as \"would be ideal in space flight to face the burn-up as the craft entered the Earth's atmosphere,\" although it is not clear who made that comment.\nSeveral days after the encounter, Facchini estimated he was hurt enough to justify a visit to an MD. The MD found that Facchini had a blackened mark where the beam hit him, and this mark grew until it covered his entire back, causing him pains for a whole month. Because he was thrown to the ground when hit by the beam, he also had several normal wounds.\nThe next year, some of the debris are examined again by Renato Vesco, from Genova, one of the very first Italian private UFO investigator, and Vesco concluded the samples are essentially bronze with an elevated percentage of pond and some traces of lead.\nFacchini said he never really recovered psychologically. Many ufologists visited him time and time again, to check if he really told the story they read in ufological publications, and he always did, with no changes in the account.\nIn 1981, Italian ufologist Ezio Bernardini met him, and re-interviewed him. Nothing in the story had changed. Facchini told him that when he saw the moon landings on TV, he was stunned that the astronauts' suits reminded him to the suits of his visitors. He described their clothing as \"diving suits\" in 1950, but now he understood that they were \"space suits\" or earth-landing suits if you will.\nA Navy officer reported a conversation with Facchini:\n\"You are really a luck one! I would have given a lot to be able to admire shat you saw, this technological marvel!\"\nFacchini's answer was bitter.\n\"Lucky, Me? If I had known how much trouble I would get from this experience, I would not have said one word about it, guaranteed!\"\nSource 1:Ufo e alieni in italy by Moreno Tambellini\nSources 2: https://ufologie.patrickgross.org/htm/abbiateguazzone.htm", "media": null, "score": 210, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comment_count": 20, "over_18": false}, "10": {"id": "1h3sb9m", "locked": false, "subreddit": "cryptids", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "wrapityup", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1733541129.237955, "created_utc": 1733017994.0, "url": "https://v.redd.it/zmhq83k6854e1", "title": "Spotted the \"Alaskan Killer Bigfoot\" of Portlock, Alaska in the background of this scene", "permalink": "/r/cryptids/comments/1h3sb9m/spotted_the_alaskan_killer_bigfoot_of_portlock/", "selftext": "It went unnoticed in the show ", "media": {"reddit_video": {"bitrate_kbps": 5000, "fallback_url": "https://v.redd.it/zmhq83k6854e1/DASH_1080.mp4?source=fallback", "has_audio": true, "height": 1080, "width": 1920, "scrubber_media_url": "https://v.redd.it/zmhq83k6854e1/DASH_96.mp4", "dash_url": "https://v.redd.it/zmhq83k6854e1/DASHPlaylist.mpd?a=1736133128%2COTBkMTA5YjhlM2E4NDQ2MzkxZDdlYjgwNzZlYzRiNDg0YmMzOTQzMDk0MzBmMjdlYmRjZGIyYzgwMGVlYmFjYQ%3D%3D&v=1&f=sd", "duration": 37, "hls_url": "https://v.redd.it/zmhq83k6854e1/HLSPlaylist.m3u8?a=1736133128%2CYTUzMTY5NWVkNjc5ZjBjYWNkYjVhMGFjZWMxMjQ3YzFkYTk2OTllNmQyZDBhOGQzYmNlMDc4MDJkMmQwYmU3OA%3D%3D&v=1&f=sd", "is_gif": false, "transcoding_status": "completed"}}, "score": 274, "upvote_ratio": 0.74, "comment_count": 78, "over_18": false}, "11": {"id": "1h76eqx", "locked": false, "subreddit": "thetruthishere", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "PinballBallpin", "link_flair_text": "Legend/Folklore", "time": 1733541129.470284, "created_utc": 1733395451.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1h76eqx/lost_fairy_photo_story/", "title": "Lost Fairy Photo Story", "permalink": "/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1h76eqx/lost_fairy_photo_story/", "selftext": "During my early highschool years I would study at my desk facing the window with a desk lamp.

Ever since we moved into this house, there\u2019s been this small room in the basement that\u2019s always locked. To show you how little anyone uses it, I don\u2019t even know what\u2019s in there, but I\u2019ve always assumed it\u2019s just utility stuff like meters or something. The room is really tiny, barely big enough to lie down in.\nNow, let\u2019s get into it. My parents went away for a weekend together, leaving me, my older sister, and my baby brother (who was just a few weeks old at the time) at home. My parents trusted us to take care of ourselves since they\u2019d done this before. Anyway, that night my sister went out with friends and wasn\u2019t planning to come back until 4 or 5 in the morning. I watched a good movie and, since it was already getting late, I decided to put my little brother to bed in his room upstairs. I did that and came back down to watch another movie, but I ended up falling asleep.\nAbout two or three hours later, around midnight, I woke up to these strange noises coming from upstairs. At first, I thought it was just the neighbors since they can be pretty loud and the walls are thin. But then I looked at the time and realized it was too late for them to still be awake, let alone making that kind of noise. So, I got closer to the stairs to investigate, and just as I was about to go up the first step, I heard the sound of something metal falling on the ground. Guess what? It was the key to the small room in the basement.\nI immediately grabbed my phone, and instead of calling the police, I texted my friends to tell them what was happening. One of my friends had the brilliant idea of calling the police for me. Suddenly, I heard the bathroom door slam shut. I knew it was that door because it makes a very specific creaking noise when it closes. I remembered my brother was sleeping upstairs, so I carefully went up to check if he was okay. Thankfully, he was fine.\nStill not fully grasping how much danger I was in, I went to the bathroom door. Since it opens inward, I decided to violently push it open\u2014and I heard a man scream. I immediately shut the door and held it closed to keep him from getting out. He broke the window, and outside the bathroom, there\u2019s this sort of balcony\u2014not a proper one, but you get the idea\u2014that connects to the balconies of the neighboring houses, which are all really close together. He used that to escape.\nI grabbed my brother in my arms, ran to the kitchen, and noticed that one of the knives was missing from the knife block. I picked up another knife and crouched in a corner of the living room, crying like never before. The police arrived, and I opened the door for them.\nWhen they searched the house, they confirmed that the bathroom window was broken, and I had hit the guy so hard that there was blood on the floor. But the most shocking and traumatizing part was what they found in that small basement room. There were blankets and cans of food. They concluded that he had been living there for several days...\nThat\u2019s it. I hesitated a lot before posting this because it really affected me, and I\u2019m sorry if the story isn\u2019t super clear\u2014some of the details are still jumbled in my head.

I live in Georgia. Anyways, the restaurant is closed Sundays and Mondays and she was covering for someone on the hotel side until 11:30 pm. She was cleaning and was going in and out of the restaurant because that\u2019s where the coffee is and she replaces the coffee every couple hours so the lights were still on. Well she was just watching the cameras because she was expecting 2 check ins and all of a sudden something caught her eye from inside the restaurant. She immediately called the guy that was going to be working starting at 11:30 to see if he can come right away and was going to lock herself in her office because it apparently shook her to her core. The guy came 4 minutes later (I guess because my mom was going to have a heart attack) this \u201cfigure\u201d was still there and even the guy saw it on the camera so when they went in the restaurant nothing was there. They looked everywhere and when they went back to look at the camera this \u201cfigure\u201d was gone. I feel bad for my mom.

We live in southern Arizona and are all staying the night st one friends house for a birthday party. Her house is known between all of us as the \"haunted house\" since we're always experiencing weird things there. But this time, right after the sun had set, we were sitting on the porch in the backyard when one of us yelled and pointed at the chest-high brick fence, saying that she just saw a bald white human head poke itself over the fence. Two of us  immediately ran over and looked over the fence to see nothing. We laughed that off, but it was the first sighting of the night. We hung out outside a little longer until we decided to check over the fence again, and while we were doing so, we heard scuttering on the outside of the fence out of view. We joked about it and just went inside instead. Skip to a while later we went outside again and almost right away someone saw a head pop up around another fence, again we all thought It was nothing, but more of us started seeing a head, hands, and part of a back. At that point we were scared as hell and started going back inside when one friend STAYED BACK AND SCARED THE LIVING SHIT OIT OF US, but she was just standing and looking, we stayed there for a while (now with one friend holding a broom, they lost their broom privileges soon after) and we kept seeing small things of white and some of the same things from before. Our other friends (previously inside) came out again SCARING THE SHIT OUT OF US and we all started talking about things we saw and what it could be when we kept seeing things. And eventually 2 people heard a growling and it was very clear they both weren't faking and we all ran inside and started panicking, trying to reason with the fact there was a skinny bald white man crawling outside. We eventually found this and thank goodness because believe it or not it made us all feel much better. This was our story. Believe it or not\nDo you think it's real or are we just crazy teenagers?

It started with a disturbing dream my mom had the night before. Her boyfriend at the time, who worked as a security guard at the local hospital, shared what happened the next morning, and it left us both shaken.\nHe told me that around three or four A.M., he was up early, getting ready for work. He was sipping his coffee and half-watching random shows on TV when he began to hear whispering. At first, it was faint but distinctly aggressive, almost like it was right outside the front door of the apartment. Confused by the timing and tone, he got up to check. But as he approached the door, the sound stopped. Thinking it was nothing, he went back to his coffee and TV.\nThen it happened again. This time, the whispering was louder\u2014clearer\u2014and unmistakably coming from right outside the front door. Feeling a mix of curiosity and irritation, he moved quickly to open the door and look around, but again, there was nothing. No one in sight, no sounds.\nHe shrugged it off as odd but not impossible, until it happened a third time. Only this time, there was no whispering. Instead, he heard a deep, guttural man\u2019s voice almost yelling\u2014and it was coming from my mother\u2019s room.\nPanicked, he ran to her room and swung the door open. My mom was laying in bed, speaking in a man\u2019s voice he couldn\u2019t recognize. The words were garbled and unintelligible, but the tone was dark and commanding. He flipped on the light, shouting at her to wake up, and she eventually did\u2014shaken and confused.\nShe told him she\u2019d been having a nightmare about a shadowy figure trying to force itself on her. She described the figure as something dark and menacing, unlike anything she\u2019d ever dreamed before.\nAs her boyfriend was telling me this the next day, we were both sitting in the apartment kitchen. He was just reaching the part about the yelling when suddenly, the lights in the kitchen went out\u2014except for one. The timing was too perfect to dismiss. Both of us froze, adrenaline spiking, and without even saying much, we grabbed our things and left the apartment in a hurry.\nWhen we came back later, everything was normal. All the lights were working fine, and nothing else strange happened after that. To this day, I can\u2019t help but wonder what exactly was going on that night. \nI get chills retelling this one to this day. An unnerving feeling.

I arrived back to my house around midnight. \nI live alone in a shared but divided house, with 2 other tenants living inside. One is upstairs and one splits the downstairs with me so there\u2019s 3 apartments total. My place is in the back of the house and has a back porch you can enter through  after walking up the whole driveway.\nWhen I got home, I sat in my bedroom and did about 20-30 minutes of work on my computer. During this time, the house was very quiet and I kept hearing a man\u2019s voice continuously talking. Now, keep in mind, the tenant above me is a man and I know his bedroom is right above mine because I previously lived up there. It sounded like he was talking on the phone, just because of how long and continuous the talking went on. I tried to listen and figure out where the voice was coming from and I couldn\u2019t exactly pinpoint it, but it was either coming from through the ceiling or on other side of my room. Now, it must be noted that my bedroom connects to the porch with a door that I have blocked with my dresser. There\u2019s a main door inside the porch that you use to get into the house but there\u2019s also this strange door connecting to my room.\nI couldn\u2019t make out the words, but because of how firm and continuous the voice was going on, I figured it just had to be coming from my housemate upstairs. It\u2019s the only thing that made logical sense. I just kept on thinking though, I had never heard a single voice come through that ceiling before. It\u2019s not that thin. Whatever, I\u2019m worrying about nothing. \nAfter about 20-30 minutes of computer work, I got up to go to brush my teeth, feed my fish, get ready for bed, etc. I come back into my room , turn off the lights and get in bed. Keep in mind it\u2019s been about 45-60 minutes since I first heard the voice and I could still hear it. Damn, I thought. My housemate is chatting up a storm on the phone up there. Oh, how wrong I was! \nAfter about 3 minutes of laying in bed, I all of the sudden heard my porch door creaking along with the talking mans voice. It has a very distinct sound that I knew immediately was my porch door. I crept across my room and put my ear to the dresser/the door that connects to the porch. Sure enough, the talking was coming from inside my porch and I could hear the door moving and shuffling inside my porch along with it. My heart absolutely dropped. \nAll the lights were off in my house at this point, so I had a sort of sneaky advantage to creep around my house and get a view of what was going on. I crept down my hallway and peered into the kitchen, which the porch leads into. Across the kitchen, through the door and in a streak of moonlight, I just see a man with long , scraggly hair sitting curled up in the center of my porch turned around with his back to me, muttering out loud to himself and rocking back and forth. My fight or flight kicked in and I immediately ripped open the door and started screaming at him to get out and try intimidating him. Looking back, I probably shouldn\u2019t have made myself so vulnerable without a weapon handy, but like I said I was just in fight or flight I can\u2019t explain my actions in this moment other than reacting out of fear and determination to scare him out. \nAnyways, this dude didn\u2019t even react to me whipping open the door and screaming at him. Not even a flinch. He simply turned his head to the side very slowly and said \u201cmy name is Evan.\u201d This freaked me out so much for some reason, especially because he STILL hadn\u2019t turned around or shown his face. I said I don\u2019t care and kept cursing at him to leave and he slowly rose up with his hands up and said \u201cI know, I know. I\u2019m hiding.\u201d He wasnt saying it in a pleading way though. He said it with this almost childlike, playful tone that freaked me the absolute fuck out. I hated this. \nThe fact that he kept trying to reason with me and act so mysterious while still not even turning around to show his face just pissed me off honestly. Who do you think you are bro? I ran him out of the porch and was just threatening him. Now I assume it was just a homeless man who was under the influence of something, as I do live in an inner city area and it\u2019s common to see homeless people near my street, but idk man. the sight of seeing him in my porch and knowing he was in there for at least an hour beforehand while I was sitting right there just freaked me the fuck out. I was in full blown defense mode by the time I opened that door and I wasn\u2019t willing to waste any time to do a character dive on the guy. No imaginable situation would permit anyone to be in my porch like that at that hour. \nNeedless to say, I\u2019ll be double checking my porch lock every night from now on lol. It\u2019s funny because having my room connected to the porch, I always had this horrific intrusive thought that I\u2019d hear someone in there one night. Looks like it came true! \nSo, please, Evan, let\u2019s not ever meet again you creepy bastard!!

It was clear as day what he was doing and at that point I was si distracted from my speech that I stopped talking. Of course everyone listening noticed and followed my gaze to the back of the roomx where the man sat. He stopped vibrating and I could have sworn I saw a sheaf of nugat shooting up from his lap. My father got up and yelled at him, fo which he fled right out of the building. Male family members chased him down the halls but he managed to get away. Police were called and they searched the local area but found nothing. He wasn't caught on camera either, since this happened in rural Bulgaria where survelliance is not very common.\nHonestly we are all still shaken up but we are getting through it.

One night, around 10 PM, my stepfather called to tell me that our childhood dog had run away from his townhouse on the other side of town. He asked if I could help search for the dog, and I agreed.\nWhen I got to his place, we came up with a plan of attack. For some reason, I decided to check near my old high school. It was about a mile and a half from his townhouse. While it seemed unlikely the dog could\u2019ve made it that far, something just told me to go.\nI turned onto the service road that led to the two entrances of the school. The road ended in a dead end, so I made a U-turn to head back. As I drove, I glanced up at the stars. That\u2019s when I noticed something unusual\u2014a star that was shining far brighter than the rest.\nI did a double take, and almost instinctively, I said out loud, \u201cWhat the fuck is that?\u201d\nThe moment the words left my mouth, the \u201cstar\u201d seemed to react. It hit what I can only describe as a warp drive and shot off in a straight line, disappearing completely from view. It wasn\u2019t a shooting star\u2014I know what those look like. Shooting stars don\u2019t sit still before launching off like that.\nWhat stuck with me the most was the trail it left behind. It\u2019s hard to describe, but along the short path it took looked like a ring, almost like the ones around Saturn. The ring was small forming from the point of where it was sitting and ending where is seemingly ceased to exist. The ring quickly faded into glowing embers, like the kind you\u2019d see rising from a campfire.\nI had stopped my car and was just standing there feeling the adrenaline fade, asking myself. What the fuck was that? Why did it seemingly react to me doing a double take? Why don\u2019t I have a dash camera? \nStill standing outside my car, frozen in disbelief, my phone rang. It was my stepfather, asking where I was. I told him I was on my way back to help with the search, still reeling from what I\u2019d just seen.\nWe eventually found the dog just a neighborhood over. But that night\u2014what I saw in the sky\u2014I\u2019ll never forget.\nThere was a UFO video floating around on r/UFOs. It showed a boat dock camera capturing something moving extremely fast. The trail the object left was pretty close to what I had witnessed that night. I\u2019ll try and find it and post below.

I live in a small town in Oklahoma, and in my neighborhood the houses are fairly spread apart, separated by woods. \nIt was a school day so my grandma picked me up from school, and brought me home. This was the first year that I got dropped off at my house alone. Before this I would just go to my grandmas house after school. I would get dropped off at around 3:00pm, and my parents would be home around 4:30. Not that big of a deal. \nToday for some reason, my dad wasn\u2019t going to be home until later (around 7), and my mom, a teacher, wouldn\u2019t be home until around 8pm because she had parent-teacher conferences at the school. This happened in early fall, so it wouldn\u2019t even be dark until like 8:30pm. \nI did what I usually did when I got home. I ran upstairs, got on my Xbox 360, and played Minecraft with my friends. Today it was just me and my friends Seth. I was playing for about 2 hours when I heard a car door shut in my driveway. No one should have been here until like 7pm. My house is set up to where my upstairs has windows that look over my driveway. So with my mic on, and controller in hand, I went to the window to see who it was. Maybe my dad got home earlier than expected. \nI looked outside. It was a red truck. No one I know drives a red truck. The person pulled in to the middle of my driveway sideways. Like he owned the place. When I looked out the window, I saw a man with a hat, wearing a big camo hoodie and jeans. It was September, so no one should have been wearing a big hoodie and jeans in Oklahoma. By the time I looked he was already almost out of view, going up my walkway to my front door. I thought maybe it was one of my dad\u2019s friends, or someone my dad hired to do something. But he would usually tell me if someone was going to be coming over.\nSoon after, I hear a knock at the door. Then another. I go to my other window that has a better view of the walkway up to my front door. I see the guy walking back down the walkway. I switch and go back to looking through the windows overlooking my driveway. I\u2019m relaying all of this to Seth still with my mic on. I tell Seth that he\u2019s walking back to his truck now. Instead, he walks past his truck and tries to open my garage side door. At this point my heart sinks. I tell Seth that this guy just tried to get into my house. Mind you, it is literally broad day at like 5pm. Luckily it was locked because sometimes we forget to lock it.\nAfter he tried the door, he starts walking to my back patio. I drop my headset and I quietly run down stairs to see what he is doing. I get downstairs and stand behind the wall so I\u2019m not visible from the back door/living room windows. I just listen. I hear him try to open the door. Then I hear a thud. It sounded like he dropped a brick on the ground or something. At this point Im more scared than I\u2019ve ever been. I wanted to call my parents or grandma but I didn\u2019t have a cell phone yet. The only phone in the house was in my kitchen. I would have to cross my living room to get there, and he would be able to see me if I went into there. A few seconds after the thud, I peeked around the corner and he was gone. \nI run back upstairs and put my headset back on telling Seth that he just tried to open the back door as well. As I\u2019m telling him this I hear a car door shut. This time when I look out the window he finally got in his truck. I looked at the truck closer and I notice the only thing he has in his truck bed was a crowbar and shovel. He sat in his truck for what felt like a few minutes. During this time Seth told me to get my iPod and take a picture of his license plate. He was parked to where I couldn\u2019t see it. Then he drove backwards out of my driveway, and down the road. \nA few minutes after he was confirmed gone, I went downstairs to see what the thud could have been. I get to the back door and see that the door mat was moved. Both big plant pots had been moved as well. He was looking for a key. Holy fuck. We have a hidden key back there too. The key to the back door was under one of the smaller plant pots on a ledge near the door, not the bigger ones that he had checked under. I went to the front porch and all the pots looked like they had been moved too. \nI don\u2019t know what I would have done if he was able to find the key, or if he just broke in.\nAfter he left I called my dad and told him what happened. When my dad got home he had a cop come over and I told him what happened and gave him a description. The guy never came back.

Everyone on my block is super friendly, I wave to everyone & ask how their day is doing.  Well this newlywed couple moved in across the street (Not directly across but across and 3 houses south of mine)  The husband was 26-27 but dude never waved.  So I am walking my dog and he's cutting the grass, I say screw it and Wave hello, it was like I was a ghost.  Seemed bitter always.   After the wake I come home and my neighbor tells me \"holy sh-t I have never seen so many cop cars/ambulances and those white vans at the house of the newlyweds.  Well it was about 9 pm and those white sprinter vans were still there.  So I go walk my dog in that direction cause I am nosey and they are identical sprinter vans, never seen em before. (also the lawn mower is still in the middle of the lawn)   Usually that couple parked their cars in the driveway because his garage was dedicated to those moto cross motorcycles, he had 3-4 of them in there.  Again never saw 2 identical sprinter vans with only windows on the doors & Back doors.  Nothing is out of the usual, both their cars are parked infront of the garage.  About 2-3 weeks later I see 2 big trucks and they are loading the motorcycles on there and I can see an older women crying & shouting back at the wife, and I believe the wife's mother was there cause she was shouting back.  It just looked like a miserable scene so I kept walking.   Well a few days after this a different neighbor tells me did you hear what happened?  I said no I just heard about all the cop cars/ambulances/etc  well it turns out the dude just stopped mowing the grass, went inside and blew his head off w/ I imagine a shotgun.  The 2 sprinter vans were clean up crews.   As we are talking our other neighbor joins the conversation (he lives directly next door to the suicide house)  Turns out they fought like cats and dogs, he said he could always hear em screaming and the kid was a airline mechanic so he made good money but he just blew his head off.  So thats when I thought ohhhh, I bet the people who came for his motorcycles were his family and taking all his personal stuff and I was right.  The wife still lived there for about 7-8 months before selling the house.  Takes about 2-3 months to sell and we have new neighbors.  I dont think anything of it and I am talking to the guy who lives next door to the suicide house and he's n older guy, straight shooter he asks me if I believe in Ghosts I said no why?   Well the new neighbor asked him if something bad happened there, and he told them yes a suicide.  Then the new neighbor explains to the neighbor I am friends with, water faucets get turned on, non stop banging of kitchen cabinets, he comes from work and hangs his keys right at the door and they are missing.  His wife is scared to be there, and apparently the realtor doesnt have to disclose murders/suicides unless the client asks?   Well they lasted 9 months or so and it was up for sale.  I don't want to drag the story on further but the suicide happened 9 years ago and in those 9 years that house has had 7  people living there(Soon to be Eight, the house has a SOLD  sign on it now)   I saw that neighbor again who lives directly next door to the suicide house and I asked him out of those 7 people who lived there how many asked if something had happened at that house?  He told me 3 out of the 7 asked him if something strange happened, the other 4 kept to themselves.   The house is probably worth 300-350k and I looked to see what it sold for and it sold for 250k (85k below market value according to zillow)  That is what got me to believe in ghosts/hauntings.  I never bought a house before, the house I live in was left to me.  My question is, (for those who have bought houses) cant they see how many people lived in the house in a short period of time??  Also wouldn't someone be like why is the house for sale for so cheap?  and if they ask that question does the realtor have to say a suicide happened here even though its not a direct question?  It's really creepy cuz I can literally walk to the house from where I am laying in less than 30 seconds.", "media": null, "score": 76, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "comment_count": 15, "over_18": false}, "68": {"id": "1h86yma", "locked": false, "subreddit": "glitchinthematrix", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Wholesomerkid", "link_flair_text": "Glitch Pic", "time": 1733541169.3566658, "created_utc": 1733506815.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/36wwtjjrl95e1.jpeg", "title": "Pixelated shadow??", "permalink": "/r/GlitchInTheMatrix/comments/1h86yma/pixelated_shadow/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.21, "comment_count": 6, "over_18": false}}}
