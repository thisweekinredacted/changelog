Here's what my wife and I saw last night 9/28/2024 at 8:15PM Mountain Time, clear sky, in the Black Hills of SD.\nI'm an astrophotographer, so I'm well-versed in what a typical night sky looks like in terms of high and low earth satellites, Starlink, northern lights, rocket launches, and military craft (we have a major Air Force base in Rapid City). I\u2019m familiar with these because they often interfere with my astro shots, and I\u2019m outside enough to notice them. The night sky between here and Wyoming is usually clear and stunning. That being said, what my wife and I both saw last night made our jaws drop. There is simply no man-made explanation for what we witnessed.\nMy wife and I were stargazing in our backyard around 8:15 PM Mountain Time when I personally noticed something odd: an orb with a gray haze surrounding it shot across the sky in about 6 seconds. It looked incredibly strange, and I mentioned it to my wife, who missed it. I tried to convince myself that maybe I was just seeing things, but then, as I pointed out the area I saw it in, a massive right-angle-shaped craft appeared from the northwest and crossed the sky to the east in about 10 seconds. It wasn\u2019t V-shaped per se, but rather a perfect right angle.\nTo my eyes, the craft seemed to be in the upper atmosphere or low orbit, and it had to be the size of multiple football fields. There were a few planes in the sky, and this was way higher than those, but not as high as Starlink satellites, at least from what I could tell. What made it even stranger was the clearly visible under-lights, which were white and structured. Surrounding the lights was almost a grayish-white hazy aura, giving it an ethereal appearance. The whole craft, for lack of a better term, looked almost like a ghost ship with that eerie aura. When it passed above us, you could see both the lights and the structure. It moved silently, like a stingray gliding through the sky, smooth and quick and did not change directions. We only had about 10 seconds to observe it, just enough to grasp what we were looking at. Even if we had our astro gear set up, it wouldn\u2019t have been a good enough shot to capture it because it moved too quickly and would have been blurry.\nBased on my experience, satellites can take up to 2-5 minutes to cross the sky, but this took only 10 seconds and had a visible structure. It had to be moving at an incredible speed, way faster than any military aircraft in our area and faster than any satellite. I would estimate it was about 3 times slower than a typical shooting star.\nMy wife and I both confirmed what we saw. To avoid influencing each other\u2019s perspective, we went inside and drew what we saw without sharing until we were done. We depicted the same craft. Later, we made a Photoshop image of it, which I\u2019ll attach here below.\nBased on my research, a typical Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite travels at about 7.8 km/s (approximately 17,500 mph) and takes around 5 minutes (300 seconds) to cross the sky, covering a distance of roughly 2,340 km. In contrast, the object I observed covered a similar distance in just 10 seconds, meaning it was moving at an incredible speed of about 234 km/s, or 523,440 mph. To put this into perspective, the fastest known spy plane, the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird, publicly has a top speed of over 2,200 mph. This means the object I saw was moving at speeds approximately 238 times faster than our fastest aircraft.\nPersonally I feel like the only way you could capture what we saw would have been with some type of combination of night vision goggles and a high-speed camera, and be extremely lucky to be pointing at the right part of the sky for that brief moment. There's absolutely no way a cell phone camera could capture this, not even my Sony A7 III astro setup either. This is because it would require a long exposure shot, and with that speed, it would of just been a smear.\nOur minds are blown, it's kinda hard to go back to normal work after seeing this.\nI used photoshop to try to show what we saw.\nMy wife's picture recall on the left, mine on the right (I'm a bad artist).\nOff topic just some astro pictures up here lately", "media": null, "score": 3012, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "comment_count": 411, "over_18": false}, "3": {"id": "1fs41a2", "locked": false, "subreddit": "aliens", "stickied": false, "category": "Aliens", "author": "JuliaJune96", "link_flair_text": "shitpost sunday:snoo_trollface: (Sundays Only)", "time": 1728097164.3047402, "created_utc": 1727615528.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/7f0v6jayzqrd1.jpeg", "title": "When humans finally learn telepathy ", "permalink": "/r/aliens/comments/1fs41a2/when_humans_finally_learn_telepathy/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 2571, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comment_count": 91, "over_18": false}, "4": {"id": "1ft823n", "locked": false, "subreddit": "uap", "stickied": false, "category": "Aliens", "author": "Vaiken_Vox", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1728097164.5654385, "created_utc": 1727733981.0, "url": "https://v.redd.it/enrr37ucwyrd1", "title": "The Program (Trailer) Directed by James Fox", "permalink": "/r/UAP/comments/1ft823n/the_program_trailer_directed_by_james_fox/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 102, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comment_count": 7, "over_18": false}, "5": {"id": "1fuhm86", "locked": false, "subreddit": "conspiracy", "stickied": false, "category": "Consipiracy", "author": "AshleyMyers44", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1728097165.9473798, "created_utc": 1727879568.0, "url": "https://i.imgur.com/mKmrNcD.jpeg", "title": "Was pop star Sia trying to send a coded message about Beyonce and P Diddy?", "permalink": "/r/conspiracy/comments/1fuhm86/was_pop_star_sia_trying_to_send_a_coded_message/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 8847, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "comment_count": 818, "over_18": false}, "6": {"id": "1frvkhh", "locked": false, "subreddit": "conspiracyfact", "stickied": false, "category": "Consipiracy", "author": "AnthonyofBoston", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1728097166.1087785, "created_utc": 1727581188.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracyfact/comments/1frvkhh/a_look_at_the_paramilitary_rank_and_file_of_mars/", "title": "A look at the paramilitary rank and file of Mars 360", "permalink": "/r/conspiracyfact/comments/1frvkhh/a_look_at_the_paramilitary_rank_and_file_of_mars/", "selftext": "A look at the paramilitary rank and file of Mars 360\u00a0https://www.academia.edu/114910170/The_Mars_360_Paramilitary_rank_and_file", "media": null, "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "comment_count": 0, "over_18": false}, "7": {"id": "1frc6x9", "locked": false, "subreddit": "bigfoot", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "glittertitzmcgee", "link_flair_text": "merchandise", "time": 1728097166.8817723, "created_utc": 1727522846.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1frc6x9", "title": "Love my new bag!!

Of course I had looked her up on social media and I knew what she looked like, but that was about all. We had never actually met. She was never that active on social media so there wasn't a lot I could see.\nOut of nowhere one day in my first year of law school, I got a friend request on Facebook from my sister. Her profile seemed legitimate, she had Facebook friends, and her profile picture looked like her.\nShe sent me a message inviting me to a little dinner party at the park with her friends. We could finally meet each other for the first time. I was new to LA (still am) and I had no idea which parts of the city to avoid at night.\nI was so excited about that idea, but I had a lot of anxiety about it too. It would be nice if we met, totally clicked, and became besties for life. But what if we ended up sobbing like we were in some dramatic movie scene? What if I tried to talk with her, and she just didn't click with me, and she started showing me an attitude? Or worse\u2014what if it's all going well until we have some kind of disagreement, someone said something hurtful, and then we were both crying in front of everyone?\nHonestly, if she had suggested a cozy little bakery for desserts instead, I would have gone. But going to a park with other people didn't feel right. I thought it was like such a precious moment that I didn\u2019t want to have in front of all these other people.\nI couldn\u2019t bring myself to go. I didn\u2019t want to risk having a meltdown in front of other people. I was worried about how messy it could get.\nA few weeks later, I googled that park just to see what it was like. Maybe we could meet up there together, just one on one. That's when I learned something was wrong.\nI won't say the name of the park, but anyone who has lived in LA for long will tell you that it's NOT a safe place for girls to be having a dinner party at night. The area surrounding that park has very high violent crime rates. It's controlled by gangs. Even people who do illegal business in that park are forced to pay a \"tax\" to the gang in exchange for being left alone.\nSo now I was really concerned and curious.\nI actually tried to get ahold of my sister myself. She was an undergrad at the time, a local college. I had a friend who went to her school. I asked my friend to reach out to her on campus and ask her if she'd be ok with meeting us. They connected and the three of us met at my friend's house.\nIt was great. We got along so well. My friend was also very happy to do that for us. The three of us had so much fun. We weren't bursting in tears but we let out a few. We had dinner, we watched a movie, and we spent the night at my friend's house.\nWhen I told my sister about that whole thing, she said she hadn\u2019t used Facebook since high school\u2014so clearly someone was impersonating her. I would have told her to report the fake account but it had already been deleted.\nShe knew she had been impersonated on social media though. Another one of her friends had been scammed by someone pretending to be her. It was some scheme involving fake concert tickets or something like that.\nSomeone had been impersonating my sister; they knew I was in town, and they literally tried to lure me into one of the most dangerous parts of LA at night. I have no idea what their motives were. I don't know if I even want to find out.\nMeeting my sister after all these years was a beautiful thing but the whole backdrop was terrifying.", "media": null, "score": 280, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comment_count": 9, "over_18": true}, "13": {"id": "1fv9rbu", "locked": false, "subreddit": "truecreepy", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "AtmanDharma", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1728097169.2396724, "created_utc": 1727967516.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/t35ce96l2ksd1.jpeg", "title": "Former model and Miss Switzerland finalist Kristina Joksimovic 'pureed' in blender by husband", "permalink": "/r/truecreepy/comments/1fv9rbu/former_model_and_miss_switzerland_finalist/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 299, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comment_count": 38, "over_18": false}, "14": {"id": "1fsg7ip", "locked": false, "subreddit": "threekings", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "elegant_mango__", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1728097169.3636794, "created_utc": 1727647899.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/threekings/comments/1fsg7ip/i_need_help_from_someone_with_experience_urgent/", "title": "I need help from someone with experience (URGENT)", "permalink": "/r/threekings/comments/1fsg7ip/i_need_help_from_someone_with_experience_urgent/", "selftext": "I have a friend who's REALLY obsessed with a boy who's not only straight, but in a relationship with a very nice girl, me and my other friends tell him all the time to stop with this and move on, but he won't listen, but the reason I'm asking in this subreddit is simple, my friend is doing those little rituals to make the boy fall in love with him (I think it's called sympathy or smth).\nI'm not sure of what he did specifically, but it involves writing names on papers, blood and re-doing it a few times, I don't really believe in these things, but I'm still worried they might do something neither to him, the boy or his gf.\nIs there anything I can do to protect the boy and his gf?

While two were sleeping in the back seat, the two in the front saw something very unusual, which they realized was a globe-shaped object (a luminous white sphere) that descended rapidly onto a hill or plain that was near an abandoned colonial house.\nThey stopped the vehicle on the side of the road because they realized that the phenomenon was strange. They quickly woke up the other two women, went out and quickly looked for what they saw, as the four approached, they saw an almost blinding glow, it was a white light that changed to red and then to green, it revolved around the UFO and illuminated the surroundings. Between the flashes, they managed to observe a human silhouette near the sphere - or inside the sphere in a later version.\nTwo others appeared, although the witnesses did not see where they came out, these characters described them as \"dressed in space suits, a diving suit with a visor and equipment similar to that of astronauts, with short boots and apparent gloves, all white.\"\nThe three beings were the same size as the witnesses (1.80 to 1.90). They moved with small steps or jumps near the sphere, holding their arms slightly away from their bust, they seemed interested in the ground and acted independently of each other and in a distant manner. For almost an hour, the UFO illuminated the hill even more, and a precise source emitted a rotating light that changed from white to red and then to green (like emergency lights) in which the object subsequently took off emitting a bright flash, leaving \"apparently\" the three occupants on the ground, lost from sight.\nThis case was reported 18 years later, in 1996.", "media": null, "score": 69, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comment_count": 6, "over_18": false}, "26": {"id": "1fuf8lz", "locked": false, "subreddit": "cryptids", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "truthisfictionyt", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1728097177.763479, "created_utc": 1727872928.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/q5uomvl99csd1.png", "title": "For Halloween, Here's a list of Cryptids That Have Killed ", "permalink": "/r/cryptids/comments/1fuf8lz/for_halloween_heres_a_list_of_cryptids_that_have/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 310, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comment_count": 62, "over_18": false}, "27": {"id": "1fvi0uo", "locked": false, "subreddit": "thetruthishere", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Nightshadepastry", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1728097177.91812, "created_utc": 1727988885.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1fvi0uo/did_i_hear_someone_screaming_for_help/", "title": "Did I hear someone screaming for help?", "permalink": "/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1fvi0uo/did_i_hear_someone_screaming_for_help/", "selftext": "After having lived in a small, single floor condo for a few years I began to hear sounds, usually in the early mornings that would often wake me up. I would hear knocking (often at the door of my room) thumps, bangs, slamming doors, loud crashes and even a young man's voice coming from somewhere else in the house. Not every day, but several times a week I would wake up to one or more of these.\nIn the early days I would usually come out of my room and ask my family wth is going on, who was knocking at my door, banging stuff around. I was really alarmed by the loud crashes and sometimes a voice coming from the other end of the house. No one else heard any of it, they had no idea what I was talking about. This place was 900sqft with three people living there. Many times I would come out and there would be no one there, nothing disturbed. The voice sounded like a young man a few years older than my son at the time (who was around 10), so I would often go to him and ask him what's up. It wasn't him, he was asleep or quiet in his room and heard nothing.\nThis became so frequent that I eventually stopped investigating the commotion. I'm sure you've all heard of hypnopompic hallucinations, I just accepted it and learned to live with the noise. I would often lie in bed and ask myself \"What are the chances I'm hearing something real? Probably low\" Then I'd just ignore it.\nOver a couple of years the noises escalated in frequency and \"volume\". It was definitely affecting my sleep as it happened almost every day at least once or twice. Then the screaming started. I was asleep, early morning, and suddenly it felt like someone stood next to the bed, put their mouth directly next to my ear and screamed at the top of their lungs. I jolted awake and took out my earplug. There was no one there, I was so scared and confused. My ear was ringing and painful! It was a male voice, maybe teen aged; a long drawn out word, it sounded like \"HELP\". This happened a few more times and it's when I started to take it a bit more seriously.\nI was really shaken by the sound of utter desperation and pain in that voice. It broke my heart to think \"what if there is a real person (ghost) screaming for help?\" I decided to do a little experiment. I operated under the assumption that this person was real and was asking for my help (for science). Over a couple of days I prayed earnestly for him. I prayed to angels, spirit guides, helpers; anyone who might be listening. I asked that he be helped, protected, guided home where he belongs etc. Immediately, everything stopped. Not one more knock or bump that I had become so accustomed to. I lived in that house for several more years and the noises never came back after that. It makes me wonder, if it was indeed a real ghost, why was I the only one to hear the sounds? And what the hell was he doing to make all that racket??", "media": null, "score": 29, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comment_count": 6, "over_18": false}, "28": {"id": "1ftg7by", "locked": false, "subreddit": "letsnotmeet", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Lighton876", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1728097178.1105475, "created_utc": 1727758704.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1ftg7by/weird_saleswoman_me_and_my_older_brother_met_in/", "title": "Weird saleswoman me and my older brother met in 1995", "permalink": "/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1ftg7by/weird_saleswoman_me_and_my_older_brother_met_in/", "selftext": "This story takes place when I was around 9 or 10 years old. There used to be this record store in walking distance from our house that me and my older brother used to go to often to buy our favorite music.

When she caught up to us she started following us and asking us questions about our favorite magazines. Since me and my brother weren't into magazines and knew about stranger danger we basically kept replying with \"I dont know.\" Eventually she pulls out this bag that she was carrying with her and pulls out some adult magazines and tries to sell them to us. (Can't remember the price.) Me and my brother were both clearly minors so her trying to sell explicit magazines to us was weirded out my brother. I was young so I didn't understand it at the time.\nAt this point she starts getting sort of aggressive and insists that we buy her dumb magazines. When my brother grabs my arm so we can keep walking she decides to grab me buy the shirt and hold on to me so I dont go anywhere. I scream as loud as I could and that made her let go. Once she let go me and my brother ran all the way home. We didn't tell our parents in fear that we might not be able to go back ever again if we did so.  We went back to that same record store for a couple more years but we never saw that woman again.

We watched Gone Girl and the movie ended close to midnight so it was late as we were leaving. \nI was the one driving so we left the theaters and I hopped on the freeway to get home. As I got on the freeway I was in the right lane and stuck behind a semi so I put on my blinker to pass them on the left, it was late and I didn\u2019t see a car in sight besides the semi so I got over to pass them. Not even a minute later a white truck was behind me flashing his brights and getting really close to my rear bumper so my first thought is \u201ccrap, did I accidentally cut them off?\u201d Didn\u2019t seem likely as I checked my mirrors and didn\u2019t see anyone behind me on the freeway at all. I got up past the semi and moved over to the right again thinking well if I\u2019d been a dick and cut this dude off he can flip me off and be on his way. But no. \nAs soon as there was enough of a gap he filled the tiny space between me and the semi and was on my bumper again. My ex had fallen asleep and I didn\u2019t want to wake him yet as this could be just some guy pissed off and maybe I made a mistake and didn\u2019t see him. Granted there were three whole empty lanes to the left of us he could have passed me  miles ago. He\u2019s still flashing his brights and tailing me so I get over hoping he\u2019ll just have established his dominance and moved on. He follows me in every lane I change to. I stop using my blinker when changing lanes and he still just swerves to be right behind me. At this point I am scared he\u2019s going to hit my bumper and I pump it up to 90 and he follows  suit. I\u2019m shaking and finally nudge my ex with my elbow and say \u201cbabe I think we\u2019re being followed.\u201d He wakes up and looks behind us and I change lanes and he sees what I mean. My exit to get home isn\u2019t for another few miles and I\u2019m trying to get my ex to call the police because I know at this point this guy isn\u2019t letting up. He doesn\u2019t call he\u2019s just watching. \nI finally get a hold of my nerves and realize there\u2019s an exit to another freeway coming up. I\u2019m in the lane second from right and as soon as I see the exit I swerve as fast as I can to get on the freeway exit barely missing the concrete pillar to the bridge above it. I only look over to the truck for a second but I can see him looking straight at us. \nI\u2019m sobbing at this point and my ex just looks at me and I know he saw him looking at us too. I pull off the first exit and find the first well lit gas station I can because I am in no shape to drive anymore. My ex lets me sob for a bit and we switch so he can finish the drive home. Once we get home and I\u2019m a little calmer we start talking about it and I explain what happened while he was asleep and we get to the point where we\u2019re talking about pulling off and him looking at us and how fucking freaky that was. He kind of looks at me confused and then is just quiet and he goes \u201cbabe, he had a gun pointed at us.\u201d I have no fucking idea what this guy had in mind for us that night, the drive ins were uneventful and we hadn\u2019t pissed anyone off or even talked to anyone so I don\u2019t think he followed us from there.

Side note, if you\u2019ve never been out to Tombstone or Bisbee, I highly recommend you add those spots on your places to visit. \nPicture was taken with an iPhone 14 Pro Max. I had my flash off and had my exposure set to max to get in good night shots. The photo was taken when someone else was using flash photography which is why everything has a grey tint. I am just now posting the picture because I wanted to receive my copyright certificate before sharing it with the World.\nDuring the tour, there is a portion where you sit in the main hall area in the dark with your guide. There are various sensors placed around the room such as K2 meters, a rempod (in the picture), spirit box, and a doll with an integrated K2 meters.\nI took this picture right when the rempod started going off next to our guide. I took this as someone else was taking a picture using flash photography which made everything grayish, but you can still see the red light from the rempod lighting up the area. I have also added a picture of what the view looks like with the lights turned on so you can see that there is nothing in the framed picture which could be confused for the face. There were no other individuals in our group who looked like the man in the picture (I did take a video of everyone in the group out of habit, it helps to exclude).

I ran up our curved staircase, and turned right immediately through the doorway of my parents room. as i entered and stood to face my parents bed, the tablet directly across the room from the foot of their bed, i saw her.\ni stood completely in shock. the pitch black silhouette of a young girl in a puffy dress was sitting on the foot of my parents bed, staring straight forward at the wall ahead of her. i didn\u2019t know what to do, but i felt paralyzed. as i watched her, she ever so slowly turned her head to look at me with these saucer like white eyes. just an absence of black on her face where instead was white, those were her eyes. i slowly leaned out of my parents doorway after a couple seconds of eye contact and yelled downstairs.\n\u201cDad!\u2026DAAAAAAD!!\u2026\u201d\nbut nothing back. and so as i peaked back into the room, she was gone. just gone. i was afraid and so i stepped carefully, but still retrieved the tablet and scurried downstairs as if something were nipping at my ankles.\nPembina is a small town now, it was even smaller when i was young. in our house (which we called \u201cthe little house\u201d or \u201cthe pembina house,\u201d there was a (very creepy) basement, a main floor, and a second floor. my brother and i shared a room on the second floor, as did my sisters, and my parents slept in a room on the main floor.\nThe second Encounter:\ni don\u2019t remember the context for why i was going to my room or anything or how far apart this was from the first encounter, but i rounded a corner to enter the stairwell and, i remember distinctly, i was looking at my feet on the first two steps. i looked up the stairs and froze as i saw her at the top of the stairs, again just staring at me.\ni-\u2026i don\u2019t know what had gotten into me at this time, but i was annoyed enough at this thing for showing up that i went up the stairs at a full sprint to try and catch her. i watched her as her whole body just turned, without lifting her legs, and walked so slowly around the corner and up the stairs which led to the second floor just past the corner.\ni made it to the top and, surprise surprise, she was nowhere. i looked in every room upstairs, and nothing. disappeared again.\nThe Last Encounter: this happened at our pembina house. i was a very outdoorsy kid and loved catching bugs and collecting rocks and building forts and everything, it was awesome. in our backyard, i had caught a butterfly with a glass from our kitchen, and decided that the best place to store it was in my sisters closet. under a glass. with a single branch..\nmy logic was that it would (a) be safe, and (2) not be found and stolen by anyone since my sisters didn\u2019t use their closet.\ni slid a paper under the glass to seal the butterfly in, and i remember that the paper had a drawing i had done of the iron robot from that animated kids movie of the same name. very crudely drawn, but i remember that fun detail.\nanyways,\nthe next day, i went back. up the stairs to the second floor, into my sisters closet, and, to my surprise, discovered a very dead butterfly. i was very sad and looked out my sisters window at that moment and immediately caught her gaze. she was standing, far out in our yard, very far, but she was looking up at me through the window. i put down the butterfly and slowly walked to the window, not breaking eye contact. after about a minute of her staring, she once again turned without moving her legs and almost floated off to the side, out of view behind a hedge.\nTo this day, i have no explanation further than her being a shadow person, and i was first introduced to that revelation in the sixth grade when i was reading a \u201chaunted canada\u201d book which had a story detailing a shadow person.\ni hope people don\u2019t think im just making things up, as i tried to include every detail i could remember. To this day, im still scared she\u2019s watching sometimes, but it\u2019s just paranoia im sure, since i haven\u2019t seen her since then.\nanyways, if people liked this, i actually have a LOT more ghost encounters that my whole family has experienced after my parents divorce, which i would be happy to share.\nhave a great day, and thank you for reading!

Well it did all the pipes would disconnect at night, the floor boards would creek at night, the windows/doors would open when they were locked.

I remember it telling me to stay in bed but I was like fuck that lmao and ran like a bitch outta there crying my eyes out into my mum and dads room, as I got older they would tell me they knew it was haunted apparently by a young victorian boy but they didn't really believe it until I said what I saw, my mum and dad are quite resiliant? and not fussed by the paranormal and things went on as normal becuase we lived where we would generat income. I dont know how long after this but the electrics tripped (was 04-06? we didn't have fuses then) and a fire broke out during the night and the firefighter said to my mother I was 2 minutes from dying so take it as you will.

I never believed it as I go for night drives occasionally and never saw him or anything resembling a man that lives in the woods. \nAnyway, tonight I decided to go for a drive and drove past a pizza place, being hungry I decided to get a pizza before I went home. In my head I had a plan to eat pizza and play some Minecraft as I\u2019m in my 2 week Minecraft phase at the moment. \nI paid for my pizza and started walking to my car with the pizza in one hand and my phone in the other messaging my friend if he wants to play some Minecraft when I get home. I look up from my phone to cross the road to the car park and I see something under my car. It looks like a shadow or something dark.\nI put my phone in my pocket and pull out my keys. I unlock the car to scare off anything close to the car, I was thinking it may be a car or a dog just hanging around my car, but when I unlock the car nothing happens. No cat running away and nobody running away. \nThe shadow looked like it was cast from the drivers side so I was gonna have to look at what it was whether I wanted to or not to get in. I put my keys away and pull out my phone again and turn the flash light on to see better in the dark. \nAs I turn towards the driver side of my car I see him. A dirty naked guy with big eyes staring right at me. He was crouched down trying to hide from me. \nNow I don\u2019t usually get scared of anything. But this guy scared me. He looked like he rolled around in mud and it dried out on his skin, his eyes looked creepy, bloodshot and kind of bulging out of his head. And he was naked. \nI get startled and jump backwards out of instinct dropping my pizza in the process. It falls out of its box and onto the floor. I start moving back slowly and shout at him to get away from my car. \nHe looks up at me, then at the pizza, then back at me again. He tilts his head to one side and then jumps towards the pizza, like a dog, grabs it and starts running away down the road and I assume he ran all the way to the woods, I wouldn\u2019t know where he went as I didn\u2019t feel like following him.\nI lock my car and run back to the pizza place and stay there for a bit. The workers obviously don\u2019t believe me when I tell them what happened but I know what I saw. \nOnce the fear subsides after a while, I realise that this guy just stole my pizza. Angry as I was looking forward to it I decide to get another one and run to my car this time. I get in put the pizza on the passenger seat and go home. \nOnce I got home I locked all my doors and windows. I even locked my bedroom door as I feel a little scared still. I think I\u2019ll be playing Minecraft until the sun comes up. \nCreepy dirty naked guy that lives in the woods close to my town I never wanna see you again because I may have to fight you for stealing my pizza.

This is my first post here and something strange happened tonight and I can\u2019t really tell what I saw. \nI was driving back from my parents house, a couple hours ago. (Around 10 pm on my local time zone) I\u2019m from S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. And as I was driving, I saw something on the lane to my right, something that I can describe as a Streaks of White Lights. It went so fast. I thought for a millisecond that could be a Cyclist. But it\u2019s impossible to be a Cyclist (person). This highway is one of the fastest highways in the country. Where the speed limit is 120 km/h (74 mph). But on Sunday night, where the road is clear. Drivers don\u2019t go less then 130-140km/h (80-86mph). I was around 80mph. The lack of lights would get this cyclist killed in less than a minute. It\u2019s a stretch that\u2019s almost entering the city but it\u2019s still a rural area. \nSo It had a Shape of Humanoid kind of it but it was just lights. White shining lights. I wasn\u2019t alone in the car. My girlfriend was with me on the passenger seat. But she was on the phone I asked and she saw nothing. \nI already had multiple encounters with the supernatural in my life, wasn\u2019t the first time. But I got very curious of what it might be that I saw on that road. \nI found the picture online. I know it\u2019s not the best way to describe it. But by the pattern of lights / streaks it can give you guys an idea!

One evening, my father was at home with his elder sister (my aunt), along with my grandparents (my father\u2019s mother and father). My aunt was casually walking on the roof of our house. Behind our home, there was a small alley-like area.\nWhile walking, my aunt absentmindedly spit down from the roof and then came back inside. Everything seemed normal. Later, everyone gathered for dinner, and the night went on without any issues.\nHowever, as the night progressed, my aunt began feeling strange. Her body started heating up, and she became restless, almost as if she had lost control over herself. Suddenly, she began speaking in a heavy voice, saying, \u201cWhy did you spit on me? I will kill you!\u201d She kept repeating this in a voice that didn't sound like hers.\nHer body became stiff, and my father, along with my grandparents, tried to hold her down. It felt as if something had taken control of her body. It seemed that where she had spit earlier, something or someone was present, and it had been angered by her action.\nFor some time, my aunt continued speaking in that strange voice. My grandparents, realizing something was very wrong, began apologizing to the unknown entity that seemed to have possessed her. They begged for forgiveness, saying they didn\u2019t know it was there or meant any harm.\nAfter some time, things returned to normal, and my aunt was herself again.\nToday, my aunt is no longer with us, but this story was passed down to me by my father, who was quite young at the time.

It was the middle of winter, and the night was unseasonably warm, without a hint snow on the ground. I left my apartment around 8 PM to go for my daily walk (I worked nights and my schedule was screwed up, hence the 8 PM walk), figuring I would cross the bridge into the city nearby. For further context I'm a tall guy who's fairly athletic, and I was in my late 20's at the time. I'd rarely had a problem walking at night, and at the time, I felt safe to do so. I put on my headphones and headed towards the bridge.\nThe first twenty minutes were uneventful. I passed by old houses, a subpar Mexican restaurant, a really good Mexican restaurant, a sketchy gas station, some newly built upscale apartments, and finally, I was at the river, enjoying the view of the bright lights over the dark flowing water, not yet frozen. I crossed the bridge into the city and hit a crosswalk button at a four way intersection, then noticed someone standing on the corner opposite, the only other soul I'd seen outside that night. Seemingly she was doing nothing, and I assumed she was waiting for an uber to come pick her up, since she didn't seem to be waiting for the light to change.\nThe street, ordinarily busy during the daytime, was silent. The light changed, and I crossed, headed in her direction. As I neared her I noticed that she would cast glances in my direction, then look away, almost sheepishly. She did this multiple times, and I figured she was unnerved by me. I sympathized, figuring it must have made her uneasy, us being the only two people on a dimly lit street. As I passed by, I took in her outfit, mostly because I thought she looked cold: she wore a knitted hat with tassels, a sweater that looked too thin for the winter, tight jeans, and a little plastic children's backpack on her back. I thought she was in her teens at first, but upon closer inspection she appeared to be in her late twenties or thirties. She had short cropped light brown hair and a pale complexion. She was skinny and was of average height; I was maybe a head taller than her. I walked by and continued down the street.\nI passed by high rise hotels on my right and left, and made my way into a central park. During peak hours this place would be packed with tourists and locals alike, but that day, at an odd hour and with the pandemic in full swing, I felt like the only man in the city. I admired the brilliant display of lighted trees as I crossed through the center of the park; then, figuring I was at a good halfway point in my journey, I made my way around an old marble and stone library, back towards the bridge. As I turned the corner of the library back onto the street from which I'd come, I nearly collided with someone, moving towards me.\nIt was the same woman I'd seen not ten minutes earlier. My noise cancelling headphones were still on, so I pulled down one side and said something by way of apology. She said nothing in return. Instead, she stepped back from me and stood below a street light, not making eye contact. She stole tiny glances at me, that same tick I'd noticed before. I put my headphones back on, nodded a goodnight, and headed towards the nearest crosswalk.\nReason told me that she must be headed in the direction I'd come from, since we'd nearly run into each other headed opposite ways, but some part of me whispered that she wasn't headed that way. Sure enough, when I turned to look, she was trailing close behind me, her strides surprisingly long and energetic. I found this odd enough that I continued to watch her out of the corner of my eye.\nShortly after I reached the crosswalk, as I stood there waiting for the light to change, she caught up with me, passed me by, and stopped. A car when past, and as it did so, she squatted over her plastic bag a few meters from me, rifling frantically for something, looking up at me on occasion. I hit a button on my headphones, stopping my podcast, so that I could hear her better. What I found disturbing about the motion of her looking through her bag is that it struck me as fake, as though she were pretending for some reason. She was barely looking inside, and her careless motions struck more like bad acting. Something about her motions, the way she kept looking at me, felt wrong.\nThe light changed, and I began to walk quickly, but she was faster. She stood suddenly, darting past me towards the museum, swinging the half open little pink backpack over her shoulder. I watched her silhouette disappear into the darkness beyond the reach of the street lights. I hoped that that was the end of that, and after a few beats of not seeing her, I let my guard fall a little, restarting my podcast.\nBeyond the museum was a patch of poorly lit sidewalk, in front of a squat building with mirrorlike windows. I wasn't far from the bridge now. As I made my way back there, I turned my head to look at the reflections of buildings and streetlights in the windows. To my horror, a dark figure sprinted silently towards my reflection, dreamlike.\nI'm not sure why, maybe out of sheer confusion, but I turned to meet her as she hurtled towards me. Perhaps surprised by my sudden turn, she halted mere feet from me, staring. Her eyes were wide, and looked frantic, wild. She kept looking at my arms, then back at my face, as though sizing me up. My accidental bluff had worked, and in the darkness, I suppose I must have looked more prepared to fight back than I felt. She gripped something small tightly in one hand, though she held it off to the side, and in the shadow of the building I couldn't see what it was.\nSeconds dragged as we stood there, staring at one another. Immobilized by fear and confusion, I waited for her to make some move, to attempt to use whatever object she held in her hand.\nJust then, to my enormous relief, a car trundled slowly past. A bit of my strength returned, and over my blaring podcast I felt more than heard myself shouting at her, \"what do you want?\" No reply. I slowly backed away from her, expecting her to move. She just watched me, that same intense look on her face. I took another step back, then another, steadily backing away from her until I felt confident enough to turn and carefully walk away.\nAs I reached a better lit area, I began to move faster, all the while keeping my eyes trained on her shadowy form. She stood there for some time, statuesque. Then abruptly, having spontaneously abandoned whatever plan she may have had for me, she turned from me and without looking for traffic, she crossed the street with long strides, and disappeared around the corner of a building. Something about the casual air of it disturbed me.\nI kept my eyes trained behind me on my walk home, afraid that she would follow me. The bridge was well lit, and I saw no sign of her. Knowing that this was the only way for her to follow me and keep up on foot, I breathed a sigh of relief. I saw no more cars headed from the city, no more pedestrians out walking.\nNothing happened after that. I'm not sure why, but I didn't call the cops that night. I still regret having not called, despite my roommates insisting I do so. I just remembering thinking that I wasn't sure what to say to the cops, that I hadn't really been attacked, that they wouldn't be able to find her anyway. I made up excuses. I suppose I must have been in shock, in denial at having been nearly ambushed, especially by someone smaller than me, in my own city, so close to my apartment. One of my roommates called the cops for me. A cop drove through the area, but by that point, she was gone. \nWoman with the little pink backpack, let's not meet again.", "media": null, "score": 59, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comment_count": 8, "over_18": true}, "73": {"id": "1frqrn4", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ghosts", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Direct-Disaster2472", "link_flair_text": "Personal Encounter ", "time": 1728097206.1090775, "created_utc": 1727565250.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/1frqrn4/little_girl_dissapeared_right_in_front_of_me_and/", "title": "Little girl dissapeared right in front of me and im kinda trippin", "permalink": "/r/Ghosts/comments/1frqrn4/little_girl_dissapeared_right_in_front_of_me_and/", "selftext": "so im walking my dogs in my apt complex, and i see this little girl with a blue shirt, glasses, and a giraffe plushie just walking in the middle of the road. i didnt really know what to do or what was happening so i just looked around to see if there were any parents around, and therw were none. so she keeps walking to the this bend that would block my view, but she walks past this tree and boom. gone. i had assumed she had hid in a bush or behind a car, so i walk over there and nothing. am i tripping or did i see a ghost? ive never seen one before or experienced paranormal activity so im kinda at a loss. note: her clothing was modern another note: no drugs or inhibitors were involved", "media": null, "score": 70, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "comment_count": 38, "over_18": false}}}
