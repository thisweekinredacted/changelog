This is the same Vicki Polin who appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show on May 1, 1989, testifying under the pseudonym \"Rachel\" that she and her extended family in the Chicago area practiced satanic rituals, including infant sacrifices, in which she claimed to have participated (https://youtu.be/hwih4niZ4MA?si=gybEZL4S8VOUk2X7).\nFollowing her appearance, she founded The Awareness Center (https://theawarenesscenter.blogspot.com/2009/04/susan-rosenbluth-harassment-bulling.html), a rape and sexual violence prevention organization for Jewish communities. To date, there have been no formal accusations directly linking her public identity to the Oprah interview. However, in this Times of Israel article, Vicki Polin links herself to working for The Awareness Center (https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/metoo-except-if-youre-a-jew-antisemitism-in-the-anti-rape-movement/), strongly suggesting that she is indeed the same person.\nHersh's parents, Rachel and Jon Polin, have gained significant public attention since his abduction on October 7th. They have met with figures such as Pope Francis and Kamala Harris, spoken at the DNC in Chicago, and appeared on shows like Face the Nation and CBC. They have been interviewed multiple times by Anderson Cooper, who reportedly discovered the video of Hersh's abduction before its official release and showed it to his parents following an interview (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QqFweh3CC4).\nFurther independent investigations are needed to explore these connections and the 1989 allegations in Illinois, including the Chicago Jewish community\u2019s involvement in rebuilding Kibbutz Nir Oz (https://nypost.com/2023/12/09/news/kibbutz-nir-oz-is-rebuilding-after-the-oct-7-hamas-attack/).

I was told this story in 2012 and it has always stuck with me. Now that I have recently discovered this subreddit, I wanted to share this encounter with others.\nThe gentleman who imparted this story to me did so after a lengthy evening of enjoying beers at the fire pit in the backyard of his at-the-time Redding CA home. He recounted the time when he was a teenager living in a nearby town called Red Bluff. He had a girlfriend who lived within walking distance of his home and he used to sneak out and head to her house in the middle of the night. He recalled how the road he would walk to her place spanned a rural distance before reaching her neighborhood.\nOn one occasion he was making his way back home early in the morning after visiting his girlfriend. It was still very much nighttime as he was walking along the road. At this particular section, the road passed through the long dark section of rural span only to be momentarily lit by the infrequent passing of car headlights.\nIt was dark and quiet as he walked when he noticed the sound of what must have been footsteps following behind him. He was immediately made uncomfortable. It was not uncommon for drugged derelicts and transients to be wandering at this time of night in this area. These would be characters you would certainly not want anything to do with at this time of night, at this location.\nHe increased his pace yet the footsteps seemed to remain just as assuredly behind him as before. His discomfort began to elevate to panic. Suddenly a car was heading toward him on the desolate road. He knew as the headlights passed, he would have a chance to see who was following him.\nThe moment came and he turned to see what this crackhead wandering in the night might look like but what he saw was nothing of the sort.\n-HUMANOID-\nHe explained to me what he could only describe as what looked like a large Great Dane walking upright on its hind legs. I believe he did say it looked like the creature had a snout. He said the skin looked grey, pale and hairless and it was very skinny to the point where you could see its skeleton underneath. The most memorable detail he kept recalling though was the way in which its rib cage protruded just like that of a Great Dane.\nThe rest of the story is short. What he saw terrified him and he started sprinting and didn't stop until he reached the nearest lit area he could find, which was a random parking lot. He stood there terrified until the sun came up, walked the rest of the way home and never went down that road at night again.", "media": null, "score": 57, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comment_count": 13, "over_18": false}, "10": {"id": "1fnrlbo", "locked": false, "subreddit": "cryptids", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "Pain_Junkie_", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1727492387.1836302, "created_utc": 1727116047.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/62roxmmpqlqd1.jpeg", "title": "What are these?", "permalink": "/r/cryptids/comments/1fnrlbo/what_are_these/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 710, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comment_count": 163, "over_18": false}, "11": {"id": "1fmtqbt", "locked": false, "subreddit": "thetruthishere", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Anxiteyismynormal", "link_flair_text": "HELP!

I\u2019m into LARPing, and for those who don\u2019t know what it is, we basically spend the weekend in the woods dressed as medieval-fantasy characters and interact with each other. I go to these events with my friend and my partner, and we meet some more friends when we\u2019re there.\nThere are all types of people at these events, but 99.9% are absolute angels. I had yet to meet the .1%, but wish I hadn\u2019t. \nBefore the event started, a guy, we\u2019ll call him Greg, swung by my tent while I was setting it up. My partner and friend were setting up the secondary tent up a path, and couldn\u2019t see me. There were 5 other people to my right. I had never met the guy before, but as soon as he said hi, I had a bad feeling. He was around 5\u201910, obese, a neckbeard, basically what would fit the description of an Incel. \nHe approaches me and asks me if I\u2019m here alone. I say no, I\u2019m here with people, but don\u2019t mention my partner or friend directly. He asks me if I\u2019m a gamer, to which I say yes. From then on, he starts rambling on Ark Survival, which is a game I personally have 3000+ hours on. He tells me blatantly wrong info, misnames the dinos, tells me stuff that\u2019s impossible to do in the game, even with mods, etc. And every time I correct him, I can see he looks to be getting even more annoyed. \nI end the conversation, saying I have to go back to setting up the tent, and he leaves. Fast forward to around 10-11pm, the event has started, which means any mention of the \u00ab\u00a0real world\u00a0\u00bb such as cars, tv, pop culture, etc, is forbidden by a rule called Decorum. We\u2019re playing a campfire game with my friends and my partner, and the guy comes by to sit with us. He sits next to me, I move over. He scoots closer, I move over, he scoots. Eventually I get up and sit next to my friend. As we play the game, he keeps referring to the real world, and to video games, so we tell him either to leave or to make an effort and speak properly. He leaves. \nThe next day, I go up a trail for fake hunting(gathering ressources). As I come back down towards the village, in the middle of the woods with no camps I can hide in, he\u2019s there waiting for me on the trail. He then asks me if I would like to go get a coffee or something sometimes, to which I answer no thanks. \nAs we go down the trail, I tell him I have to collect plants for my potions, so if he can excuse me, I\u2019ll be going back to the village to leave my bow and collect my basket. I am walking fast. He follows me, grabs my arm and tells me \u00ab\u00a0I could come with you\u2026 You, me, alone in the woods looking for plants, that looks like the perfect scenario\u00a0\u00bb. I freak out and walk very fast down the trail to the village. \nMy neighbors see me and look very concerned. They ask if I need help, I tell them \u00ab\u00a0in an honesty\u00a0\u00bb which is a code to say take me seriously this isn\u2019t part of the game, that this dude is being extra creepy and following me. \nThey take their weapons(foam weapons) and tell him to fuck off before they carve him a new asshole. I stay with them for a few minutes before chilling with my friends. \nNight comes, we\u2019re having fun, stuff is happening in terms of fighting and encounters. Then at around midnight, I decide to go to the bathroom. At that point I haven\u2019t seen the guy since around 7pm. As I come back from the bathroom, in complete darkness, this guy jumps from a bush and pins me against a tree. \nHe tells me he\u2019s not proud of me, that I\u2019ve been leading him on, that he doesn\u2019t understand why I would hold another guy\u2019s hand and hug three other guys but not him. I tell him I hold my fianc\u00e9\u2019s hand and I do hug my friends, but he\u2019s neither. I also tell him to stop his bs \u00ab\u00a0in all honesty\u00a0\u00bb, to which he answer \u00ab\u00a0but what if in all honesty I just want a little kiss, huh? Just a little kiss and then you can go\u00a0\u00bb. \nI yell NO, and try to hit him to get away. My friends, who were right on the other side of the bridge separating us, heard me scream. They took their weapons, called upon my neighbors, and around 10 people came careening down the bridge to help. \nThe guy let me go and turned to my rescuers, saying he was just interrogating me for informations concerning the demons(our foes). My friends, who have seen the guy be an asshole before, tell him not to move, that they\u2019re going to get the owner of the LARP to deal with him. He tried to dissuade them, but my neighbors tell him to sit down or he\u2019ll be visiting Death\u2019s Altar before he can move. \nI\u2019m taken away by my fianc\u00e9 who is very worried and concerned about what happened. The owner comes, I explain what happened, and he takes Greg outside the play to discuss.

This happened on August 27th, 2024 in the state of Oklahoma in the US.\n(Was told to add this to a few other threads from my original post, so here we go!)\nSo, some context, I live in a rural area that is currently being made into a big town. New stores, new neighborhoods, the whole nine. Its still in the early days so its all in construction, so my neighborhood still has woodlands on one side and just open land for a few miles on another. Since the first night I've come out here I've always felt like im being watched if im outside. Sometimes its not as direct, as if its acknowledging my presence but I'm not its priority, if that makes sense. But other times it felt I was the only thing it was looking at. Especially at night. And I've done the dumb things as challenging it by walking further out into my tree scattered yard, blocking the moonlight in places. Although some of those times were on purpose, i had to feel comfortable walking into my own backyard. So each time i did, i stayed longer, and further out until i finally got freaked out and went back inside. The entire time i state my intent, wether im just going to retrieve something or simply saying I'm only walking because this is my backyard, but that i mean no disrespect. I even began to say that I respected its presence and i dont mind it staying, but i dont appreciate it trying to make me feel scared in my own home. While i acknowledge this was its home first, my situation was not one of choice of me living here specifically. I made this known every time i felt its presence prioritize me. \nThis has been happening for a while now. But its threatening/protective presence began to fade and it was more of a curiosity. At least it felt that eay to me, i may be misinterpreting it, but the threat and fear presence started to go away. And while it started out happening only at night, i began to feel it around me during the day. When this started happening i started finding feathers on the ground. While yes i live where a lot of birds are, i haven't found any in the time I've been living here until this happened. Each time i was genuinely ecstatic to find one. It started out with just one or two a day, and then increased to about 10 a day. I have a full jar full of feathers now. It was blue jays mostly for a while, and then others started appearing. I literally turned around and an owl feather was floating in the air in front of me. I just stared at it while it landed soflty on the ground. This was my absolute favorite one to find so far. Even trunping the raven and juvenile hawk feather i have. After finding the one owl feather, i found about 5 smaller tuffs of owl feathers the next day. This continued happening for a few months with the bluejay feathers. And as its begun to trun colder, there are less birds. \nOne day, a couple weeks after the owl feathers, i was taking my dogs outside and was just walking through the yard, talking to my dogs, as any slightly sane person does, and i felt its presence again. I smiled, because at this point its become familiar and I enjoy it. Well out of the corner of my eye something moves. While i have always felt its presence, i have never had such a physical reaction as i did when i turned to watch this figure step out behind a tree on the opposite end of the yard than me. I feel the goosebumps form on my arm as if ice had just been brushed across them. Every single hair on my arms, neck, back of my head stood. I stared had trouble understanding what i was seeing for a second. \nAcross the yard stood s figure with furs drapped acreos them, and hide clothes, they had bones and sticks tied in places, and on their head sat a skull with the biggest antlers I've ever seen. They're eyes laid behind the sockets, as if wearing it as a mask. It locked eyes with me, nodded and took a step and disappeared. Two of my dogs were barking st something across the stree while my 3rd, who is very independent and doesn't like to cuddle, watched this thing, and stepped closer to me. So i know i saw it, because my dog acknowledged it. But its still throwing me for a loop.\nEdit:   as I answer or reply to comments I've realized more has happened than i thought. After the night of seeing said entity, i would hear coyotes every time i went outside for about a week straight. But one night definitely stood out. My partner had come home late from work, and we did our usual routine of, make food, and then step out for a smoke and let the dogs out. Well we did this, but this time we kept the dogs on a leash, we normally don't but for some reason we did, I don't remember why now. It was quiet while we walked the dogs, let them do their business, and as usual i felt eyes on me. Now at this point I'm somewhat used to it so i acknowledge it and say I'm just letting my dog go to the bathroom and I'll go back to my porch. But when i said this, the feeling of getting to the porch got urgent. Which hasn't happened in months. This confused me and i tried to shake it off and repeat what i said but then something fell around the trees on the opposite side of the yard. Of course me and my dog looked up and over. Immediately there was this little whisper of a thought that said \"Porch.\" And so we made our way back. More things kept snapping or falling but it didn't feel as dangerous anymore. We waited a bit and it stopped and we finally relaxed. My partner and i stood while we talked, just enjoying the stars when the coyotes started going. Usually they're like a mile away but this sounded just on the other side of the fence. Now i know they weren't right there but that's how loud it was. They've never been this close before. They sounded angry too, like they had something surrounded. I had a sense of worry, but also just in awe at the sounds of nature. I felt bad for whatever poor creature they had, but there was something beautiful about nature still happening as construction takes place around it. \nAfter it got silent there was a bird call, it was far away and I dont have the best hearing so i couldn't tell what it was. But it stuck in the back of my mind as we talked. After a moment it happened again, but this time i could make out the deeper tones in it. A few more moments and i knew it, it was an owl. And at this point i realize it's getting closer. Now I've heard it before, and obviously i have owl feathers, but i never heard when its near. We stopped talking and just listened as it went from tree to tree, closer into our yard until it was on the edge of the closest one. I listened to it for what seemed like forever but it was about 10-15 mins? It just sat there, calling out every now and then. Things began to snap on the other side of the yard and my dog began to growl. I kept her calm but her fur bristled. The owl called out again before diving at something and then taking off. After this we absolutely went inside haha. \nAnother thing I've noticed, like I've stated in a comment, was that since coming here, animals of all kinds seem to find me or be near me when they take their last breaths. It first happened with a snake. My dog found it, didn't touch it. I picked it up seeing it had an injury and went to look at it, it moved a little and then stopped breathing. I teared up and took it to our fire pit as we were going to have a bonfire soon. I wanted to give it a little moment ya know? After this incident, it started happening with spiders, and a lizard, and then recently a moth with a deformed wing. I brought the moth inside, gave it a slice of apple and let it eat off of it and set it on a log with some moss inside. I checked back later and it had passed. This doesn't happen often but often enough I've noticed it.

I had a noise machine to help me sleep. I had it going and for some reason felt this intense feeling of dread and terror like nothing I've felt before. I'm talking pit in stomach, heart starts going crazy, adrenaline. I thought at the time I was having sleep paralysis because I've had a few experiences before with sleep paralysis but I could move my body so that rules it out. My eyes were closed tight because I didn't want to risk seeing whatever was making me feel this scared but eventually I gave in and opened my eyes. Right at the foot of my bed there was this torso. No legs, no head, no arms, just torso. Just floating in the air. It kinda sounds funny tbh thinking back on it but I was absolutely terrified. I was calling for my mom but she couldn't hear me over my noise machine. I felt for some reason it was mocking me, like I was trying to call for help but my mom couldn't hear me because of the noise machine and I was just stuck. I couldn't move either out of fear. I still don't think it was sleep paralysis because I could feel the difference between just not being able to move and not being able to move out of fear. My closet was open, very stupidly, and I don't know if this was me just imagining things but I swear I could see this shriveled, creepy face peering out of my clothes at me, this long spindly hand peering out from my clothes as well holding it open a little. Looking up there was some sort of thing looking down at me. I can't remember it for some reason I just know it was watching me. It flickers between being this flat thing against the ceiling and some sort of small humanoid. My mom eventually heard me because at this point I was screaming for her to open the door. As soon as the light hit my room everything just disappeared. I told her what happened and she was concerned but at the same time was like \"Just go back to sleep\". The weird thing was that usually I can chock it up to it being some item or pile of clothes that is shaped like something else and in the dark your mind will play tricks on you and makes it look like something else. But the thing was there was nothing that could've been the torso. It was floating, no poster where it was. Nothing. The closet thing didn't make sense because I could see my clothes moving. The ceiling thing didn't make sense either cause there was nothing on my ceiling besides a fan. It could've been the fan but where the thing was, wasn't near the fan.

It was just me living there in a quaint and spacious townhouse with my then, 4 year daughter. We were relatively new to the area and didn\u2019t know many people but did become familiar with the kind older gentleman who lived next door. His name (for the purpose of this story) was Ben. \nWe lived in a connected townhouse with our two units abutting each other. Our street was lined with beautiful floral trees and was quite nice but Providence is weird in that the conditions of the houses and little neighborhoods can vary drastically street by street. We were near a few rough neighborhoods but I felt relatively safe in my new home. \nI remember a few nights prior to this specific night, I saw a Facebook post with a safety tip to put your car keys next to your bedside so if anything ever happens, you can press the alarm and scare an intruder off. I\u2019ve never been overly concerned about my safety and rarely took advantage of any tips I saw on Facebook so I\u2019m not sure how or why I suddenly decided to heed this advice.  \nI was reading a book in bed with my light on in my second floor bedroom hours after putting my daughter to sleep, when I heard a loud sound outside. I peered out the window to take a look and saw nothing. I had taken some melatonin that evening, turned off the light and went to sleep. \nIt was maybe a half hour later or so, when I was suddenly woken up by what felt like almost an earthquake! The room shook and I heard a loud thud. Half awake, I gasped and sat up wondering if it was my imagination or if I actually felt something and immediately ran to my daughter\u2019s room thinking she had fallen off her bed or injured herself or something. As I swung her door wide open, there she was\u2026 sleeping soundly and sweetly. I was so confused.\nI heard another loud bang and had this an eerie feeling that something was wrong but I couldn\u2019t figure out what. I grabbed my car key fob and took it downstairs as I nervously inspected the first floor. I swore to myself if I heard one more sound, I would press the alarm just in case but I didn\u2019t\u2026 it was silent after that. I returned to bed and took a while to fall asleep again but soon shut my eyes.\nThe next day went on like any other day when I noticed a friend of mine had repeatedly called me in the afternoon. I picked up my daughter from preschool and called the friend back. \n\u201cDid you hear?\u201d He said.\n\u201cNo, what?\u201d I answered.\n\u201cNews outlets were mobbing your street about an hour ago and the news trucks were even in your driveway!\u201d\nI sat silent, confused. \n\u201cThree men broke into your neighbor\u2019s place last night, tied him up at gunpoint and stole thousands of dollars worth of items, and took off with his car.\u201d\nI immediately fell to my knees and began sobbing. I had HEARD it all happen. I ALMOST pressed the button. I almost but I DIDN\u2019T. \nI sobbed and felt completely unsafe. I asked a friend to come over for the night to stay with us and it wasn\u2019t until the next day I got the chance to speak to Ben.\nBen explained the whole story and told me the cops wanted to talk to me so I could share what I had heard and experienced. He said the men smashed the window in his basement and entered through there (that\u2019s the sound I heard before going to bed). Apparently the timeline suggested that they saw my light and me peering out the window and waited 30 minutes or so until my light was out to enter the premises. They didn\u2019t realize he was home and since he had gone to bed early that night, it was suggested that they cased his place beforehand. He had been asleep when one of them was rummaging through his stuff upstairs in his bedroom which was directly on the other side of my closets through a shared wall. The sounds and shakes I heard and felt were apparently the intruder knocking him down to the ground after realizing Ben was there and cupping his mouth to tell him if he made another sound, he would kill him. This is why I never heard another sound as I was investigating thereafter. After they tied him up, he remained tied up for over 12 hours and eventually broke free before calling the police. \nI cried again and apologized profusely to Ben and explained what I had heard and he simply said that as he was tied up, all he could think about was that he was glad it didn\u2019t happen to me and my little girl.  I really don\u2019t know what I would have done if my daughter and I had to experience that level of trauma firsthand. Ben seemed to be ok considering it all but it took me so long to feel safe again and for the guilt to subside. They never caught the guys and I ended up ordering a taser (which was illegal) and some mace and even for the first time in my life, considered getting a gun but I decided against it.  I have been fortunate to never experience anything close to that again and certainly don\u2019t want to. I\u2019m glad Ben was ultimately ok but next time I\u2019ll listen to my instinct. It\u2019s better to be safe than be sorry.

I thought it was normal at first. He brought small gifts. Then I said some things that might have upset him. he started stalking me, showing up outside my house and at places I posted on my instagram story. I called the police, they couldn't do anything since he hadn't broken any laws. I didn't tell my parents for fear they'd overreact. Eventually, he kind of just went away. I think it's because he gave up but I honestly have no idea what he's doing now.\nThis happened like 6-7 years ago now. Feel free to ask any questions. Your questions might help me jog my memory and I'll remember more details.\nI played soccer for one year in community college after high school. I knew this guy because he worked for the athletics department. He was another student.\nTuesdays and Thursdays, I had a one-hour gap between classes. This guy noticed me in the library, asked what I was doing there, I told him I had an hour-long gap, and he started coming regularly to hang out.\nI didn't mind because he seemed like a normal guy. He wasn't waiting for anything but he just wanted to hang out. He brought me little gifts a few times, like chocolate and stuff. He was being a little too sweet for someone I barely knew. I didn't think about red flags.\nWith the gifts, I remember he always downplayed it. He'd be like \"they had extra kitkat bars today in the office. do you want some?\" He never said that he purposely bought kitkat for me. I know a lot more about boys now than I knew back then. I think he knew that that buying me gifts would be too much, but he still wanted to do it without doing it.\nThe soccer season for us ended before Thanksgiving. The only teams that kept playing after that were going to the playoffs (not us). After thanksgiving, we had finals.\nIn that brief period after the soccer season and before thanksgiving, he asked me about my classes for second semester. Tbh I hadn't been super organized with course registration and I honestly didn't know (also the counselors were completely clueless). I didn't tell him that but I remember saying I didn't want to have another gap hour like this because it wasted so much time. I don't think he was happy to hear that.\nHe also asked if I would play another season and I said no to that. I needed to manage my time better and playing soccer everyday was not helping. I think my mistake was that I just said too much and unfiltered. I used to do that a lot back then, saying too much without thinking about how it can affect other people's feelings.\nThat was on the last thursday before thanksgiving. So no more hour-gaps to hang out anymore. We had thanksgiving break, we took finals, and we had winter break. Everything was great.\nWinter break was when the real problems started. In the mornings, this guy literally showed up outside my house while sitting in his car. The first time I didn't believe it was actually him. The second time, I checked and it was. By then, it was really clear that we both knew what was going on. He was stalking me.\nAnd that wasn't all.\nI posted on my instagram story sometimes about places I was. This guy literally showed up there several times, like girly stores at the mall where he had zero business being. He did lots of things like that. He also started pointing his phone at me like he was taking pictures. That was even weirder.\nI basically stopped using social media over this.\nAfter winter break this continued. When my parents were at work, this guy came during the afternoon too. I called the cops a few times. They went and tried to talk to him, he basically told them he wasn't going to talk, and that was it. I think the cops wanted to help but they could never do anything about it because he was careful not to break the law, like he didn't trespass, he didn't make threats, he didn't show weapons, etc.\nI have no idea what he's doing now. My guess is that he gave up. Maybe his little obsession kind of became old and he found other things to pay more attention to. At least I hope so. But if he still comes by, I have no idea.\nI think the most challenging thing is that I couldn't tell my parents since I knew they would completely freak out.", "media": null, "score": 132, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comment_count": 17, "over_18": true}, "45": {"id": "1fmzrfl", "locked": false, "subreddit": "truecreepy", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Time-Training-9404", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1727492418.7635283, "created_utc": 1727029086.0, "url": "https://historicflix.com/the-haiku-stairs-mystery-what-happened-to-daylenn-pua/", "title": "In 2015, Daylenn Pua disappeared while hiking the Haiku Stairs, also known as the \"Stairway to Heaven.\" One of his last photographs appears to show a man in the far background.

This discovery, if confirmed, could reshape our understanding of our place in the universe.\nThe James Webb Space Telescope has detected dimethyl sulfide (DMS) in K2-18b's atmosphere - a compound exclusively produced by biological processes on Earth. This finding has sent shockwaves through the scientific community, with some researchers speculating that we may be on the brink of confirming alien life.\nInterestingly, NASA has remained unusually tight-lipped about these findings. This silence has fueled speculation among some observers that the agency may be withholding information from the public. Are they verifying the data, or is there more to this story than meets the eye?\nProfessor Madhusudhan, visibly affected by the gravity of the potential discovery, described sleepless nights as the evidence mounted. \"If this is when it's finally going to come through, it's a momentous occasion,\" he stated, hinting at the profound implications of the find.\nAs the scientific community eagerly awaits further confirmation, questions linger. Why the delay in official announcements? What might be the consequences of confirming extraterrestrial life? And perhaps most intriguingly, if life exists on K2-18b, how advanced might it be?\nThis potential discovery not only challenges our perception of life in the universe but also raises questions about the transparency of space agencies and the potential impact of such knowledge on global affairs.

I wasn't tired, more so just forcing myself. When i was kid i would sleep with covers over my head for comfort but as an adult i've kind of stopped this. Anyway this particular night i had the covers over my head for 15 mins to try to sleep but was still wide awake. After about 15 mins, i had this feeling like something was behind me. It wasn't physical, it was a mental intuition. I take the cover off, turn my head and boom! Maybe like 6 inches away from my face, this blueish translucent figure is creeping over me, its head near my head. It has 6 white eyes no pupils, and head shape was not normal, I cant remember what is was though. After about 1.5 sec of me staring at it in a WTF stare it shapeshifts into - me?! or what i think looked like me but bald and still blueish transparent. I told my girlfriend the other day it looked like the silver surfer. I get up, as soon as i start movement this thing shifts toward my hallway, so i start running after it, it looks behind it while it runs and boom! The figure vanishes or disperses through the door! I had never seen anything like it and after that experience, something weird did happen that was similar but not like that.\nKeep in mind i was not scared at all, but i was intrigued and wanted to know why it was here and i've never seen anything like this or believe in ghosts. I do believe aliens or entities that defy laws of the universe exist, and ive always been fascinated with space, ufo, aliens, disbanded military projects, etc. as a kid and would read a ton of books about it. Also want to say i was fully awake and I KNOW WHAT I SAW, shit was mad weird. I even turned the lights on and had a damn 10 min convo with myself. I was literally saying, \"just remember, you weren't asleep, you weren't tired, and fully awake, never forget, you saw what you actually saw, this was fucking real as it gets\" \nI've only told my girlfirend and the other day i tell my mom for the first time cause i think other people would think i'm crazy. She tells me her story of when she was 5, she saw a man made of static, tv snow. I have no choice but to believe her cause of my experience. I don't really believe in ghosts, however i believe that if the universe is so big, that it would be akin to being just a part of an atom thats part of some mass(Think \"Antman - Quantumania\"), then it would be foolish to think we are the only intelligent life.\nAnyways, anyone ever see something like this?", "media": null, "score": 27, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "comment_count": 10, "over_18": false}, "56": {"id": "1fpjkaa", "locked": false, "subreddit": "cryptids", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "Little-South-Paw", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1727492434.7276943, "created_utc": 1727310233.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/928mu3y4s1rd1.jpeg", "title": "The picture of the Fresno Nighcrawlers in Jeans was asked for a bit ago", "permalink": "/r/cryptids/comments/1fpjkaa/the_picture_of_the_fresno_nighcrawlers_in_jeans/", "selftext": "My sister painted this for me when she got bit by the creative bug.

What I am talking about is something like a dream but isn\u2019t, I call it Travel summoning or Ascension. Others think this might be astral projection. I do still have dreams, I\u2019m aware of dreams and can control them. That isn\u2019t this.\nWhy am I posting this?: To get answers and to hopefully find the other people I\u2019ve met in this situation.\nBackground/Further explanation before we get into everything: I\u2019ve been having these \u2018dreams\u2019 in which they aren\u2019t really dreams. I call it Travel Summoning or Accession. Others think it may be astra projection, but I don\u2019t know much about it so I can\u2019t really say at the moment. Before the events and traveling actually happen, I black out. Usually when I have actual dreams, I\u2019ll feel tired and I\u2019ll settle into bed, turning off lights, plug my phone in, set an alarm, lay down and close my eyes then diff off to sleep. With traveling however I have no recollection of ever falling asleep or even getting ready to fall asleep or feeling tired. It\u2019s one second I\u2019m watching something or doing something then boom I\u2019m traveling.\nThe first travel: This has been happening for a long time, but I was a child when it first started to happen. I would suddenly be in what looked like a hospital or research facility. Because I\u2019ve been there so many times, I know it like the back of my hand. I won\u2019t give too much detail about the place however in hopes others who have been there can PM me and describe it to me so I can see if we really went to the same place. But when I first went it was like a doctors visit. They were super nice at first. They would explain everything they were going to do. They introduced themselves (they later said they used fake names in order to protect themselves) and explained that I was very special and that I was selected to be part of a program. It was to see if I had anything else special about me. There was other kids too. A lot of kids. We would have to do certain things, like tests. If the kids failed it they didn\u2019t come back. I don\u2019t think they killed them, I think that they just didn\u2019t summon them anymore and the kids, now adults, probably think it was just some weird dream.\nThe tests: the tests are something I\u2019ve had to do over and over. Even as I grew I had to do different ones and such. They started out as basic. Math tests, spelling tests, history tests, morality tests, gym tests, science tests. Stuff like that. We wouldn\u2019t have classes on these subjects, but the classes we did have we did touch on the subjects here and there. The tests would then start to get weirder. They would do tests on us based on precognition/clairvoyance/telekinesis/ other stuff like that. There was more tests on different abilities, but I didn\u2019t score high on those ones so my specific training wasn\u2019t on those.\nEducation: We had classes of sorts to educate us and to prepare us for tests. The classes were on different abilities and such to see what child had the abilities. We had to do classes on so many abilities, because they said sometimes it takes a few times for it to be awakened. Along with these classes we of course would touch on mundane topics too like history, math, science. Mainly science as the workers were scientists and doctors.\nWorkers/Doctors: there was a bunch of adults that worked at the facility. Like I said they used fake names, wouldn\u2019t tell anyone where they are from or their age. I could only get basic information out of them such as have they been to New York, if they like cheeseburgers, what their favorite color was, basic stuff like that. If I asked more about the training/Education/tests they would just fill me in about what they could. If I asked something they couldn\u2019t tell me it was classified or I would learn later on when I\u2019m bigger. I gave up quickly about trying to get to know them personally, instead I would just talk to them about things that interested me like history and stuff. They gave me some information about things in the past and the truth about some things. Such as the organization has been going on for a while now, but not too old. I think they said they are younger than the cola company?\nBetrayal: Sadly things didn\u2019t go as smoothly as we got older. The other kids, now adults, and I that have stayed in the program are now in our 20\u2019s and we were told we had something big to work on. It was our first assignment. We were brought into a room where there was an object. They turned it on and explained to us that we needed to go threw it. That it was a portal. Our assignment was to explore the dimension. We denied. We were arguing with them, yelling at them. We were sobbing and crying saying no, that that\u2019s crazy. They pushed one of us in, another went after them. Some of us hesitated on going after them, but eventually we were all forced into the portal as they soon brought out weapons, giving us an ultimatum. (They later said they wouldn\u2019t actually have killed us, that we are too high of value to kill us, they just wanted to scare us). I\u2019m getting emotionally distressed as I type this, and I can\u2019t continue much longer as that first dimensional trip was traumatizing. We were lost on what seemed like a new planet. We could breathe just fine, gravity was similar. We were stranded in this dimension for almost a year. We lost someone there. We were injured. But eventually we got back. Now we have been doing this for a while. Traveling to different dimensions, more training.\nI have to stop here. I know I left a lot of information out, but it\u2019s emotionally draining and I don\u2019t want to give everything away in hopes to find someone who has gone through this.

Haven\u2019t seen you around, my name is H, you new in town or?\u201d \n\u201cHas anybody ever told you, that you have incredible eyes?\u201d \nThis simple statement made my blood run ice cold, at this point I tap the QD on the muzzle and it swings out of the way. \n\u201cI\u2019d like to think my mother used to tell me that; but can\u2019t say it\u2019s something I hear often? Listen man, you gotta get moving, if you don\u2019t live here I can\u2019t have you standing out here\u201d \nAt this point he sort of goes rigid, and reaches in his pocket, I don\u2019t give him the chance to do much more as I draw my weapon at this point. \n\u201cHey man, look you gotta leave I\u2019m not telling you again, I don\u2019t know where the fuck you\u2019re from, but I know it ain\u2019t from around here, last chance, fuck off.\u201d \nAt this point, he sort of slowly removes his hand from his pocket, and he\u2019s holding this little 35mm disposable, he lifts it, snaps a photo, then says. \n\u201cHave a good evening, your eyes are beautiful.\u201d \nAnd then off he goes. \nAbout five minutes later I\u2019m still shaking when the cops arrive, turns out one of the apartments close to the gate heard the dog going nuts and heard me raise my voice to our oddball friend, and called. \nThey tell me they\u2019ll up patrols, and that they hadn\u2019t gotten any other calls about the dude. \nWeird guy with the trench coat standing by my gate\u2026. Let\u2019s not meet\u2026. Ever again.

What I am talking about is something like a dream but isn\u2019t, I call it Travel summoning or Ascension. Others think this might be astral projection. I do still have dreams, I\u2019m aware of dreams and can control them. That isn\u2019t this.\nWhy am I posting this?: To get answers and to hopefully find the other people I\u2019ve met in this situation.\nBackground/Further explanation before we get into everything: I\u2019ve been having these \u2018dreams\u2019 in which they aren\u2019t really dreams. I call it Travel Summoning or Accession. Others think it may be astra projection, but I don\u2019t know much about it so I can\u2019t really say at the moment. Before the events and traveling actually happen, I black out. Usually when I have actual dreams, I\u2019ll feel tired and I\u2019ll settle into bed, turning off lights, plug my phone in, set an alarm, lay down and close my eyes then diff off to sleep. With traveling however I have no recollection of ever falling asleep or even getting ready to fall asleep or feeling tired. It\u2019s one second I\u2019m watching something or doing something then boom I\u2019m traveling.\nThe first travel: This has been happening for a long time, but I was a child when it first started to happen. I would suddenly be in what looked like a hospital or research facility. Because I\u2019ve been there so many times, I know it like the back of my hand. I won\u2019t give too much detail about the place however in hopes others who have been there can PM me and describe it to me so I can see if we really went to the same place. But when I first went it was like a doctors visit. They were super nice at first. They would explain everything they were going to do. They introduced themselves (they later said they used fake names in order to protect themselves) and explained that I was very special and that I was selected to be part of a program. It was to see if I had anything else special about me. There was other kids too. A lot of kids. We would have to do certain things, like tests. If the kids failed it they didn\u2019t come back. I don\u2019t think they killed them, I think that they just didn\u2019t summon them anymore and the kids, now adults, probably think it was just some weird dream.\nThe tests: the tests are something I\u2019ve had to do over and over. Even as I grew I had to do different ones and such. They started out as basic. Math tests, spelling tests, history tests, morality tests, gym tests, science tests. Stuff like that. We wouldn\u2019t have classes on these subjects, but the classes we did have we did touch on the subjects here and there. The tests would then start to get weirder. They would do tests on us based on precognition/clairvoyance/telekinesis/ other stuff like that. There was more tests on different abilities, but I didn\u2019t score high on those ones so my specific training wasn\u2019t on those.\nEducation: We had classes of sorts to educate us and to prepare us for tests. The classes were on different abilities and such to see what child had the abilities. We had to do classes on so many abilities, because they said sometimes it takes a few times for it to be awakened. Along with these classes we of course would touch on mundane topics too like history, math, science. Mainly science as the workers were scientists and doctors.\nWorkers/Doctors: there was a bunch of adults that worked at the facility. Like I said they used fake names, wouldn\u2019t tell anyone where they are from or their age. I could only get basic information out of them such as have they been to New York, if they like cheeseburgers, what their favorite color was, basic stuff like that. If I asked more about the training/Education/tests they would just fill me in about what they could. If I asked something they couldn\u2019t tell me it was classified or I would learn later on when I\u2019m bigger. I gave up quickly about trying to get to know them personally, instead I would just talk to them about things that interested me like history and stuff. They gave me some information about things in the past and the truth about some things. Such as the organization has been going on for a while now, but not too old. I think they said they are younger than the cola company?\nBetrayal: Sadly things didn\u2019t go as smoothly as we got older. The other kids, now adults, and I that have stayed in the program are now in our 20\u2019s and we were told we had something big to work on. It was our first assignment. We were brought into a room where there was an object. They turned it on and explained to us that we needed to go threw it. That it was a portal. Our assignment was to explore the dimension. We denied. We were arguing with them, yelling at them. We were sobbing and crying saying no, that that\u2019s crazy. They pushed one of us in, another went after them. Some of us hesitated on going after them, but eventually we were all forced into the portal as they soon brought out weapons, giving us an ultimatum. (They later said they wouldn\u2019t actually have killed us, that we are too high of value to kill us, they just wanted to scare us). I\u2019m getting emotionally distressed as I type this, and I can\u2019t continue much longer as that first dimensional trip was traumatizing. We were lost on what seemed like a new planet. We could breathe just fine, gravity was similar. We were stranded in this dimension for almost a year. We lost someone there. We were injured. But eventually we got back. Now we have been doing this for a while. Traveling to different dimensions, more training.\nI have to stop here. I know I left a lot of information out, but it\u2019s emotionally draining and I don\u2019t want to give everything away in hopes to find someone who has gone through this.

When I first moved there a friend of mine had made it a point to show me that someone could drive across the whole town within 5 minutes and at the time I didn\u2019t realize how important that fact would become to the safety of me and my loved ones. \nMy best friend \u201cHayley\u201d and I (her 17 & me being 18 y/o at that time) were hanging out at a park that was about a 5-10 minute walk from where I lived. And i say park because there were a few tables and benches and it was technically known as a \u201ctown park\u201d but in reality it was more a small grass clearing surrounded by woods and a dirt trail near the bank of a river. I had started to frequent this place after moving walking down to the benches and trail to smoke or sit by the water. I had never really noticed any suspicious characters before this, even though i had been plenty warned about a couple creepers that were in the area known for bothering young girls. \nHayley and I had been smoking for a bit unbothered in the clearing when we decided to finish out our trip with exploring the trail a little bit and just taking in the scenery. We had been walking and talking for about 5 minutes when I started to get this tension in my shoulders. Like that feeling you get when you know someone is looking at you. I had looked behind us and there was a man on the trail with us. Granted this path is pressed right against the side wall of a gated community so seeing people going on walks and jogging was fairly common. I told my friend of the man\u2019s presence but she had written it off as me being anxious but she had a good point i tend to be a bit hyper-aware at times, but something about the man felt wrong in my gut. \nWe kept walking and i would periodically look back and keep tab on the dark haired middle aged man walking about 50 feet behind us. After not too long at all the man started picking up his pace behind us. Calm casual walking became more of a speed walk, and I turned around completely and started walking backwards to try and communicate to this man that I was completely aware of his presence. He had made towards the side of the trail looking like he was going to walk through the brush down to the river and I felt a bit stupid. I turned back around walking forward again when i looked back just once more to be sure he was gone. But as I was looking behind us for the last time I see the man in a full sprint coming back onto the trail straight for me and Hayley. I grabbed her sleeve with one hand and ripped out my pocket knife with the other and I can\u2019t remember what I had said to her but we started sprinting down the trail as well.  \nI had never gone very far down the path and I had no idea where it was going to take us but the man running after us was blocking our path back to the clearing and the road but we could hear his footsteps on the dirt getting closer. I let go of Hayleys sleeve so I could pull my phone out and called my uncle as we were running. I told him we were being followed on \u201cthe trail at the park\u201d but I couldn\u2019t tell him exactly where on the trail because I had never been much further than the entrance and I had no idea where it lead to. My uncle had told me to stay on the phone and be loud so he could find me. I let out the loudest shrillest scream i could and we kept running until we reached what was the clear end to the path. We ran up on an old metal fence surrounding trees and what looked like an old abandoned house or shed. We had also reached the back corner of the outer wall for the gated community and in that spilt second this seemed to be our best bet. \nI ripped us off the dirt path into some trees lining the cement wall and yelled at Hayley to climb as fast as she could pushing her from the bottom so she could use a tree and the ledge to clear the top of the wall. I tossed my pocket knife and my phone over and I\u2019m not even sure how i scaled the wall myself but I scrambled up and over as fast as physically possible. I landed next to Hayley basically face first onto a neatly trimmed patch of grass inside the gated community scaring a poor man who seemed to just be outside walking his dog. I became really aware of how strange we probably seemed, two teenagers panicking and yelling while holding a knife but this man seemed to know we were in trouble. He came over to ask us what was happening and if we needed anything and Hayley started explaining our disruption to his calm neighborhood while i got back on the phone with my uncle and told him we made it into the gated community. \nNot even a minute later my uncle came barreling towards the end of the path and we could hear him shouting to the man on the trail that he had a firearm and all the things he was going to do with it. The man with his dog lead us to a little access gate a ways back on the wall and unlocked it for us so we could meet my uncle on the path. My uncle told us that he had drove his car through the park all the way up to the trail entrance as fast as he could and started running for us but he didn\u2019t see any man as he was going. He checked on us and i retold him what happened with more detail than i could\u2019ve managed in my initial panic. He escorted us back down the trail to the car, firearm in full sight at the ready in case the man on the trail decided to reveal himself. \nWe didn\u2019t see him on our walk back and I haven\u2019t returned to this place since then but any time that i had left the house before i eventually moved I was constantly paranoid i was being followed. We were never able to figure out who this man was and I haven\u2019t seen him since that day but to the man on the trail, let\u2019s not meet.
