This took place when she was only seven or eight years old. At the time of the incident, she was out playing by a river close to her home. She then saw a gray oval object on the other side of the river. It disappeared in and out of the forest. The girl waved and smiled at the craft. After a while it came slowly and calmly gliding over the river and landed close to the girl. Of course she didn't know what this was. A hatched opened and at first she thought it was people coming out of the craft, but then she saw they were not humans. The beings were around the same height as the girl. They were pale and had big, dark eyes, a small snarled mouth and a nose that was barely visible. Despite this, the girl was not afraid. They said that they were going to look at her and take some tests. The beings looked at her teeth, took off her boots and looked at her feet and then took some samples. When the survey was ready, they asked if she wanted to follow them and see how they were living at their home planet. The girl thought of her mother and therefore did not want to come along. Then they promised to come back again, entered the craft and waved to her. Then the craft took off and went straight up into the air. Finally, the craft was so small that the girl could no longer see it. The woman remembered that the beings had not been talking to her during the whole encounter. They had been communicating telepathically all the time.\nThe girl met strange beings and their craft at the shore of the river. (artistic impression)\nWas this an early authentic Grey encounter? Or was this only something from the girl\u2019s imagination, later \u201cremembered\u201d as memory by the woman and affected by pop-culture of what an alien should look like? We will probably never know...\nSource: UFO - NORSKE N\u00c6RKONTAKTER AV 3. GRAD\nHeld at gunpoint by an Alien.\nKolm\u00e5rden in Sweden, August 23 1967.\nThe witnesses wanted to remain anonymous because of this strange incident and fear from being ridiculed. A boy and a girl (lets call them \"Peter & Fia\"), both 15, were out walking on a small road one evening in a residential area in the small community of Kolm\u00e5rden. The time was around 8 pm when they passed an abandoned industrial plot, and they noticed a reddish glow descending without a sound into a nearby forest. The teenagers felt a little anxious and they also had a strange feeling of being watched, so they walked faster towards home.\nOn their way home Peter and Fia could see the red light once again hovering above the tree tops. And now curiosity takes over and they decide to investigate. When they reached an old uninhabited cabin in the woods, they could see small mysterious yellow lights hovering and moving around all over the place. They are surprised to see that some of the lights are also inside the old cabin. And they could hear the sound of someone pounding on wood. Now they also see the red light again and it is coming in lower towards them, and stops and hovers at a small stream nearby. Peter and Fia are now very afraid and runs out of the woods and onto the road and walks with a very fast pace towards the home of the boy\u2019s older sister who lived very close.\nWhen they reached the house of the sister they knocked at the front door, but no one answered. Seemed like no one was home. When they walk out to the road again, they see a round, brightly luminous object hovering about 3 meter (15 feet) in the air in front of them. Almost after they hear a strange whistling sound (similar to the sound produced by blowing on a blade of grass held between the palms and thumbs of one's hands) and footsteps, and finally a strange, small being jumps out (or maybe he was floating?) onto the road from behind some bushes, 10-12 meter (30-36 feet) away. It was only 130 centimeter tall (4 feet, 4 inches) and very skinny. Its face was at first in shadow, so Fia thinks it could be some kind of prank, so she is trying to get a few steps closer. But then the being looks in their direction with a nasty and intense gaze from its dark eyes and Peter grabs Fia\u2019s arm shouting \"Watch out, he is not human!\". \u00a0Suddenly the being jerkily raised its arms, holding a box from which a short tube protruded with a glowing bow above. The small humanoids\u2019s head was very large and covered by hair, a hood or a helmet, it had large black eyes, and a nose and mouth that together formed an \"X.\" It was bowlegged, and around each ankle it had a white-glowing wire or ribbon. The being appeared both tough and somewhat frightened and shivering at the same time. The witnesses were now terrified and fled for home.\nDetails from the encounter.\nThe next day, at the site of the humanoid-sighting, the boy found some apples that had been broken apart, some with the marks of 5 fingernails or claws, on the broken surfaces, and others that were coated with an ill-smelling slime. Also, deep, strange, footprints, 25 cm (6\") long and with 3 toes, were found outside the sister\u2019s house.\nDuring the two next nights, Erik's older sister heard soft footsteps and ticking and scraping sounds outside their home, and saw lights moving about the area. In the morning after this incident, they found out that two shutters had been torn.\nUfologist Sven Schalin could find no natural explanation for the case. He regarded the witnesses as sincere and serious when recounting the experience. Peter\u00b4s mother confirmed that the teenagers were shocked when coming home and Peter didn\u00b4t want to go outside after dark for some time after the incident. This was an unusual behavior on his part. \u00a0\nSources: APRO Bulletin, Sep.-Oct. I967, 1 & 5 and H\u00e5kan Blomqvist blog May 25 2014.\nThe mystery in Imj\u00e4rvi.\nImj\u00e4rvi in \u200b\u200bsouthern Finland, January 7 1970.\nIt was late afternoon and two friends were out cross-country skiing (Aarno Heinonen 36 and Esko Viljo 38). It was dusk, cold -17 degrees Celsius (1.4 F) and no wind. The men came to a clearing, where they rested a little. After a few minutes they heard a humming sound. Both Aarno and Esko looked up to see a bright light coming from the north, which looked like a brilliant, pulsating cloud. It stopped above the men and slowly began to descend towards them. At a height of about 15 meters (45 feet) they could make out a ship inside the cloud. It was maybe 3 meters (15 feet) in diameter and had 3 balls underneath (looked a bit like a typical Adamski-ship). The saucer now came closer and the buzzing got louder.\nThe case was featured in an issue of the Flying Saucer review and the picture shows the craft and the being inside the light beam.\nAt about 3-4 meters (15-18 feet) above the men it stopped and the sound stopped. The cloud had now almost disappeared. Suddenly they saw a bright beam of light from the underside of the ship, coming down towards the snow and illuminating it, like a lone spotlight on a stage. Now a red-grey mist also descends around the two men. Then the light disappears as quickly as it came. But soon it comes back and now they see a small creature standing in the middle of the cone of light 3 meters (15 feet) from them. It was one meter high (3 feet) and narrow. The face was pale and with small eyes and a sharp witchlike nose. On its head it had a pointy helmet or cap. On the body, the creature wore a light green tight-fitting overall or jumpsuit. It had dark green tall boots and white long gloves. In both of its hands it held a small glowing device, which it then pointed at Aarno and Esko. The pulsing light that came at the men was very bright and blinding. As the creature stood there and pointed the light at the men, sparks began to fly around the red-gray mist and the mist begins to thicken more and more. Finally, they could no longer see the creature or each other. Suddenly the beam of light on the ground got smaller and smaller and floated upwards towards the ship and disappeared. Then the fog also fell away. The forest was now quiet and empty and the men could see each other again. Of the creature and the ship there was no trace. They just stood there looking at each other in silence for several minutes.\nThe being had a green jumpsuit and a pointy hood or helmet. The facial features were very goblin-like.\nNow Aarno noticed that his right side felt strange, it stung, and when he took a step forward with the ski he collapsed. He couldn't get up even though he tried several times. Esko had to help Aarno home and it took them an hour to walk 2 kilometers (1.25 miles) through the snow. When they got home to Aarno's cabin, he had a backache, a headache, difficulty breathing and felt so bad that he had to vomit. When Aarno then went to urinate, the urine was black as coffee. These symptoms continued on and off for several months until the summer. He also had a fever at times and difficulty with balance. He was also unable to work during this period. Viljo also suffered from health problems. When he dropped off Aarno, his face swelled up and turned red. He also had difficulty with his balance. A few days later, Viljo started to become sensitive to light. And tingling in the feet appeared. Viljo's symptoms also remained for several months. Doctors who examined the two men believe they were exposed to radioactive radiation. In the month of June, a reporting team investigated the place where the two men had their terrible encounter that night. And several people on the team complained of headaches and red hands. Other people who visited the site after the incident have also claimed to have felt ill for days afterwards.\nExactly what really happened that late afternoon in Imj\u00e4rvi is still a mystery. And we will probably never get an answer. But we see similarities with other UFO cases where people have had close contact with UFOs, orbs or aliens, and that is that many have injuries similar to those caused by exposure of too much radioactive or ultraviolet radiation.\nSource: UFO-Sverige", "media": null, "score": 43, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "comment_count": 2, "over_18": false}, "10": {"id": "1escrhw", "locked": false, "subreddit": "cryptids", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "TheCryptidAtlas", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1723862716.4449952, "created_utc": 1723669610.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptids/comments/1escrhw/what_cryptid_do_you_believe_to_be_100_with_out_a/", "title": "What cryptid do you believe to be 100%, with out a doubt, completely real? - And what caused you to be such a firm believer?", "permalink": "/r/cryptids/comments/1escrhw/what_cryptid_do_you_believe_to_be_100_with_out_a/", "selftext": "I want to hear your story, evidence, or encounter that led you to be a staunch believer in whichever cryptid it is you believe in!", "media": null, "score": 296, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comment_count": 332, "over_18": false}, "11": {"id": "1esl9qy", "locked": false, "subreddit": "thetruthishere", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "legaladvice10293848", "link_flair_text": "Child Sensitivity", "time": 1723862716.7301304, "created_utc": 1723692827.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1esl9qy/my_toddler_is_freaking_me_out/", "title": "My toddler is freaking me out", "permalink": "/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1esl9qy/my_toddler_is_freaking_me_out/", "selftext": "A few nights ago my toddler woke up in the middle of the night screaming for me.

I don't live on the first floor of my apartment so I use the elevators. As I walked down the hall towards the elevators I heard sounds of what sounded like bad karaoke thinking nothing of it. However once I turned the corner it sounded like moaning, groaning, and screaming almost like someone was in pain. The noise of course getting louder once I reached the elevators. As I pressed the button to the elevators and waited I heard it clear as day \"HELP ME\" the voice coming from one of the apartment doors directly in front of the elevators . Of course my first instinct was to maybe knock on the door as check up on the person but I got this unsettling feeling immediately after, a gut feeling telling me not to do that especially not alone. I rushed back down the hall to my apartment not wanting to stand there a minute longer and to drag my husband over. As we reached the elevators once again we heard the strange noises, same voice screaming only this time it sounded like singing only no music and a very ominous tone. The only way to describe it would be like gibberish it didn't sound like a common language there was maybe a normal word here and there but other wise there where no full sentences I'd pass it off as someone being belligerent drunk, if only we both didn't get a bad vibe from it. The air felt heavy and uncomfortable as we listened, searching for signs of distress, then we heard the voice get closer to the door and bolted. My husband urging me to get in the elevator and go straight to work. Me telling him to lock himself in the apartment. So far nothing weird has happened but my husband did sleep with the lights on. Does anyone have any input? I feel like a need to smudge my apartment and use protection assets such as cinnamon and salt on the doorway/window sills.", "media": null, "score": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "comment_count": 1, "over_18": false}, "15": {"id": "1eqmwt4", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ghosts", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "AppalacheeQueen", "link_flair_text": "Captured Apparition ", "time": 1723862717.580862, "created_utc": 1723490984.0, "url": "https://v.redd.it/h0efcs8kbaid1", "title": "Apparition caught on home security camera?", "permalink": "/r/Ghosts/comments/1eqmwt4/apparition_caught_on_home_security_camera/", "selftext": "Captured by our in home camera.

I lived in a big city all my life, but at the beginning of April I moved to a medium sized town about 1 hour away from that big city, along with my sister and our 4 pets. \nThis happened after a month of living here. My sister was preparing her final presentation for her arts undergraduate which was going to be shown in the city, so she had to spend the whole day there to make her preparations. I was left home alone with our cats and dogs, so in the early evening I decided to go for a long walk with my 2 dogs. \nWe walked for like an hour, but about 5 away from our home as we were headed back I saw a man knocking on a door about a block away. I thought he looked a bit weird because he would knock on the door, look around, then knock on the door, and then look around again, but he didn\u2019t look dangerous so I just kept walking since I had to pass by him to take the street that would take me to my home. When I was about 10 meters away he looked my way and started walking towards me. He was tall and slender, and was carrying what looked like a box of candy. He asked me if I had any coins to spare, I told him \u201csorry mate, I only have my dogs\u2019 poopy bags, have a good one\u201d, and I was ready to keep walking when he saw one of my tattoos and stopped me. \nFor some context, I have tattoos. I\u2019m not heavily tattooed but I have several in my arms and legs, and since I was wearing shorts the ones on my legs were visible. The specific one he was looking at is of a ghost woman in a traditional Japanese style. As he stopped me he said \u201cthat\u2019s a really cool tattoo, would you give it to me?\u201d. I just laughed uncomfortably, thinking he was joking, but he was dead serious, just staring unblinking at my tattoo. He then continued talking, \u201cno? So you\u2019re just gonna let the maggots eat it? Such a shame, it would be better if a person ate it\u201d. At this point he raised his face and looked me straight in the eyes, with a very flat smile that seemed to be an attempt to be friendly, but only made me feel even more uncomfortable. \nHe then asked me for my name, and not wanting to antagonize him I gave him a fake one, let\u2019s say it was Regina. He then asked me if I lived in town, to which I also lied and said that I was from the big city and just visiting; he then told me he used to live in that city too, he lived on the streets downtown. He told me he used to rap in buses to get money, and just out of the blue started rapping about me, still looking me straight in the eye. He rapped about how I was very pretty, how amazing my tattoos are, and in his rap he said my name was Lorena. I corrected him and said my name was Regina and not Lorena, since I had a suspicion he realized I had given him a fake name and was testing me. He just smiled and nodded. \nHe then asked me if I\u2019d give him my number. I said that me and my dogs had to go home, that we were expected. He pointed at a butcher shop a block away and told me that we could sit over there while I gave him my number, that it wouldn\u2019t take long, but I told him that I couldn\u2019t, that the one waiting for me at home was my boyfriend, but I was lying again, since I was home alone. His smile faded a bit and he just said \u201cwell that sucks\u201d. \nI wished him a good evening and turned around to leave, only for him to drop to his knees and grab my leg with both of his hands. He started caressing my tattoo while whispering \u201cit really is a goddamn cool tattoo\u201d. My dogs are pretty friendly and they were very calm during this whole exchange, but when he grabbed my leg they started growling. I pulled my leg out of his hand, wished him a good evening again and just walked away as fast as I could. I took a longer way home to make sure he didn\u2019t follow me, and once home I took a shower and scrubbed my leg real well, since I felt gross after all that. \nLuckily for me I haven\u2019t seen him again, but for a while after that I made sure to cover my tattoos every time I went outside, just in case.

By pushing everything they can to you that destroys your vital energy.\nWhat is your vital energy and why should you care about it?\nIt is a mixture of both your parents genetic materials inherited from them at the time of your conception. This part is said to be with you all of your life.\nOn-top of theirs is then added your vital energy and this said to then go through three stages of evolution.\nThe first stage starts as an accumulation of what you ingest, your oxygen and sexual essence. For most of your life it develops and strengthens overtime but can get depleted or attacked because of what you ingest, your lifestyle choices, how frequently you orgasm and your manner of breathing.\nThe next level is when your vital energy has reached a high enough amount. It then transforms into a sort of ''etheric'' vapor and can be felt as neutral, negative or euphoric.\nThis is the level that was coined as \"Qi\" (pronounced Chee) by the ancient Chinese culture. This level is what is activated when experiencing Frisson, or as the\u00a0Runner's High, as the\u00a0Vibrational State\u00a0before an Astral Projection, as\u00a0Qi\u00a0in Taoism / Martial Arts, as\u00a0Prana\u00a0in Hindu philosophy, during an\u00a0ASMR\u00a0session and as\u00a0Chills\u00a0from positive events/stimuli. In ancient Chinese culture and ancient Indian culture, they observed that when its second stage of evolution gets activated, you can cause a few physical reactions like controlling your temperature, dilating your pupils, controlling your heartbeat, perspiration, smiling, teary eyes, flooding yourself with euphoria or activating in certain parts of your body and of course goosebumps.\nAfter successfully developing your vital energy in an healthy way and accumulating enough of its Etheric aspect, it refines itself even more and reaches the ''Spiritual Energy'' level where it increases your awareness of your spirit, your mental clarity, your power of focus, intent and is the key to accessing \"superhuman\" abilities.\nUnfortunately because of the agenda and societal influences pushed by these elites(liquor consumption, cigarettes, other short circuiting detrimental substances, pornographic content and the culture of wasting one's sexual essence) most people rarely develop the required amount of this vital energy to reach this stage.\nIt has been documented in various cultures and has been coined under many names like Bioelectricity,\u00a0Life force,\u00a0Prana,\u00a0Qi,\u00a0Runner'sHigh,\u00a0Euphoria,\u00a0ASMR,\u00a0Ecstasy,\u00a0Orgone,\u00a0Rapture,\u00a0Tension,\u00a0Aura,\u00a0Mana,\u00a0Vayus,\u00a0Nen,\u00a0Intent,\u00a0Tummo,\u00a0Odic force,\u00a0Pit\u012b,\u00a0Frisson,\u00a0Ruah,\u00a0Spiritual Energy, Secret Fire,\u00a0The Tingles,\u00a0on-demand quickening,\u00a0Voluntary Piloerection,\u00a0Aether,\u00a0Chills,\u00a0Spiritual Chills\u00a0and many more to be discovered hopefully with your help.\nTo delve deeper into how to control your vital energy check out the following three written tutorials.\nP.S.

One day, I drove my brother and myself to the dentist. While we were waiting in the lobby, I noticed someone had parked really badly right next to my car. Since it was new, I was pretty paranoid about it getting scratched or something. My brother went in for his appointment, and I decided to go move the car to a safer spot.\nAfter I parked in a new spot, I was walking back to the office. Just before I could cross the parking lot to get inside, a minivan with super tinted windows\u2014like, so tinted they had this weird blue hue\u2014pulled up so close to me that it almost hit me. I thought it was strange, but I just walked around it.\nAs I was heading to the door, I caught my reflection in the glass and noticed a guy getting out of the van and starting to follow me. At first, I didn\u2019t think much of it and just started walking faster, but then he started running after me. That\u2019s when I realized, \u201cOkay, this is actually happening,\u201d and I started running too. I barely made it to the door before he could grab me.\nThe door was glass, and I could see his reflection\u2014he was reaching out, like inches away from me. He looked like a totally regular guy, wearing a button-up shirt and khakis, which made the whole thing even more surreal. I ran inside, and he didn\u2019t follow, probably because he didn\u2019t want to be seen. I was completely shocked and kind of in denial about what just happened because it all went down so fast.\nI looked out the window and saw him holding a purple cloth in his hand\u2014no idea what that was about. He looked around, then got back in the minivan and sped off. I told the receptionist, but I was still pretty shaken up and confused.\nThe whole thing happened in less than a minute.

I was a little unsure about the 'purifying' part, and I used salt water as I didn't have any sage lying around, which may be why the ritual didn't work.\u00a0\nI ground my Vitamin C capsule into a powder and put it in a bit of water. I then pricked my finger with a compass needle and squeezed the blood out so that a little got in the juice. I covered the cup with a lid and a tissue (the lid had a hole in it for the straw). I said the required sentence and left 15 capsules on the table.\nAfter stating my request, my whole body did not feel much warmer, but I felt my hands heating up a lot so I took that as a sign that I could continue. I said the other sentence and ate one capsule. It tasted very bad, and, after attempting to swallow and almost choking, I spat it out onto a tissue (I\u2019ll probably use oranges if I do this again). I said the final sentence, poured salt into the juice and poured it down the drain as the recipe stated. I put a purple index card and black pen on my table.\nThat night, I did not dream at all, and, when I woke up, I found that capsules, index card and pen were totally untouched. So that\u2019s my experience for this.\nQuestions:\nAre there any ways of purifying that does not require sage or similar plants? I am a minor who lives with my Christian parents, and they might find it suspicious if I ask them to buy sage. Ideally, something that would not require fire at all. Would a sage candle work?\nCan you give Violet nonphysical requests? Like something that does not involve a physical item at all (think fame, love, anything along those lines.)\nDo you have to drink the blood juice? I believe the original recipe said something about drinking, but I\u2019m not too sure.\nWould it be possible to hide the offerings somehow? I live with other people, and they might find it weird that there are Vitamin C capsules/oranges just lying on my table, and tidy them away.

New to the community but this experience pops up in my head every once in a while and I wanted to share it and see if anyone else has experienced anything else similar. I\u2019m a total skeptic of all things strange but to this day it gives me chills. \nA couple years ago I was still living at home with my parents. Both of our bedrooms are upstairs. That particular night, my dad was working the night shift, so it was just my mom and I at the house. We hung out together that evening and then went our separate ways for the night, she went to her room and I went to mine.\nMy bed is positioned so that my head is as far away from the door as possible and my feet are as close to the door as possible, so when I sleep, I\u2019m facing the door. Around 2am, I woke up lying flat on my back because I felt like someone was staring at me from my left side (I know it was around 2am because after this happened I checked the clock, and this event couldn\u2019t have lasted longer than maybe a minute). I looked over, and clear as day there was my mom standing there. I remember vividly, she had on a white nightgown with little baby blue colored flowers on it that she wears all the time to this day and was standing quiet as could be next to me. \nI laughed kinda startled and I audibly said \u201cWhat the hell, you scared the fuck outta me! What do you want?\u201d It\u2019s entirely important at this point to mention that my mom and I are best friends (lol), so we always mess with each other. It isn\u2019t uncommon for us to have late night hang out sessions, so in my sleepy state it was entirely plausible that she had come over to wake me to go downstairs to get a snack with her or something.\nNot a peep. Absolutely nothing from her, no movement whatsoever. I said something like \u201cCome on what da hell\u201d thinking she was going to break and laugh, but nothing. At that point I started to worry thinking something was wrong with her, like maybe she was sick or something terrible had happened to a family member and she wasn\u2019t sure how to say it. \nAgain, I said \u201cMom what is it?\u201d As I said that, I used my left elbow (the elbow closest to her) to gain leverage to start pulling myself into a sitting position on the bed and began to twist to face her. One more time I said \u201cMom?\u201d And as I said that, I reached out to push/touch her on the shoulder to try to get some sort of reaction from her but my entire body slumped forward over the bed when she disappeared. COMPLETELY. Like, absolutely was not there. I almost shit my pants. \nI got up so fast thinking that I had completely lost it or she did pull something on me. I threw the light on and darted across the hall into her room, where she was (very peacefully) asleep with her breathing machine. I woke her up to ask her about it and was met with a lot of confusion and mild annoyance that I disturbed her slumber. \nI absolutely did not sleep the rest of the night. Anyone else ever have anything like this happen???\nTLDR; Creepy ass replica of my mom disappeared right before I could make physical contact with her.

I never knew what that was supposed to look like until last night when that man delivered that sentence. and lemme tell you, it's not sexy. it's fucking bone chilling.\nI've listened to enough true crime podcasts to take that as my sign to dip. maybe he was just joking, but I wasn't taking any chances.

I wasn't going to post an update because I wanted to let sleeping ex beauty queen stalkers lie, but I still get a ton of messages asking how things are going, I figured why not. We feel more protected now that it's over. Thank you again for all your kindness and support.\nHere's my original post https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/pbj64o/crazy_beauty_queen_stalker/\nTo recap, my husband dated a beauty queen of a well-known pageant before we met. Once we started\ndating, she went nuclear and it felt like we were living straight out of a Stephen King novel. It was a scary and stressful time, to say the least. I'm sure it would give her great satisfaction to know she affected our lives in such a negative way.\nLet me start off by saying, the court process is looooong. It took years for resolution. During that time, she had to live with an Assurer. For those who don't know (because I certainly didn't) the Assurer has to front up the bail money, which was over $1,000 but under $5,000 in her case, and have the defendant live with them while they are out on bail. Her initial Assurer was her mother, but after she was rearrested for continuing to harass us, the judge said that she had to have a new Assurer since she kept breaking the law under her mother's watch.\nSince Covid, everything is done via zoom and a virtual courtroom. There have been a few court dates during the past few years but only her lawyer was present. These court sessions were basically asking to defer, etc. It was all very long and drawn out. The last court date was last August of 2023. I was curious as to what she looked like now, and to have this finally behind us. Finally, she appeared in the virtual courtroom. She was no longer wearing the wig, it looked like she had some real hair, it was short, brown and pin straight. She was the same weight as I had last seen her in person and she was wearing a long white sort of coat, almost like a lab coat. No makeup. She was scattered, couldn't get her zoom to work, wouldn't come into focus in the meeting, even though the judge repeatedly asked her to be visible during the proceedings but she didn't listen to him, she kept going out of sight. She had the San Francisco bridge as her zoom background. Anyway, it was a gongshow. But in the end, the result of this last court session was that she didn't plead guilty or not guilty, instead she was able to agree to certain terms or risk being arrested again. To be honest, I found it slightly confusing but at least it was officially over.\nThe most interesting part for us was after the virtual court proceedings were finished, the judge told us we could switch off our cameras. We did - but she didn't. So my husband and I watched, fascinated, as the judge presided over other virtual cases and she, (on mute) sat on a chair and called someone on her phone. She began crying, then laughing hysterically, then crying again, but LOOKING INTO THE CAMERA as she's doing this. I couldn't tell if this was accidental or not. Was she trying to gain some sympathy or was it an honest mistake? We will never know.\nLastly,  I add this with a huge caveat that this is pure speculation. I had mentioned in my original post how she posted pictures of her dog's s*** with my name beside it. However, when my friend looked through the pictures, she observed that no way could s*** that size come from such a tiny dog. And when I look at it, I couldn't help but agree but my brain refuses to process. If it's true than...ew. However, this also will be something we'll never know. Probably for the best.\nEither way, karma has caught up with her big time. We know from one of the bail variation requests, she lives in subsidized housing. I haven't seen her since her in person since the original court date back in February of 2020. I received quite a few messages from people who knew who this was and said they had had run-ins with her, specifically a person who claimed a family member had been scammed out of money by her.\nThat's all there is to tell. Our lives have moved on and I'm happy to report that no news is good news. I'll always be extremely cautious about my social media settings but I don't think about her anymore unless I get a request for an update, etc. Thank you again for your messages and for all the support.\nAnd to the Crazy Ex Beauty Queen Stalker, we are thrilled to never meet again.", "media": null, "score": 145, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comment_count": 4, "over_18": true}, "70": {"id": "1esnhhb", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ghosts", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Mumbumbo_boi", "link_flair_text": "Personal Encounter ", "time": 1723862757.3822212, "created_utc": 1723700475.0, "url": "https://v.redd.it/henehddgmrid1", "title": "Evp I got alone in a cell block of Eastern State Penitentiary", "permalink": "/r/Ghosts/comments/1esnhhb/evp_i_got_alone_in_a_cell_block_of_eastern_state/", "selftext": "", "media": {"reddit_video": {"bitrate_kbps": 5000, "fallback_url": "https://v.redd.it/henehddgmrid1/DASH_1080.mp4?source=fallback", "has_audio": true, "height": 1920, "width": 1080, "scrubber_media_url": "https://v.redd.it/henehddgmrid1/DASH_96.mp4", "dash_url": "https://v.redd.it/henehddgmrid1/DASHPlaylist.mpd?a=1726454757%2COTcwMjgzZmQwMzc1MTE0ZjQyNjAzOTFjYjIzYTA2OWRlYzkyNTcxNTk0OTU4NzY2ZTlmYzIzN2ZjMGI4ZDY5NA%3D%3D&v=1&f=sd", "duration": 9, "hls_url": "https://v.redd.it/henehddgmrid1/HLSPlaylist.m3u8?a=1726454757%2COTUxMmQxYWFmZmY5YWQ0MDc4MWJhMmJmNjUwZDgzNWJmYWE4NDdmMWRjZjdiMWFlODY4ZDJkNzhjYjZiNTRhZg%3D%3D&v=1&f=sd", "is_gif": false, "transcoding_status": "completed"}}, "score": 53, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "comment_count": 45, "over_18": false}}}
