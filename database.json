I\u2019ve only ever seen black figures when I\u2019m at the park late at night. I kinda just assume it\u2019s me seeing things in the dark. \nAnother instance I have of regularing seeing a black figure is in the back seat of my car. Since I started driving in 2020, I\u2019ve always seen this black figure in the back seat, and friends have too. Along with 2 other figures, but those ones don\u2019t threaten me. Only the black figure. All the figures do in the car is sit there.\nA few weeks ago, I was getting water at 3 a.m. my kitchen is across from my bedroom and as I will filling up the cup, I saw what looked like a black figure rush from my moms room to my room. Only, it wasn\u2019t like a human. It crawled like a dog. Or like the girl from the excorsist and how she crawled down the stairs.\nI also sometimes see a black figure in the corner of my room. \nThen most recently, I was coming out of my room and saw a black figure walking in the living room but it quickly disappeared before I could understand what it was. Then saw my mom in the kitchen. \n\u201cYou weren\u2019t just over there?\u201d I asked her, pointing to the living room. \n\u201cNo.\u201d She laughed it off and didn\u2019t ask anything further, nor did I tell her anything more. \nMy dad and little brother have history of seeing black figures everywhere. They don\u2019t live us though. And I\u2019ve never seen black figures until the first time I was 16. I was playing with an Ouija board with all my friends at my birthday party. And suddenly I see a black figure go from one side of the room and to the other, then disappearing. I look up and everyone is staring at the wall the shadow went into. Even my boyfriend at the time who was just watching us play. He saw it too. That was in 2018 and I haven\u2019t touched an Ouija board since probably 2020. \nWe also haven\u2019t lived in that house since 2019. \nI have other paranormal experiences but these are the only ones with black figures.

", "permalink": "/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1c8g3ek/i_got_stalked_by_my_nightmare_of_a_tinder_date/", "selftext": "Trigger warning: SA\nThis happened in college. At the time I was 18 and a sophomore. I had just recently gotten out of a 6 year relationship and was starting to get into the dating scene. I downloaded Tinder and got to swiping. Some background: I didn\u2019t want to talk to someone that went to my university because thinking about running into someone I was talking to out in the wild really made me anxious. \nI ended up matching with this guy, we\u2019ll call him Marco. Marco was 20 and a junior at the neighboring university, about 15 minutes up the road. He had one selfie and the other two pictures he had were group photos, and they seemed older but didn\u2019t think much of it. We started chatting and very quickly he asked for my phone number. I would say it\u2019s a little too early for that but he kept insisting and I eventually gave in. \nAfter about two days of talking he started to ask for pictures so I would send selfies. He would ask for more provocative pictures and I kept shutting it down. Telling him I wasn\u2019t interested in that and I just wanted to see where things went. Marco would say how he couldn\u2019t wait to meet me so he could kiss me and every time he would say that I just changed the subject. \nWe planned a date after a week of talking. He said that he knew a good Indian restaurant over by his school and then we could walk in the downtown area after. I agreed as it would be in a public place. The day came for the date and again I started to get a weird feeling. I told my roommate what we had planned and she said she would keep her phone on her if I needed her. A few hours before the date I got cold feet and told him my car wouldn\u2019t start and asked to reschedule. He offered to pick me up and I kept telling him no and that we should reschedule but he kept insisting and started to make me feel guilty. He would say how he was looking forward to it for the past few days and I was hurting his feelings and that he would be more than willing to get me but I\u2019m not giving him the chance. \nWell I caved and it was the worst decision ever. Despite the feelings I was having I told him the information to get to the lot outside my dorm. Right when I got into the car I realized that this was probably going to be a horrible date. Right away he tried to hold my hand and asked to give me a kiss. I denied and he started to drive off. On the way to our destination he drops that we are no longer going to the restaurant and that we are going go to his apartment instead and he was going to cook me dinner.\nAt that point my heart sunk and I started to have a small panic attack. I texted my roommate letting her know. She was worried and said that she would come and get me if I needed. Again, not listening to my gut I tell her that it\u2019s fine and we get to his place. \nWhen I say this apartment was disgusting, I mean it was covered in trash, dirty clothes, and dishes. He said that we had to go into his room because his roommate was home and he didn\u2019t like it when he had company. His bedroom was even worse than common area. The was only a single path to the bed and to the bathroom it was so dirty. We sat in his bed and he turned on a movie. I can\u2019t remember the movie, all I remember is the stench of the room and him starting to make advances on me. \nMarco started rubbing my back, and shoulders. I kept scooting away trying to put some distance between us but it didn\u2019t work. After a few minutes he started to force himself on to me. He started to kiss me hard and holding my head so that I couldn\u2019t move it. I don\u2019t know how but he eventually was on top of me and forcing his entire body weight on me and I can\u2019t move an inch. I\u2019m paralyzed by fear. He doesn\u2019t get much further than that because as soon as he\u2019s on me, he\u2019s just as quickly off and running to his restroom, and he\u2019s throwing up. I have never been so thankful vomit. \nI don\u2019t know why he got sick. When he came out he apologized to getting sick, that \u201cit happens all the time\u201d and says he needs to take me home. Trembling I just get up straighten myself and follow him out. I still don\u2019t know if he\u2019s going to try anything else and I didn\u2019t want to aggravate him or say anything wrong so I tried to act like nothing was wrong to get home safely and that happens. He pulls up to my building tells me that he wants to make it up to me and I just nod say good night and get out of the car. \nOnce inside I blocked him, reported him on Tinder, and deleted the app. I also took extra measures to block him on any social media I could. I didn\u2019t tell anyone at first what happened. I was embarrassed because I put myself in that position. \nI started getting calls from random numbers and when I answered there wouldn\u2019t be anyone on the other line. I would block the number and a new one would be calling. It got to the point my phone was ringing constantly. After the phone calls were random Facebook and instagram messages from different accounts. They would say things like why are you ignoring me. Why aren\u2019t you talking to me. And then they started getting more aggressive and threatening. My roommate started getting messages and I had to tell her everything. She told me I needed to report him or at least tell my parents. I didn\u2019t do either because I was scared. \nThat is until I started receiving random pictures of myself. I would be walking on campus, in the dining hall, in class. Then I got one of me in my dorm room. It was taken through my window which was on the second floor, however, the Main Street was a hill that was the same level as my window and that is what my room faced, and my bed was in front of that window. \nI told my roommate and she made me tell our RA. The RA was very concerned and ended up calling the campus police. I made a report with them. The messages continued and so did the photos until one day about a week later he approached me on campus. He grabbed me by the arm and tried to take me to his car. I started to yell and luckily there was campus police near by. \nHe was arrest and was banned from my campus and I didn\u2019t hear from him again. \nThis was quite a few years ago so some of my memories aren\u2019t as vivid as I have tried to block this part of my past out. Not many people know that this happened to me. To this day my family doesn\u2019t know. The only people that know are my college roommate, the RA, the campus police, my therapist and as of the other night my fiance. I want to spread awareness of the dangers of online dating. Always trust your gut. If something doesn\u2019t seem right, it probably isn\u2019t. Not all online dating has consequences, I met my now fianc\u00e9 a few years later on facebook dating. But your gut is usually right and sometimes it\u2019s crucial to listen to it. \nWith that being said, Marco let\u2019s not meet again.

One day after months of this happening I told my mom and she informed me the woman had died a year ago and her youngest son owned the house now. This prettified me and I was scared to go out on my trampoline after this. I hadn\u2019t thought if it for 8 years, but took my dog out today and felt a little strange. I heard rustling and my dog reacting to something. I turned around and lo and behold the same woman is there sweeping the ground??? It\u2019s weird because a bit ago I told a pal about her as the thought randomly came into my mind but since that conversation aion I hadn\u2019t thought about it since. I grabbed my dog and went inside. I\u2019m pretty scared at the moment and wondering if you guys feel positive negative or neutral about this experience? Trying to feel better I\u2019m very scared!! She seems kind but just a overwhelming experience. \nEDIT: Also wanted to mention that I\u2019ve had a few I guess ghostly experiences before worth sharing. Once when I was 7 or 8 I woke up in the middle of the night to my mom standing in my room just looking at me. I even vividly remember wiping my eyes multiple times to confirm I was awake, I ended up getting scared and went under my covers screaming.

I wanted to put it out there to see if anyone else has experienced anything like it\u2026\nSo, I was visiting the States for work (I\u2019m from the UK) and had four days to burn before my flight home. I was in Denver and decided to hire a motorcycle and ride to LA, where my return flight was from. \nI had an incredible ride seeing some amazing things as I sped through Utah and into Nevada and I reached Vegas with two days remaining. I decided I wanted to ride through Death Valley and up to Yosemite before blasting down California to LA. By the time I got to Death Valley it was getting dark and , as I progressed through the national park it became pitch black with me being pretty much the only person on the road. The only things I could see what the illumination of my bike\u2019s headlights lighting up the road ahead and about 3m either side of the tarmac. \nI hit a long straight and started looking around. Something felt off. Then I noticed a large shape to the side of the road ahead. \u2018That\u2019s a big cactus\u2019 I thought to myself. I would put it at about 7ft tall. As I got closer I could see that it had humanoid features, like a very obvious outline of something with a head, shoulders, legs\u2026\nI was fixated on it as I rode and the closer I got, the weirder things felt. Then, as my bike\u2019s headlights lit it up, I could see it was a humanoid figure and, as I rode past it it turned its body to follow me. \nIt was nearly 50C and I had been sweating all day, but in the moment I was overcome with freezing cold and shivers. I still get the shivers when I think about it now. I twisted the throttle and got the hell out of there, repeating \u2018fuck\u2019 to myself in my helmet. \nIt was a very spooky and strange encounter. Anyone else seen or heard of similar encounters in Death Valley and able to shed any light on what I saw?

After it left we shut it down, then a nother was making motorcycle sounds but before we could activate the protocall again it got in, and then it all just went black after it had touched me on my leg.

I'm 25 F from England. \nSo I've never actually met this person.. so I hope this can actually go on this reddit forum (if it can't please let me know) \nThis started about 5 months ago and first of all it was quite a pleasant interaction.. but it as slowly got worse and more creepy \nSo it started about November/October..  I noticed that my wingmirror on my car had been put inwards (I park a street away from my house so I have a short walk to my house) (my house is on a main road with one drive and my parents park on the drive) \nI asked my mother if this was her as it was a thoughtful thing to do. She refused it was her and my father also said it wasn't him. So I thought it was a kind soul/ thoughtful person. After all where I park has a lot of older people and they always say good morning to me when I set off to work. \nThis continues for the months onwards (it has only recently stopped since parking away from that side street). I asked a couple older people on that street and they said it wasn't them either. (At this point I only wanted to say thank you).\nSo I continued going to work and didn't notice anything else until the winter weather got worse. \nDecember 2023 was when the weirdness continued. The frost kicked in and the snow started on occasions. Since I set off from work at 7am it can be frosty at that time and I would need to de-ice my car.  About mid December I remember running late for work it was 7:15am and I still had not de-iced my car. So I was doing a careful rush to my car as it was very cold and icy. Only to get there and see it had been de-iced for me... I was confused and a little happy but also shaken. It was a strange feeling. \nAgain I asked my parents and anyone I saw on the side street. It wasn't any of them. My mum laughed and said \"you might have a secret admirer\" well it's like she was a fortune teller. The de-icing of my car happened a few times more on very icy days. \nFrom January onwards is when it got strange to the point I started parking elsewhere (as mentioned above) \nAbout the end of January start of February 2024, I saw what I can only describe as home made food left on top of my car.. (don't worry I didn't eat anything) I ended up throwing these away once I got work. But I found this situation was getting beyond strange.\nAround the same time the first letter/note was left. It was written in what I would describe as \"doctor handwriting\" it was basically asking if I enjoyed being treated like and I quote \"the princess I deserve to be treated like\" I brought this home and showed my parents and they didn't like this at all... My dad said he was going to start parking on the street and I can park on the drive for a while.. \nI said that would be a good idea however if this person was looking for my car then he would know which house was mine.. my dad agreed but also pointed out that he/she may have already been watching me and may actually already know where I live... \nHe stated the main thing was me walking home from my car to the house at 8.15pm (I work 12 shifts) he stated he would sort the situation out if anything happened.  \nI questioned possibly going to the police and he stated that they would laugh at us without any proof. He was right we didn't have anything... I didn't like the idea of parking back on the street so I didn't. \nNow is April. I stopped parking on the drive a few weeks ago and know I've started parking on a different street still close to my house.. now nothing has happened since February... And I hope it doesn't as it was starting to get worse. Do I have a stalker ? Or just someone trying to f*ck with me ?\nI will try and answer whatever questions you have. When I can. \nTLNR - creepy \"acts of kindness\" have been happening to me and it might be the start of a stalker.

She didn\u2019t.  \nNow, this isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve \u201cseen\u201d a family member from the corner of my eye only to realize they hadn\u2019t walked by.  Back in 2011, I remember specifically because of a hurricane, I swear to God my husband walked past me while I was in that same bathroom.  I also swear he was naked.  After said storm passed, my \u201cnaked husband\u201d walked passed me in the living room while I was pulling on my waders (there was flooding post-storm).  A family friend won\u2019t go in our back room because of this same \u201cpresence.\u201d  As recently as this weekend, I was in the kitchen and I was so certain my daughter came in from feeding her goats and ran past me, that I went to the living room calling her for something.  But to have something imitate her voice, that one\u2019s really bugging me.", "media": null, "score": 250, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "comment_count": 106, "over_18": false}, "32": {"id": "1c4lzmw", "locked": false, "subreddit": "glitchinthematrix", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Solid_College_9145", "link_flair_text": "Glitch Pic", "time": 1713745330.7948275, "created_utc": 1713187061.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/atcc2d6o8nuc1.png", "title": "The twins are back on the job at the Trump trial today", "permalink": "/r/GlitchInTheMatrix/comments/1c4lzmw/the_twins_are_back_on_the_job_at_the_trump_trial/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 43, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "comment_count": 5, "over_18": false}, "33": {"id": "1c7zw3s", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ufo", "stickied": false, "category": "Aliens", "author": "awcomix", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1713745331.8461065, "created_utc": 1713540968.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1c7zw3s", "title": "Comics about the phenomenon - Updated", "permalink": "/r/ufo/comments/1c7zw3s/comics_about_the_phenomenon_updated/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 127, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "comment_count": 31, "over_18": false}, "34": {"id": "1c5oxku", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ufos", "stickied": false, "category": "Aliens", "author": "LongPutBull", "link_flair_text": "Document/Research", "time": 1713745333.8541837, "created_utc": 1713295693.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/tmmssybq7wuc1.png", "title": "Smoking Gun?

My parents were gone for a weekend for a trip together and left me and my two siblings home alone. Our grandma was a minute down the road if we needed her and my sister was 18 at the time so it wasn\u2019t a big deal for a night or two.\nI was in the spare bedroom which had a couch, tv, and Xbox 360 in it that I was really into playing or using to watch Netflix on (it was the summer of 2015 by the way). I was watching some random show, knowing me it was probably The Vampire Diaries at the time and it was maybe 9 or 10 at night. That\u2019s when I heard it: knock, knock, knock on the window. I ignored it at first, just thinking it was a little weird and just keep scrolling through memes on my iPod and watching tv when it happened again, which is about when I started freaking out.\nThe windows in the room had curtains over them so I didn\u2019t see who it was but I knew I needed to get the fuck out of there. I went to get my older sister and told her what was happening and as I moved through the house, the knocking on our windows followed me: knock, knock, knock. She and my brother heard the knocking on the glass, too, and started freaking out with me.  \nMy sister had me and my brother hide in the corner of our kitchen that doesn\u2019t have any windows looking in and made sure our front door was locked. We called our parents and then our grandma. They had us call our next door neighbor to take a quick look around. He was a Vietnam vet in his 60\u2019s at the time and we knew he had guns and training if needed. He didn\u2019t find anything. \nWe were all unsettled the rest of the night but knew our parents were coming home the next day. Fortunately everything was okay and it never happened again. \nTo this day, about a decade later, it still bothers me not knowing who it was. I have three theories which was progressively less probable: someone who escaped from an academy that\u2019s about 2 miles down the road from our house which is for juvenile reform for kids that got into legal trouble, the man that was sexually abusing me through that summer / winter but I don\u2019t think he\u2019d be bold enough to get that close to my house not knowing who was home (that\u2019s a whole other story), and the final option was my biological father who was barely on the picture at the time.

Understandably, she would be too busy to stay with me all the time, so I ended up staying at home alone a lot of times as an only child of divorced parents. It was a blast, honestly, minus evenings, I still get unnerved when staying alone at night. My aunt used to live with us too, but she was almost all the time at work.\nFor the context, it was the time when our version of \"HOA\" decided to hire foreigners for painting the stairs that lead to apartments on the 1st and 2nd floor. You can guess that we lucked out and were located right on the 2nd floor. One of our door locks looked quite flimsy even at first glance and the second, more sturdy one, recently stopped properly functioning, hence every time when either my mom or my young aunt went out, these workers had a full display of that miserable lock, barely turning in. My mom was too busy and probably tight on money to change the locks promptly (and too stressed to notice the tempted gazes of the workers), while the latter sized up our door each passing day.\nThis standstill broke one evening. Prior to this, me and my mom had our usual episode, where she would insist on taking me with her to work, meaning some strangers' homes, and I would whine, because I felt too awkward there. Usually, she lets me have my way but that time was an exception as she almost forcibly took me away with her. 1.5 h tutoring session went by swiftly while the parent of mom's student gave me some cookies to munch on. It was a nice start for the evening.\n\nOr maybe not. We came back home with hands full of groceries only to see a door slightly open ajar with a hole in the place of the flimsy lock. I have never seen my mother so scared, her fear rubbing off to me at that moment. She didn't even attempt to look inside and instead turned to neighbours while clutching my hand tightly. We were close to one old Russian lady, that was brave enough to enter first to see our apartment upside down, with all of our belongings pulled out from cupboards. Oh boy, was I glad to be next to mom and not, well you know where.\n\nIt was era predating the advent of online banking so everyone kept their money in stash among their clothes or under the pillow, so I imagine they searched for some cash. In the corner cupboard there were 6 shelves, 5 of which were emptied out, and the fifth one starting from the top, was mom's designated cash keeping shelf (or 4th, I don't remember). Anyways, few days before she suddenly changed its location and put the money between the pages of one book and after setting down we found money safe and sound.\nWell, then the situation proceeded as usual, we called police that took all the fingerprints and all our other relatives, who came to comfort my mother. I was too little to fully comprehend the horror of not feeling safe at your own property and stupid enough to be content to see the Ipad gifted by dad, surviving the burglary.\nThere were rumours of police finding the burglars and sharing their loot together, I guess that was what happened to my mother's first laptop that she bought on her money from that tiring gig of tutoring and still had few months of payment and some other valuables like jewellery. The funny thing is that I saw some of these workers that were prime suspects after the \"event\", going around wide eyed and highly alert in the vicinity. Alas, my mother was a single mom with young sister and a child to boot, so she didn't actively retaliate against them. These a-holes, where you are, let's not meet.\nSo, that's the lesson, if you randomly get a compelling thought, or a bad feeling, or even experience a slightly faster beating heart for no reason, you better comply with your gut, or Creator's sign as I believe (you can interpret it however convenient, scientifically, religiously etc). I don't like imagining what could have happened to me, had I managed to stay behind that evening, or our financial predicament if that stack of cash was found out. But oh well, it's good that it ended well.\nOh, and second lesson is for me, to never forget my caution and be forever thankful to my mother for getting me through countless situations and safely sheltering me from any harm until I could start standing on my own.\nEdit: is this even valid? Now that I checked the other stories seem much more raw while mine is admittedly on the lighter side.

", "permalink": "/r/Ghosts/comments/1c5yjqq/lizzie_borden_took_an_axe_and_someones_ghost/", "selftext": "So here we go, it was the year 1999 and my daughter comes home from school with am assignment to write an essay on someone famous. She asks me, \"Who should I write about? I don't want to do Washington or Lincoln or someone like that because EVERYONE was doing an essay on them and I want someone different.\" So being who I am I suggested that she do a report on Lizzie Borden. She then proceeded to ask me who Lizzie was and I tell her the story and the STILL unresolved murder case. My daughter hung on every word i said and was captivated. She had to present her choice to the teacher the next day for approval. I told her to present it and see what she says. The next day she comes running home and yelling that the teacher approved and she was so excited. So I take her to the library to do some research and I'm watching her and her eyes get wide as saucers and she cautiously looks up at me with a bit of fear in her eyes. It wasn't what had happened that scared her but the fact the Lizzie and I share the same birthday and love for fishing. Plus we share some of the same facial features and hair color a bit. Kinda spooked her. Flash forward a few days and the local news has a story about the Borden house being bought and the new owners turned it into a B&B and they give tours. Perfect!!! I call and see if we can tour it as my daughter is doing a report and they were ecstatic of helping out with a young person's education. We take the trip down to Fall River, MA and I was amazed that the town and historical society preserved the space of the street in front of the house from that actual year of the murders. Really cool I thought. We go in and meet the tour guide and we're allowed to take pictures since it was for a project. I opted to take the pictures for my daughter as I have been a fan of Lizzie for as long as I can remember and know the crime scene pictures that were taken back then. Only difference between mine and the originals were no dead bodies in mine and they were in color. We make our way to the second floor and eventually we find ourselves in Lizzie's bedroom. Now the Borden furniture had been placed in storage and unfortunately the building it was in collapsed and destroyed the original furniture. All the furniture in the house had been donated over the decades and were of the same time as the originals. They had letters from the B&B everywhere explaining this and that the furniture is now considered irreplaceable and to please be careful. The was a young man with us that was learning how to be a tour guide and he followed right behind me. In Lizzie's room was the dress that Elizabeth Montgomery wore in the Legend of Lizzie Borden movie which she played Lizzie. There was a letter writing desk against the wall at the foot of Lizzie's bed and this is where it happened. I bent over and hovered above the desk and was very lightly touching the desk as I read the letter of the furniture and so forth. All of a sudden, the desk shakes and shifts from left to right directly under my fingers. My eyes got huge and my excitement was beyond measurable. I looked at the young man in hopes that he saw what just happened to make sure I wasn't imagining it. Low and behold this young man turns white as a ghost and runs out of the room. My experience had then been validated. I caught up with the tour and the woman asked where the young man was and I told her what happened and that Lizzie scared him. Might have been Lizzie, I don't know. Could have been her father Andrew or her stepmother. Long read I know but felt like sharing this here.

The dimmest bioluminescence was recorded late at night.\nThe Vital energy I was manipulating that night is something that was researched and documented under many names, by different people and cultures, like Bioelectricity, Life force, Prana, Chi, Qi, Runner's High, Euphoria, ASMR, Ecstasy, Orgone, Rapture, Tension, Aura, Mana, Vayus, Nen, Intent, Tummo, Odic force, Kriyas, Pit\u012b, Frisson, Ruah, Spiritual Energy, Secret Fire, The Tingles, on-demand quickening, Voluntary Piloerection, Aether, Chills, Spiritual Chills and many more to be discovered hopefully with your help.   \nIt is apart of everything and within you it is that extremely comfortable Euphoric wave that can most easily be recognized as present while you experience goosebumps/chills from a positive external or internal situations/stimuli such as listening to a song you really like, thinking about a lover, watching a moving movie scene, striving, feeling thankful, praising God, praying, etc.\nThis is what people experience as Frisson, or as the Runner's High, or as the Vibrational State before an Astral Projection, or as Qi in Taoism and in Martial Arts, or as Prana in Hindu philosophy and during an ASMR session. \n\u200b\nYou can also learn how to use this technique to experience this, here are three written tutorials to help you specifically learn how to.\nP.S. Everyone feels it at certain points in their life, some brush it off while others notice that there is something much deeper going on. Those are exactly the people you can find on r/spiritualchills where they share experiences, knowledge and tips on it.

Some users believed that this was an undiscovered subspecies of Desert Bobcat, due to notable discrepancies with its snout and tail.

There was a marshy area behind our house, separated by a small wooded area. I remember almost every night for about a couple of weeks, waking up to strange lights in the wooded area behind the house.  My room was on the second floor of the house, facing the rear towards the wooded area and I could just see.the edge of the marshy area through the trees during the day. My parent's room was directly across the hall, facing the front of the house.\nI remember going into my parents room and telling them about the lights, but my mom would always send me back to bed without checking. I got so scared that I'd hide under my bed when the lights were happening. Around this same time I started seeing small, bipedal creatures that stood about 2.5 feet tall with large, black eyes coming out of the woods and trying to get into the house. \nWhen I told my parents about them, they would say that they were just bad dreams and not to worry. Almost every night, after seeing the lights, they'd come out of the marshy area / wooded area, try to get into the house and I'd hide under the bed, too scared to do anything else. \nEventually, the lights stopped and they stopped coming out of the woods. My parents still think I was having recurring nightmares.
