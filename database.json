I tore my whole room apart and they weren\u2019t there. I put EVERYTHING back and my floor was completely clear. I left the room, asked for help to find it, I walked back in, and they were laying right there, the only thing on the floor. (Not sure if this was help from Saint Anthony, since this was before I known about him or the prayer, I just generally asked for help) \nA few months ago I was looking for my bluetooth speaker, couldn\u2019t find it anywhere. I prayed to Saint Anthony for help finding it.  soon as I asked, I walked downstairs, just as I did, my mom was walking in my house. She comes often so I asked if she knew where it was, she said she has it and borrowed it. This was the most crazy one to me since she just so happened to come right when I asked for help. \nYesterday I was looking for an item I just bought. I checked the bag and it wasn\u2019t there. I checked around and couldn\u2019t find it. I prayed to Saint Anthony for help. Something then directed me to check in a space in between my bed, somewhere I would have never even thought to check originally and right there it was. This happened just a second after I asked. \nThere were two times I did ask and I wasn\u2019t able to find them, so that makes me think those items are long gone, somewhere not in the house. \nI don\u2019t know, I just think it\u2019s so amazing.

I lived in a relatively safe neighbourhood - but my country does have a high crime rate in general, so take that with a pinch of salt.\nMy dad had passed away earlier in the year, and I had no siblings, so my mom and I lived alone in our house. The Covid lockdowns were still in place, but as certain restrictions were lifted, people were starting to return to work.\nBetween my house and the train tracks was a stretch of empty field. It became a safe, quiet space for me to escape to whenever I needed to get out of the house. I would normally sit there once a day for a cigarette or two, sometimes for a little picnic. My home situation was complicated, to say the least, and due to the pandemic I had nowhere else to go.\nOn this particular day, I went there for a few minutes to smoke, as always. I was about halfway through my cigarette when I noticed a young man walking along the train tracks, on the other side of the field. He was barefoot, and wearing dirty, worn-out clothes. He noticed me, and made a hand gesture suggesting that he was asking for a smoke. I should have just left, but as a teenager, I found it difficult to say no to people.\nI walked across the field and handed him a smoke. He took it from me and I immediately felt uneasy with the way he was looking at me. He asked me: \"Don't you live in that house over there?\" and pointed at my house. I avoided answering the question, and at this point realized that I needed to leave. I had left from my front gate that day. For him to know where I lived he must have watched me leave from the back gate before. I told him I needed to get going. He started insisting on giving me a hug to say thank you, and I declined several times.\nAt this point, I turned around and started walking away quickly. I didn't get very far. He caught up to me, and put his arm around my waist. I panicked - not knowing what to do. All I could think of was that I needed to get away. As I tried to start running, he grabbed me from behind and started dragging me  toward the row of houses, where the view from the road is completely blocked. The fences were high too, so no one could see the field from their backyards. We were completely isolated.\nI was kicking and struggling, desperate to get out of his grasp. He ended up throwing me on the ground, with him on top of me, still holding on. In a split second, my life flashed before my eyes. That feeling that something terrible was about to happen came over me. I couldn't escape - he was too strong. My arms were trapped by his and he was holding me down, so I couldn't kick him. I did the only thing left to do and I started screaming for help.\nSuddenly  I was free. I could move. He had let go, and jumped off of me. He ran away. My heart was still pounding. I was shaking, in shock from what had just happened. He disappeared into the industrial area on the other side of the train tracks. I immediately ran towards the road. As I reached it, I noticed it was empty. There were no cars parked in my neighbors' driveways. No one heard me screaming, and had he realized, that day could have had a far worse ending.\nHe knew where I lived, and I was terrified of him returning. For months, I had panic attacks and nightmares and I could barely leave my house without breaking down. I moved away from there a year later, but I still sometimes get scared when I'm home alone or walking around town.\nThankfully, I never saw him again and I hope that I never will.", "media": null, "score": 296, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comment_count": 12, "over_18": true}, "13": {"id": "1788jre", "locked": false, "subreddit": "morbidhistory", "stickied": false, "category": "Crime", "author": "dannydutch1", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1697855727.0471175, "created_utc": 1697348181.0, "url": "https://www.dannydutch.com/post/this-is-why-mata-hari-was-not-the-spy-you-thought-she-was", "title": "October 15 1917, the Dutch dancer and courtesan Mata Hari was executed by firing squad.

Great, a house with a reputation for being haunted \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f our last house, btw, was not haunted but built on land that used to be a cemetery. \nIncluded the pic of the house because people say our house looks haunted lol As you can see from the ladder and the state of the porch, we are doing more work on the house. It's not surprising the activity is picking up again.\nThe other night, he got up to use the bathroom. The bathroom used to be a butler's pantry and connects the formal dining room (which we turned into a bedroom) to the kitchen. The bathroom mirror was opened so that while you couldn't see yourself you could see into the kitchen. \nHe said he saw the reflection of a male with a full head of hair walk across the kitchen. My husband is bald.  Woke him right up. He ran into the kitchen thinking someone broke in. Naturally no one was there. He's been having trouble sleeping ever since. He's very creeped out about it and is talking about blessing the house (again). \nHe's explained away every other experience, but this one he can't. Example: our front door has a very distinct sound.

I had my 1st \u201cencounter\u201d so to speak about 3 hours ago\u2026this is Southeast Oklahoma not far from Cavanagh Hill. I had came back from our storage unit getting some winter clothes out to bring home. As I returned home I pulled into our driveway killing the lights as I always do. I parked at the far side of the circle drive opposite the house. There are some shrubs tall grass grown up etc on a burn pile next to the circle drive then it opens up with a couple of pecan trees and flower producing bushes of diff sorts and then about 15 yards beyond that is a barbed wire fence. So I pull in and park, get out, and i smelled an awful kinda wet dog skunk smell that i didnt think to much about cuz we had been smelling this smell off and on for the last few weeks and thought we just had a skunk around but it was strong so i just thought a skunk was closer but it wasnt like overpowering or anything so wasnt a big deal. Well I walk around the front of the truck and as soon as I reach to put my hand on the door handle I hear an extremely low growl not like a dog growl it was lower almost like a \u201chmmm\u201d with a very very deep low raspy voice sound that and was a completely different sound i\u2019ve never heard. As I hear this the hair on my neck and all over my body stand on end and goosebumps bad and I froze briefly (ive lived in the country all my life and have never heard anything like it by any animal) and out of the corner of my eye is a very very large silhouette about 12-15 yards from me. Just on my side of the fence behind the 1st pecan tree. It was an extremely wide silhouette and if i\u2019m guessing about 8-9 feet tall. Just a massive figure but i could not make anything else out as far as certain features it was in the dark and slowly in a single fluid motion eased back further and more behind the tree. I about sh!t myself being quiet honest but i acted like I didnt see it, i opened the door and grabbed the clothes and when i shut the door i noticed the figure was gone and i walked on around the truck and made my way inside. Now I am of sane mind as the next person and am not on drugs, nor have I had any alcohol beverages this evening. My wife asked me what was wrong and i just said nothing until we came to bed and I told her and she all but laughed at me. But, here we are shes asleep and i\u2019m typing this up while i cant hardly believe what happened still. I just don\u2019t know what to make of it. I\u2019m still pretty freaked out over it as well.

For more background on Lue Elizondo, check this page on Key People in Disclosure.\n\u200b\nOctober 15th \u2013 NewsNation releases the first instalment of a multi-part series covering George Knapp's \"UFO Files\"\nNewsNation, the media entity that aired the original interview with whistleblower David Grusch & investigative journalist Ross Coulthart, have started airing a new special that dives into the UFO files in possession of the well-known (and prize-winning) journalist George Knapp\n\u201cI have secret stashes of files and things all over the station,\u201d Knapp said in an exclusive interview with NewsNation's Brian Entin. \u201cMountains of evidence compiled from the government\u2019s own files.\u201d\nWatch the first instalment on youtube here.\n\u200b\nOctober 9-15th \u2013 Multiple Members of Congress reaffirm their dedication to UAP transparency in light of the ongoing search for a new Speaker of the House\nIn a recent tweet, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna indicates she believes Rep. Jim Jordan may, in fact, be supportive of a UAP Select Committee to investigate the claims brought forth by whistleblower David Grusch.\n\u200b\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jmk7b5ym5lub1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bdfc29083e1f9c9e669aea9f1fe819b16245de5c\nSimilarly, Askapol asked Rep. Tim Burchett where then opponents, former Speaker-Designate Steve Scalise and current Speaker-Designate Jim Jordan, stood on the topic of UAP Disclosure. He stated:\n\"I don't know. I don't know. They both agreed that we need to do something about it, though. So I'm confident there. I'm not worried about it,\"\n---\nThings to look out for in the near future:\nOctober\n\nAccording to Senator Gillibrand \u2013 an updated UAP report from AARO can be expected within a matter of weeks. This update was originally expected in August 2023, but faced delays.\nIn line with this updated report, Gillibrand also mentioned \u2013\"I'll probably have another hearing aligned with that public report.\u201d\nOn October 17, NASA will hold another public meeting to discuss the Final Report of the ESAC Subcommittee Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) Independent Study Team (Link).\n\nNovember\n\nThe SOL Foundation is holding its first annual conference at Stanford University on November 17-19, 2023. Covering everything from the scientific study of UAP data to philosophical questions raised by it to related global security issues, the meeting brings together Avi Loeb, Charles McCullough, Cristopher Mellon, Garry Nolan, Jacques Vall\u00e9e, and other leading academic and government voices on UAP.\n\nBeyond/currently unknown\n\nWhile the US Senate passed the NDAA for FY24 \u2013 which included the UAP Disclosure Act of 2023 as an amendment \u2013 the coming months will still require Senators and Members of Congress to reconcile the two chambers\u2019 versions of the NDAA and produce a final compromise bill. Most commentators don't expect this to happen before December 2023.\nFollowing the UAP hearing on the 26th of July, Members of Congress have called for a select committee with subpoena authority, to \u201cgo about the task of collecting information from the Pentagon and elsewhere\u201d on unidentified flying objects. There have been conflicting messages from various Members of Congress on whether this is likely to happen anytime soon.\nReps. Moskowitz, Luna, and Burchett have repeatedly stated their intent to hold field hearings to overcome stonewalling from the Pentagon and military establishment\u00a0\u2013 \"I think we [Congress] should try to get into one of these places [housing UAP evidence]...and if they won't let us in I think we should have a field hearing right outside the building...and the military will have to explain why that is.\" \u2013 Rep. Moskowitz (D). It is currently unknown when we might expect that to occur.\nSeveral journalists have indicated that first-hand witnesses of the alleged UAP legacy programs are in the process of providing testimony/evidence to the relevant authorities (e.g. the IC IG) and/or are on the verge of making public statements in the near future (Example 1, example 2, example 3)\n\nReminder \u2013\u00a0Call your Reps!\nVarious members of congress will be deliberating key UAP legislation in the next days/weeks, so I put together a list of names, emails, & numbers (+ handy scripts/templates) in one easy place for reference.\nIf you have the time, please do call/contact these reps & remind them sunlight is the best disinfectant! In my opinion, it's especially important that we voice our support for Senator Schumer/Rounds' UAP Disclosure Act legislation, which is (in my opinion) a great first step towards furthering UAP transparency as a whole.\n--------\nSkimmed through this post but need a quick refresher on how we got to this point?

Calvin Seward and state forensic criminologist Dr. Todd Steffy were also present at the announcement during a news conference Thursday in the Bi-State Justice Building.\nWeldon Alexander died in 2014 at the age of 80. The children's mother, Vera Alexander, died by suicide in 1984.\nLong thought to have been working at Cooper Tire and Rubber Co. the night of the killings, Weldon Alexander had never before been considered a suspect.\nBased on evidence Seward and Steffy presented to her Oct. 4 \u2014 including DNA collected at the crime scene \u2014 Mitchell would issue an arrest warrant for Alexander for two counts of capital murder.\nIn the early morning hours of April 8, 1981, 13, and Karen, 14, were brutally murdered in their home in the Carmichael Hill neighborhood of Texarkana, Arkansas.\nInfamous murderer Henry Lee Lucas claimed in 1984 to have killed the Alexander children, but like most of Lucas' hundreds of confessions, that one proved to be false. Further investigation showed he could not have been in Texarkana on the day of the murders.\nIn 1981, Seward was a young TAPD patrol officer who lived in the same neighborhood as the Alexanders. He never forgot the crime, and after his retirement as a captain, with the department's support, he began to reexamine the case.\nSeward brought in Steffy to help take a fresh look at a large amount of evidence, reports and notes compiled by police at the time of the murders. Both hoped advances in DNA technology would break the case.\nA Facebook group dedicated to finding justice for the Alexander children has been active in bringing renewed attention to the crime.\nThe first, current season of the Gazette's podcast \"True Crime Texarkana\" tells the story of the Alexander children murders and their aftermath.\n\nI am from Arkansas and only heard of this case last year when the Facebook page began circulating a ton of new information.  I know nowadays, the parents are the first ones to be suspected....but it seemed like he had a solid alibi and was never considered. (he may have been, but I never even saw it speculated).  \nWhy its even crazier....Karen did not die during the attack.  She was in the hospital for several days after the attack.  Her murderer was 100% allowed to visit her.  Can you imagine, being attacked like that, incapable of telling anyone who hurt you and killed your brother while they have open access to visit you?\nThis was on a school night.  According to friends on the Facebook group, Karen had begged them to spend the night that night while her mother was in the hospital.  I guess now we know why.  \nThe mother was in the hospital for depression.  She committed suicide after their murders.  \nThis man had everyone fooled.  Had everyone's sympathy until he died in 2014.\nSo much to unpack.\nIm not sure if I can post a link to a Facebook page here...but I suggest searching for it on Facebook because it contains a wealth of information not available anywhere else. I apologize, the FB group is private and the admin has paused all activity for a month. Guess mentioning the group on here probably wasn't the best idea.\nEdit: I apologize for not adding additional information after initially posting this.  Things got really busy at home.

I was 20 back then.\nAt the time, because of the severity of the pandemic in Belgium, the law stated that you could only go out to practice sports or to work so I took the habit of meeting with a friend (Sully) to go out for runs and to practice all kinds of sports in general.\nBoth of us were quite fond of urban exploration and knew a spot in the outskirts of Brussels consisting of an old sports and wellness center where we took the habit to hang out after our runs.\n(To get into the spot, you must go through a hole in a fence on a street, cross a small portion of woods and you'll come up on a football pitch and tennis courts and up on a hill is the center which is an old 4 story building. The hole center takes a whole street block) \nOn that day, we had just finished a 5km run and went to our spot as usual, we where walking to the building since it was about to rain when we saw 2 teenagers sitting on the roof edge and I remember thinking that it bothered me since we were planning to to to the roof as well, so we went to the hall area to wait for a bit in hopes that the people leave. \n(In the hall area, you have a clear view into the kitchen, which you must go through if you want to go to the roof, you can also see into another smaller hall and into the dinning room.)\nSully was rolling himself a cigarette whilst I was gathering 2 chairs and an office table for us to sit. \nThis next part gives me chills to this day. \nAs I finished setting everything up, I remember starting to feel unwell, as I was being watched, and not in a good way. That's when I looked at the kitchen and saw, for a brief moment, a head sticking out of the door frame and staring right at us.\nIt was a man, I couldn't say what age he was since he was all dirty but the one thing I remember is that he had an exaggerated happy expression on his face, like he had just found exactly what he was looking for. \nAt that moment, I just froze and was unable to react bravely yo the situation. I leaned slowly towards Sully all whilst keeping eye contact with the man and told him very calmly that we had to go immediately.\nI tend to make lots of jokes to all of my friends and especially to Sully but when he saw the look I had on my face when I told him we had to leave, he didn't say a word, just took hist backpack and stood up. We ran to the football pitch and saw that the two teenagers where still on the roof so we started to tell at them asking if the man was with them or if they saw him but they answered that \"no\" they hadn't seen anyone and had come by themselves so if someone was there, he wasn't with them.\nWe told them it was probably better for them to leave as well since we didn't know what the man in the lobby was up to. They told us they would be fine and they would leave a bit after. \nWe decided to leave since we had already told them what we saw and we also had already been out for very long so it wasn't very legal with confinement rules. \nAs we where walking towards to woods, I turned back and I could swear I saw silhouette standing in front of the stair case leading to the roof but my mind didn't quite react and I just left alongside with my friend.\nI was so shocked (because nothing like it had happened to me before) that I just decided not to talk about it to anyone in fear of them not believing me or possibly making fun of me.\nMy friend Sully is the only one who was there, he didn't take a look at the man but he is as scared as me just by seing my own reaction at the time. \nI don't know what happened to these teenagers, I found local articles and papers dating from that time about teenagers being chased by a crazy man in an abandonn\u00e9s building but the information given wasn't enough for me to be sure it was the same people and the same story.", "media": null, "score": 90, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "comment_count": 9, "over_18": true}, "34": {"id": "1792bz5", "locked": false, "subreddit": "morbidhistory", "stickied": false, "category": "Crime", "author": "HistoryTodaymagazine", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1697855740.9189484, "created_utc": 1697449959.0, "url": "https://www.historytoday.com/archive/head-head/four-historians-tell-us-ghost-story", "title": "Four Historians Tell Us a Ghost Story", "permalink": "/r/MorbidHistory/comments/1792bz5/four_historians_tell_us_a_ghost_story/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comment_count": 0, "over_18": false}, "35": {"id": "1785vmx", "locked": false, "subreddit": "crimescene", "stickied": false, "category": "Crime", "author": "vaughndag", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1697855741.1695964, "created_utc": 1697338327.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1785vmx", "title": "Young Couple Cannot Run From Trouble", "permalink": "/r/CrimeScene/comments/1785vmx/young_couple_cannot_run_from_trouble/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 1140, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comment_count": 49, "over_18": true}, "36": {"id": "178307s", "locked": false, "subreddit": "truecreepy", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "AccomplishedWaltz609", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1697855741.34115, "created_utc": 1697329117.0, "url": "https://youtu.be/jXyaj4KjwnI?si=QkXm8IWi-c8Le0pc", "title": "Reddits Darkest Posts", "permalink": "/r/truecreepy/comments/178307s/reddits_darkest_posts/", "selftext": "", "media": {"type": "youtube.com", "oembed": {"provider_url": "https://www.youtube.com/", "version": "1.0", "title": "Reddits Darkest Posts", "type": "video", "thumbnail_width": 480, "height": 200, "width": 356, "html": "<iframe width=\"356\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jXyaj4KjwnI?feature=oembed&enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen title=\"Reddits Darkest Posts\"></iframe>", "author_name": "CJF", "provider_name": "YouTube", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jXyaj4KjwnI/hqdefault.jpg", "thumbnail_height": 360, "author_url": "https://www.youtube.com/@CJF0"}}, "score": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.61, "comment_count": 0, "over_18": false}, "37": {"id": "17b2e0m", "locked": false, "subreddit": "threekings", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "aceofhearties", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1697855741.5003421, "created_utc": 1697665770.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/threekings/comments/17b2e0m/urgent_about_tominos_hell/", "title": "(URGENT) About Tomino\u2019s Hell", "permalink": "/r/threekings/comments/17b2e0m/urgent_about_tominos_hell/", "selftext": "I think I\u2019m being paranoid but I just need reassurance I\u2019m fine.

Efforts are underway to identify all of the nearly 10,000 human remains (including bones, fragments, body parts, etc.) collected from Fox Hollow Farm. In addition, the lab has also identified seven other full DNA profiles that don't yet have a match, and continue to encourage relatives with missing loved ones to submit their DNA for comparisons. \nSources\nVideo Update\nWTHR Article\nCharlie Project", "media": null, "score": 1698, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comment_count": 100, "over_18": false}, "51": {"id": "17bmy1j", "locked": false, "subreddit": "morbidreality", "stickied": false, "category": "Crime", "author": "KingOfJuiceBoxes", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1697855752.7838252, "created_utc": 1697732222.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/17bmy1j", "title": "Dorothea Lange photographs.", "permalink": "/r/MorbidReality/comments/17bmy1j/dorothea_lange_photographs/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 2032, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comment_count": 107, "over_18": true}, "52": {"id": "17c133n", "locked": false, "subreddit": "urbanmyths", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Key-Honey-6195", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1697855753.1171575, "created_utc": 1697770539.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UrbanMyths/comments/17c133n/unearthly_encounters_in_urban_legends_toronto/", "title": "Unearthly Encounters in Urban Legends: Toronto, Tokyo, and London's Secrets", "permalink": "/r/UrbanMyths/comments/17c133n/unearthly_encounters_in_urban_legends_toronto/", "selftext": "I've discovered some mind-boggling urban legends involving mysterious creatures in the depths of urban cities:\n\nToronto's Sewer Encounter: In 1979, an unusual creature was reported in Toronto's sewer system.\nTokyo's Giant Spiders: Strange accounts of enormous spiders in Tokyo's forgotten sewers.\nLondon Subway Cannibal Rumors: Eerie rumors surrounding London's abandoned subway tunnels.\n\nI've compiled these stories into a video, shedding light on these urban legends that blur the line between fact and fiction.

Because of this I don\u2019t go on walks alone or even with friends unless it\u2019s in a very public place. But even then I am paranoid\u2026\nWith that being said, my friends family had just moved to a new town 15 minutes from where I lived. It was a complete ghost town, with one tiny grocery store, a post office, and a school. This down was so secluded and quite I rarely ever saw cars drive by. One night, as we were unpacking boxes we heard a knock at the door. It was a big tall man with a shotgun in his hands. Being from Oklahoma this could mean you\u2019re either meeting your hick new neighbor, or it\u2019s actually someone wanting to harm us. Turns out it was just a hick neighbor coming to introduce himself. He told my friends mom about the lack of police, and how everyone tends to carry their own guns in order to protect themselves, because the police were usually no help and 15 minutes away. He also talked about how these areas can be dangerous and that my friends mom should keep a gun with her. \nAt this time I was 13 years old, and knowing this information, you would think I would simply stay my ass inside and not wonder the streets of this dangerous hillbilly ghost town, but I did. There was no service, no cable, and nothing to do but go outside. We would walk to the store and get snacks, walk to the school and play on the playground. Majority of the time we wouldn\u2019t see a single car or person but the same clerk in the grocery story on every walk we took.\nThere was a day my dad had brought me to her house, and right off the bat we walked to the park. That day I was sick to my stomach, but was so eager to go see my friend I went anyways. I had a terrible feeling, and now that I\u2019m older and have experienced bad anxiety I can now say that day I was experiencing some pretty bad anxiety, and I didn\u2019t know why I felt this way. When we got there we actually ended up hanging out with an old friend who had transferred to this school a year prior. After he left, we sat on the bench for what felt like ages taking selfie\u2019s and talking, when all of a sudden the stereotypical creepy van pulls up to the park. \nNow my friend was and still is way braver than I was and will ever be, and she was always the dare devil one in our friendship. But for some reason, around this time I just assumed it was a family coming to play, and my anxiety was gone. But my friend was scared. She immediately had a bad feeling when the van pulled up, and I could tell she was ready to leave. But we decided to stay and see who it was before we just ran off. Of course, like something out of a movie came out two big men literally barreling over to where we were. We immediately started to walk away, and they tried to follow and grab us. At this point we began to run. They got back into the van and followed us. I have no idea how but they didn\u2019t catch up to us, but we ran as fast as we would up the road and straight to the grocery store. I was so horrified when we got inside I couldn\u2019t even speak. That sick feeling I felt on the way to my friends house made complete sense. My mom grew up watching true crime so I was always really scared to walk around, but even with that fear I never thought it would happen to me. The van was parked up front but eventually drove away. \nWe walked home with no way to call anyone, thinking they could be waiting for us around every corner with absolutely no one around. It was the scariest day of my life. I didn\u2019t tell anyone for years, which was stupid of me, but at 13 years old I didn\u2019t know what to do. I always wonder what would have happened if they captured me and my friend, where we would have gone, and what would have happened to us.", "media": null, "score": 82, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "comment_count": 3, "over_18": true}, "55": {"id": "17a8zjz", "locked": false, "subreddit": "morbidhistory", "stickied": false, "category": "Crime", "author": "GeneralDavis87", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1697855753.888961, "created_utc": 1697577456.0, "url": "https://youtu.be/YTqI0FFpxK4?si=wfcWcSh37g28i7yd", "title": "US Navy ships LSM(R) 199 and 194 launch rockets at Okinawa", "permalink": "/r/MorbidHistory/comments/17a8zjz/us_navy_ships_lsmr_199_and_194_launch_rockets_at/", "selftext": "", "media": {"type": "youtube.com", "oembed": {"provider_url": "https://www.youtube.com/", "version": "1.0", "title": "US Navy ships LSM(R) 199 and 194 launch rockets at Okinawa", "type": "video", "thumbnail_width": 480, "height": 200, "width": 356, "html": "<iframe width=\"356\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YTqI0FFpxK4?feature=oembed&enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen title=\"US Navy ships LSM(R) 199 and 194 launch rockets at Okinawa\"></iframe>", "author_name": "Future of Tomorrow", "provider_name": "YouTube", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YTqI0FFpxK4/hqdefault.jpg", "thumbnail_height": 360, "author_url": "https://www.youtube.com/@futureoftomorrow4354"}}, "score": 4, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comment_count": 0, "over_18": false}, "56": {"id": "17a1f3w", "locked": false, "subreddit": "crimescene", "stickied": false, "category": "Crime", "author": "vaughndag", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1697855754.1453743, "created_utc": 1697557660.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/17a1f3w", "title": "Key Corruption Witness and Three Others Discovered in Hotel Room", "permalink": "/r/CrimeScene/comments/17a1f3w/key_corruption_witness_and_three_others/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 887, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comment_count": 36, "over_18": true}, "57": {"id": "17crb6t", "locked": false, "subreddit": "truecreepy", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "BehemothslayerJon", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1697855754.3399022, "created_utc": 1697852380.0, "url": "https://youtu.be/WBPF8luvp68", "title": "Two Tiktok Users' Dark Encounter", "permalink": "/r/truecreepy/comments/17crb6t/two_tiktok_users_dark_encounter/", "selftext": "", "media": {"type": "youtube.com", "oembed": {"provider_url": "https://www.youtube.com/", "version": "1.0", "title": "What Did They Saw On The Rooftop?

There is something on my mind that I want to put out into the world because I believe people fall prey to this situation because there are not enough things to do in the world, I don't want this to happen to someone else since I have found out a lot more about this situation than I would have liked to. He is trying to kill me with psychology and any means necessary. I know that sounds crazy, but I am desperate to get this out in the light so that the darkness has no power We as human beings are always searching for something more some type of answer to our problems or a purpose. Well, that is just one house I have uncovered. One of the members his name is Chris Hall. He has a voice changer and it's pretty realistic. It does play tricks on your mind which makes me think it is not of this dimension. Well, He is a Sadist and I hate to write about people, but he keeps on hurting me over and over again. I mean it's been 8 years now that he has been stalking me waiting for my kids to return home. All I can do is cling to God now and forever and Jesus as well. I believe he has fabricated the story of the people of the group that he is supposedly with. I honestly don't even think he's in this group, but he kept bringing it up a lot and it got in my head. He kept saying I was going to jail and when he says stuff like that it makes me feel queasy. Because he knows how to manipulate very well, he has been taping me but now he lost the tapes they just aren't there anymore because if he played them for the world, it would be really not good because those kinds of tapes shouldn\u2019t just be used for setting people up. So, I did the only thing I could think of doing. Hoped in my soul and prayed that the tapes would vanish so that the field would be fair. I feel like once he runs his mouth to the occult I will be in worse shape because he has a plan, and I just am armored with the truth. Which always works for me. Plus, everybody knows I don't just run my mouth like that if they knew me well. It got so bad that he would talk to me in my sleep and get information that way. I dropped my classes to get a handle on myself and had to go to psych because I got tag teamed and I didn't want to lose my should to either him or he was making it up as he went on. I believe the group was there for a little while, but I was really turned around by that time. This has been happening for about 3-5 years off and on. He kept telling me he would take me to a rally and burn me up and drag me there. I mean some seriously sick shit. All he is interested in is my kids and he brings it up all the time. He told me he psych's the group of ppl he is with to make them forget that he is a child molester. I won't be dying by your hand at all. I have God on my side and Jesus as well. I do believe in some other gods, but I am working on easing god into the situation, or maybe one god can do it all. Who knows all I know is I don't need to die because someone wants me to or is planning for that to happen. He has sadistic toys he uses and it's the way he gets control of everyone around him. He also is a master manipulator. But the kid thing is going to come out because he is trying to stick that to me, and I am appalled very sick deep down in my stomach just yuck. I am trying to forgive but he just keeps trying to get rid of me in any way he knows how. I just really wish he hadn't started a war with his rumor mill. That really embarrassed me and I don't really like being embarrassed at all.

Here's a link to the previous post where I dug into the Gimbal video.\nTo be clear \u2013 at this point in time it is not publicly known which (combination) of the Four Viable Explanations best describes the reality of the phenomenon. Furthermore, the point of this post is not to definitively prove any one explanation over another, instead it is to establish a common framework of analysis and pose a set of questions that might enable a more nuanced and structured discourse going forward.\nThe subject of this post is the UAP Disclosure Act of 2023:\n\nLink to full document (PDF) here. \nLink to my summary here.\n\nBackground\n\nOn July 13, 2023 \u2013 the UAP Disclosure Act of 2023 (UAPDA) was submitted as an amendment to the National Defense Authorisation Act FY24\nThe UAPDA is supported by a bipartisan group of senior Senators, spearheaded by\u00a0Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer\u00a0and Senator Mike Rounds (R-SD)\nThe overall stated intentions of the UAPDA are to centralise and declassify information related to Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP), increase public transparency around the government's knowledge of UAP, and further open avenues for scientific research on the topic\nThe legislation states it is necessary \"because credible evidence and testimony indicates that Federal Government unidentified anomalous phenomena records exist that have not been declassified\"\nA full summary of the key takeaways and definitions in the UAPDA can be found here. I would highly recommend checking this out before reading any further.\nOne of the most important things to note is this: the UAPDA takes specific care to concretely define what the term UAP means. The definition used throughout the text specifically distinguishes UAP from prosaic objects, as well as 'temporarily non-attributed objects'. That is to say \u2013 any reference to a UAP, or UAP-related record, is referring to the class of objects that are designated as such only when the available data explicitly rules out any other potential explanation involving \"current physics\".\n\nFramework Analysis:\nLet's attempt to parse the UAPDA through each lens of the 4 viable explanations framework individually, to present a case for each potential claim on its own. In so doing, I hope to illuminate a set of questions that we (as relatively uninformed armchair analysts) can use to better frame the discussions going forward.\nSystematic Error:\n\nSystem anomalies and trained human observer errors have led to such a large volume of related records that a substantial number of DoD/Intelligence Community members have been sufficiently motivated to escalate the issue to authorities such as the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (and others). These records are all, in fact, related to prosaic objects / phenomena / sensor errors, not UAP.\nCredible members of the DoD/Intelligence Community have come to the conclusion that there are long-standing UAP Crash Retrieval/Reverse Engineering programs operating without any legislative oversight. Their conviction in this belief is so high, they have decided to escalate this issue to their superiors and the appropriate authorities. This belief could be characterised as some sort of collective delusion and/or sustained psychotic episode.\n\nProponents of this explanation should ask themselves the following:\n\nWhy does the UAPDA define and use extremely specific language, such as \"Non-Human Intelligence\", or \"technologies of unknown origin\"?\nWhy does the UAPDA specifically define UAP so as to distinguish it from objects with prosaic attribution, as well as 'temporarily non-attributed objects'?\nWhat credible testimony/evidence have the sponsors of this legislation been privy to that convinces them that UAP are more than just systematic errors?\nHow can we investigate this further to establish if this is all a collective delusion?\n\n\nSystematic Deception:\n\nA co-ordinated group of government insiders are collectively engaging in a campaign to convince the broader public that UAP represent a Non-Human Intelligence-related phenomenon\n\nProponents of this explanation should ask themselves the following:\n\nWhat would the motivations of such a campaign be?\nHow long has this campaign been going on?\nWho is in on it? Members of the IC? Members of the US Senate/Congress?\nWhat steps should/could we take to investigate this further?\nHow far will this deception go?\n\n\nReal Human Secret Technology:\n\nA co-ordinated group of government insiders are leveraging Systematic Deception (see above) to cover up the existence of Real Human Secret Technology\nOr, a variety of members of the IC and legislative branch have become aware of highly advanced Real Human Secret Technology programs that have flouted proper oversight procedures, and are vying to rectify this without divulging the specifics of said programs. A decision has been made to utilise UAP/NHI as a smokescreen.\n\nProponents of this explanation should ask themselves the following:\n\nWhy would the UAPDA take such specific care to distinguish between UAP and any known prosaic (even highly advanced) technology platforms? How can we square this with the claims presented above?\nWhy would the UAPDA overtly reference Non-Human Intelligence, if this is simply about gaining oversight over secret human programs?\nWhy would a cover-up make use of the UFO/NHI topic as a smokescreen? Surely this raises more attention than necessary?\nWhy would the US Government feel the need to establish 'eminent domain' over highly advanced technology platforms that they already own?\n\n\nReal Non-Human Technology:\n\nThe language in the legislation can be taken at face value, insofar as the Senators who drafted it have been credibly briefed on the existence of UAP-related records that have been improperly classified and/or escaped mandatory declassification protocols.\nFurthermore, they have reason to believe in the existence of long-standing UAP crash retrieval & reverse engineering program(s) that may be in the possession of exotic technologies & materials.\n\nProponents of this explanation should ask themselves the following:\n\nWhy now?\nWhat's next?\nHow can we ensure greater transparency going forward?\n\n\u200b\nClosing remarks\nWhile the UAPDA has yet to be finalised and entered into law as part of the FY24 NDAA, the very act of its creation is at a minimum...eyebrow-raising. The political weight of the sponsors behind it are also noteworthy (e.g. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer).\nIn the course of this post, I have tried to lay out a few different ways to parse it based on the Four Viable Explanations framework. As you may have noticed, the quadrants (while collectively exhaustive) are not mutually-exclusive. That means the true explanation could (and realistically does) lie in a combination of the claims I've presented above.\nWhile it's crucial to approach this topic with a critical mind, it's equally important to remain open to all possibilities. As the discourse on UAPs continues to evolve, one can only hope for more transparency, clarity, and understanding. Whichever explanation resonates most with you, remember that the goal is to foster informed and constructive discussions.

She was found by her mother, Betty Scalf, who had been babysitting Theresa's eight-year-old son and grew concerned when hrr daughter didn\u2019t stop by to see him on her way to work. Theresa's throat had been cut and she had defensive wounds on her hands; although none of the online references I\u2019ve found state outright that she was sexually assaulted, police did say the crime had been sexually motivated. Notably, the perpetrator had left blood evidence at the scene, but even though the evidence was eventually sent for DNA testing and a profile uploaded to CODIS no match was made. With little other evidence pointing to a potential suspect the case went cold.\nIn 2022 the Polk County Sheriff's Office hired Othram to create a new DNA profile and conduct forensic genealogical research, which led them through a distant cousin to 33-year-old Donald Douglas of Lakeland. Douglas was interviewed after the attack but there was no evidence linking him with the murder until now; he died in 2008 of natural causes, and had never been arrested or charged with any sort of crime. His identity as the prime suspect was confirmed through a match with his son, who voluntarily cooperated with the investigation and was shocked by the results.\nThe Scalf family welcomed the news. Her mother was quoted by WFLA as saying, \"I\u2019m 84 years old. I lived to see this done.

My girlfriend and I were both 21 years old. We were out on a drive up hwy 1 past davenport CA. We spent the day at the beach and driving up and down some back roads in my jeep. It started to get late so we decided to call it a day and head home. If your not familare with Ca. Hwy 1, some stretches of the highway are on cliffs high up above the ocean. There are alot of turnouts along the highway and people will park in them to watch the sunset. We were on a stretch of the hwy pretty far between any houses or buisness and  I drove past this particularly sweet turnout that almost ALWAYS has a car parked in it during sunset time. For once it was empty. Since it was around sunset time, I did a U-Turn and backed into the spot.\nThe spot is small, there is a huge dirt mound on side and a steep cliff face with a trail going up about 60ft on the other side. The gap inbetween the two sides was like 16 ft. The mound was on the passenger side and the cliff face was on the drivers side. And we were pretty close to the edge, it wasnt an abrudt edge though, there was a medium size dirt mound so cars wont just roll off the cliff. So anyways, I was pretty stoked. So we sat there in the back of my jeep facing out over the ocean watching the sky turn red. It was nice. \nAbout 25 minutes in, my hopped  out and to get her water from the front of the car. She came back and then right after she sits down this black bmw suv pulled up. Like I said there was only room for 1 car at this tight spot. You theoretically could park two, but you would have to park directly park infront of my car and block me in. And that's exactly what this guy did. I was pretty annoyed awhen he pulled up because I think that's rude to pull up on someone in such a small spot and then block them in. My gf said \"wtf?\" \"I know right what a rudeass\" I said back. Then she said \"no I mean I saw that car drive past when I was getting my water and the guy looked at me, so it's weird that he turned around and parked there\". Which was strange and made me more annoyed, but it was a nice evening so were like whatever and we brushed it off,  they'll probably leave in a couple of minutes anyways. So we kept enjoying the sunset.\n10 minutes pass and then the driver steps out of the car. He was this yuppie looking kind of guy probably in his late 40's or early 50's. About 6'3\". He was wearing a button up shirt and tie. He looks around and slowly walks up to the back of my car (he's on the passenger side) and says hello to my girlfriend and I, we say Hi back. There's a pause and he looks over the edge and says \"thats a long ways down\" then he looks back at us with a creepy half smile. So I'm already a little bit weirded out so I just say \"yeaaaaah it sure is\" with a forced a laugh at the end. He then asks \"do you guys have any cigarettes? Maybe something healthy like American spirits?\" (Lol \"something healthy\") BUT I coincidentally did have some American spirits cigarettes. They were on my dashboard in the front so he definitely saw them which made the way he asked seem kind of weird to me. So I gave him one and he goes \"ahhh yes thank you\" he went back to his car and started to rummaged through the back. My girlfriend and I were both looking at eachother, I say \"isn't this kind of weird?\" She goes \"yeah, why cliff comment?\". \nThe guy comes back after a couple of minutes with a fold out chair and a small duffle bag. He puts the duffle on the ground and folds out his chair and sits right next to us he was about 3 ft away from us, he didn't have the cigarette I gave him anymore I dont think he even smoked it. He randomly starts asking us questions. Like; \"are you guys homeless?\" And I go \"uh no, were not homeless\" I throw in a short laugh at the end because I just was trying to play it cool and not seem weirded out. He then asks \"are you two from around here?\" I go \"yeah we live in the mountains by hwy 17\" he replies \"that's pretty far from here isn't it?\" I go \"its like 30-45 minutes, so not too far\". The sun was starting to get lower in the sky and it started to get dimmer out. Mr. American spirit guy reaches in the duffle bag and pulls out some glasses and a huge handle of vodka??? \"Here do you guys want some?\" I say \"no we're good\" then he says \"come on, lets relax a little\" then I say \"nah I need to drive\". \"Suit yourself\" he says and he pours himself a fat glass and downs it immediately after. My girlfriend and I threw glances at eachother that communicated \"this is weird\". \nWe sit there in awkward silence for about 10 minutes, there was some kind of weird tension in the air. Then out of no where he asks \"so does anyone know your out here?\" Uhhh red flag??? Also at this point I was starting to get annoyed because he was ruining the evening with his creepyness and questions. so I was kind of short with him and said \"yeah most likely\". He just nodded and didn't say anything. It was just turning into a weird ass interaction and I was getting such a weird feeling in my gut about this whole situation. I eventually 'asked' my girlfriend \"well should we wrap it up?\" She immediately said yes. So I stood up and my gf crawled in over through the back seat into the front passenger. I close the rear door and immediately the dude snaps his head towards me in am almost comically creepy way and deadass says \"how are you going to get out if I'm blocking you in like this?\" Im thinking \"wtf is this dude on?\" But realized he had a good point. But I tried to act chill and said \"I think I got it\" I got inside my jeep, locked the doors and turned it on. My girlfriend said she saw him start rummage thru his duffle bag again. I started to get an adrenaline rush at this point and shit started to move fast, not even paying attention to the dude I engaged the 4wd, and there was just enough space between his car and the cliff face for me to angle my driver side up the cliff face it tilted my jeep at a sharp 45 degree angle, which was sketchy because  I pinned the gas when I looked in my mirror and saw the guy quickly walking around to my side. I was barely able to get past his car without hitting it or flipping my jeep onto it, but once I did I peeled out of there. \nMy girlfriend and I were like \"holy shit!\" we looked back at the guy as we drove away and he was standing there with a blank expression on his face and he was holding something long in his right hand close to his side, I dont know what it was. He just stood there looking at us for a seccond then he started to quickly pack up his things. I had to pull over real quick to put my jeep back into 2wd before going faster down the road, and we saw the guy pull out and drive away in the opposite direction. We never saw him again after that.

Anyways, the security guard saw this shadow move in the camera as the nurse went in there, as she told the patient if anything is bugging her she can always tell it to go away.

Brittanee Drexel was another one of these top cases for me for many years and last year her case was finally solved after 13 years. I can only hope for the same for Ali.   \nAli Lowitzer was 16 years old living in Spring, Texas with her mom Joanne. On April 26th, 2010, Ali told her mother she was going to walk to Burger Barn, the restaurant she worked at, to pick up her paycheck and possibly pick up a shift. When Ali got off the bus that afternoon, several students on the bus said she was walking in the direction of the Burger Barn.  \nWhen Joanne returned home that evening, Ali wasn't there and she assumed she had been able to pick up a shift, however after all her calls to her daughter later in the evening went unanswered, Joanne drove down to Burger Barn to see the restaurant was closed without Ali in sight. It was later discovered that Ali had never shown up to work that day.   \nAt first, Ali was classified as a runaway, but her mother insisted she wasn't due Ali leaving behind everything she would've needed if she was running away such as her contact lenses, her phone charger, money, plus a paycheck she had never picked up. When investigators looked into Ali's email and Facebook accounts, they noticed nothing suspicious. Her cell phone, which she frequently used and would send 1000s of text messages a month, also did not provide much insight. There weren't any alarming texts and she didn't appear to be talking to anyone suspicious.   \nBurger Barn was about a quarter mile walk from Ali's house. What could have happened in that short amount of time? In broad daylight? There have barely been any leads in Ali's case except for one that lead to an Ohio brothel, but was later ruled out.

Today I'm a 26 (F), and I still get goose bumps, and it's even creepier with my adult eyes.\nIn fact, to be more precise, this event took place over a period of more than 6 months.\nTo put it in context, it all started when I was about 14. At the time, I was attending a private secondary school in the south of France, and I used to go to my grandmother's every evening, to wait for my mother to get off work and pick me up.\nMy grandmother, who was retired, would wait for me in her car when I got out of school, but the more time passed, the more I wanted to be independent. So I asked her if I could take the bus home, and she agreed. I liked to put my headphones on and take advantage of the long journey to listen to my favorite music and be in my own bubble. \nThe nearest bus stop to her house was about ten minutes away on foot, because, by bad coincidence, the one opposite the dead end she is living in had been condemned for lack of use. But that didn't bother me, as I'm more of a stroller by nature. So I started taking the same bus, every day, at roughly the same time (although this could vary, I didn't have classes on Wednesday afternoons, for example).\nWhen I was 14, I was really childlike. When I say childlike, I mean, I've always had a childish face, but this time it really showed. I didn't have a \"woman's\" shape, I always had cute stuffed animals hanging on my bag, well, I guess you can imagine. \nAnd then, I first noticed this guy on the bus, must have been in September-October.  He must have been in his forties, not very tall, and bald. Why did I notice him, you might ask ? Well, because he was staring at me. I even had the feeling that he wasn't blinking. He was giving me smiles that didn't inspire confidence, but it was completely instinctive: I'd never been confronted with the reality of the world, I was still very naive, but I knew something wasn't right.\nI didn't say anything.I just decided to \"run away\" from the situation that didn't make me feel comfortable, by looking in another direction, and that was that. That was just the beginning of something I would remember forever.\nThis man took the same bus as me, every day, at the same time, even when my schedule changed.\nTo this day, I have still no idea how he could have got these informations: was he watching me? Did he live around the school? He was always staring at me with those strange smiles, never letting up, but never talking to me. I'd get off the bus at my stop, he'd stay on, and then the cycle would start all over again the next day. I was so terrified of this situation that I didn't dare telling anyone: I was afraid they wouldn't believe me, and also that I wouldn't be allowed out of the house afterwards.\nAnd then one day (it was around May-June, at the end of the school year), I'd had enough: I got off at a stop halfway through the journey, and hid (naively) behind a tree to try and lose him. I'd had enough of these persistent stares... Except that the guy also got off. And he started looking for me. There was nobody around, and that's when I realized I wasn't safe. The guy was calling me \"Where are you, sweetheart? Come on, let's have a chat!\" I was, so to speak, sweating and unable to move from my tree. Of course, he eventually found me.\"You're really pretty, you know that? I'd love to have a chat, get to know you...\"Frankly, I didn't want to get to know him at all, he terrified me, and I wanted to go home. I tried to make him understand that he was freaking me out and that I wanted him to leave me alone. I asked him what he wanted, and he kept saying the same thing over and over, \"just to get to know each other\"...\nThe next bus arrived and I took the opportunity to run on to it, except that he did too.\nHe sat down, stopped talking and stared at me, smiling. I was in an internal panic, my thoughts were going in all directions and I didn't know what to do. I made the worst decision of all, getting off at my usual stop and going back to my grandma's anyway, thinking he'd do as usual and stay on the bus. Except that this time, he got off at the same time as me. The stop was in a very lightly trafficked area, and was lined with little dirt paths that served as shortcuts to parallel thoroughfares. I told myself that he was going to kidnap me, that he was going to take me down a small path and that I would never be able to go home again. But I didn't want him to notice my fear, as it seemed to \"fuel\" him in a kind of domineering pleasure. So he started asking me to \"get to know each other\" again, while following me. I picked up the pace, but he kept lining up with me : he wouldn't let go.\nEventually I reached my grandmother's dead end, and finally saw the light at the end of the tunnel. I ran up to her house, and she was standing in the doorway reading a book. She saw me coming, red-faced, still shaking with panic, with the bald guy staring at us from behind the gate. She saw my face, and I didn't need to talk to her : she yelled that she was going to call the cops if he didn't get out of there fast. He turned around and left the dead end.\nAfter that, my grandmother categorically refused to let me back on the bus. Until my senior year, she picked me up in front of the school gate every day .I never saw that man again. When I think that this guy, this ADULT, followed a 14-year-old girl home... That he became fixated on me, and that this happened EVERY day... Who knows how far it could have gone? Maybe that's what's most worrying about all this. To this man : let's not meet again, and I hope that he never meets a young girl again aswell.\nToday, I no longer take public transport, unless I'm accompanied, because it terrifies me.", "media": null, "score": 76, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comment_count": 6, "over_18": true}, "89": {"id": "178zg7i", "locked": false, "subreddit": "morbidhistory", "stickied": false, "category": "Crime", "author": "GeneralDavis87", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1697855781.1578844, "created_utc": 1697437278.0, "url": "https://youtu.be/dRXxCFrG_yI?si=QgDZR4iL6DlnfFSX", "title": "Japanese Relocation Documentary (1942)", "permalink": "/r/MorbidHistory/comments/178zg7i/japanese_relocation_documentary_1942/", "selftext": "", "media": {"type": "youtube.com", "oembed": {"provider_url": "https://www.youtube.com/", "version": "1.0", "title": "Japanese Relocation Documentary (1942)", "type": "video", "thumbnail_width": 480, "height": 200, "width": 356, "html": "<iframe width=\"356\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dRXxCFrG_yI?feature=oembed&enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen title=\"Japanese Relocation Documentary (1942)\"></iframe>", "author_name": "Marvelous Movies", "provider_name": "YouTube", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dRXxCFrG_yI/hqdefault.jpg", "thumbnail_height": 360, "author_url": "https://www.youtube.com/@Marvelous_Movies"}}, "score": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "comment_count": 0, "over_18": false}, "90": {"id": "179bxcq", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ghosts", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "wholelottalove84", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1697855782.5611966, "created_utc": 1697478301.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/vc6ic5adqlub1.png", "title": "Shame you can't charge them rent, amirite?", "permalink": "/r/Ghosts/comments/179bxcq/shame_you_cant_charge_them_rent_amirite/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 188, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "comment_count": 25, "over_18": false}, "91": {"id": "17bruy9", "locked": false, "subreddit": "glitchinthematrix", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "cordless-lawn-mower", "link_flair_text": "Glitch Pic", "time": 1697855782.849739, "created_utc": 1697745016.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/k2180dxkr7vb1.jpg", "title": "Rollin x 5", "permalink": "/r/GlitchInTheMatrix/comments/17bruy9/rollin_x_5/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 21, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "comment_count": 8, "over_18": false}, "92": {"id": "1785kln", "locked": false, "subreddit": "bigfoot", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "somethinglikethat3", "link_flair_text": "wholesome", "time": 1697855783.728659, "created_utc": 1697337281.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/hctw7r763aub1.jpg", "title": "Annual Bigfoot pumpkin 4 years strong \ud83d\udda4see you guys next year", "permalink": "/r/bigfoot/comments/1785kln/annual_bigfoot_pumpkin_4_years_strong_see_you/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 116, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comment_count": 12, "over_18": false}, "93": {"id": "17biby5", "locked": false, "subreddit": "cryptozoology", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "EnvironmentalCook343", "link_flair_text": "Lore ", "time": 1697855784.3817043, "created_utc": 1697719683.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/i7pboza8o5vb1.jpg", "title": "Meme I stole", "permalink": "/r/Cryptozoology/comments/17biby5/meme_i_stole/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 109, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "comment_count": 8, "over_18": false}, "94": {"id": "17a0vyc", "locked": false, "subreddit": "cryptids", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "IvanGrodzenskyUA", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1697855785.230141, "created_utc": 1697556249.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/sa024h456sub1.jpg", "title": "Dover demon.
