Photo, source, source\nThis bizarre creature immediately raised eyebrows. It appears to be an incirrate octopod, a type of cephalopod which includes regular octopuses and is distinguished from cirrate octopods by its lack of fingerlike cirri and fins. However, at the striking depth of 4.3 kilometers (2.6 miles), this individual was found much deeper than any incirrate octopod had ever before been seen. Octopuses are typically found in much shallower waters.\nAnother mystery is the creature's short arms, and the single row of suckers on its arms. Octopuses use their long arms to grab food. Although not seen, scientists have speculated that this organism instead reorients its body underneath falling food to eat; its mouth is located on its underside. Unlike most octopuses, this creature has just one and not two rows of suckers on its arms. Source\nSeven years later, the species still has no name, though it's not entirely certain that this represents a new species. Similarly, the genus has not been identified, and it's unclear whether the creature belongs to an existing genus or a new one. Social media at the time named the creature \"Casper\", after Casper the Friendly Ghost. Scientists reviewing archived deep-sea footage found dozens more sightings of these octopods, possibly belonging to two different species.\nAnother ghostly white octopus spotted near Antarctica\nIn 2010, the British submarine ROV Isis was conducting a survey of biological communities around hydrothermal vents off the coast of Antarctica when it spotted a different sort of pale, ghostlike octopus, attracted by the light of the submarine. Photo, source, source\nThis eerie creature was discovered at a depth of 2.4 kilometers (1.5 miles). It was too fast for the submarine to collect a sample. The creature remains unidentified and unclassified today. I can't find as much information about this one. It seems to resemble Vulcanoctopus hydrothermalis, which as the name suggests is a species of deep-sea octopus found near hydrothermal vents in the Pacific, but the creature has not been conclusively identified as this species. Although not seen, it has been speculated that this octopus preys on yeti crabs, another mysterious, ghoulish white creature that has only been found near hydrothermal vents.

I decided to leave after my health started to get worse physically and I was diagnosed with panic disorder and severe anxiety after the situation that I'm about to tell you. This changed the way that I developed friendships after that job; that's for certain.\nSo, I started this job on April Fools day of 2018 (which was odd to me) and I had no kind of high expectation of the job. All I wanted was to do my job, get paid, and go home as I had two children at home and many things that I could work on there. The job wasn't hard and it made pretty good money for all duties considered so, I really couldn't complain. I worked second shift for about 5 months and I went to dayshift.\nWhile working on second shift, I kept to myself mostly until, one day, I met someone from one of the lines after we struck up a conversation about gaming. For the sake of anonymity, we'll name him JF. Well JF was a pretty good guy and we had a lot of things in common. I went home that night and he popped up as a suggested friend on Facebook (again, another oddity) so, I decided to add him. When I did, we started talking more at work until he suggested that we should hang out so, we did hang out. Pretty frequently.\nWe were friends for a month at this point and one day, he decided that he was going to introduce me to his partner. She seemed decent at first: super nice, didn't seem to be a judgmental type so, I was cool with her. From then on, I would hang out with him when my kids were spending time with my mother. One time, we were talking at a restaurant and he started to vent to me. \"Dude, she's such a bitch sometimes. The other day, I forgot to take the trash out and she threatened to stab me if I didn't. I've never been in a relationship where someone's threatened me but, she's got good intentions, dude.\" When he said that to me, I was concerned but, of course, we had only been friends for a month so, I thought that maybe, he was being morbid jokingly so, I chuckled at him. He gave me a pretty serious look and said, \"I'm not joking. She really did.\" That concerned me.\nFast forward about 8 months: They're still together and we all hang out pretty regularly forgetting the things he told me then. One day, we were all talking and he seemed a little off that day so, I asked him what was wrong in front of her. He flashed a smirk and said, \"Nothing, dude. I'm just a little tired.\" He didn't have his eyes on me though. He had them on her when I asked that. When we went to work the next day, I asked him again. \"Do you promise to keep this between us?\" Of course, I agreed. He said that he was breaking up with her and she went a little crazy. He said that she grabbed her gun and pointed it at him and said, \"If I can't have you then, no one will.\" He said that he diffused the situation and is trying to look for a way out. Not really knowing what to say, I just said, \"You'll figure it out, man. If you need somewhere to go then, you can come stay with me until you get her out of the house.\" \nFast forward to another year: he finally decided to leave her. When he did, she flipped out again. This time, he told her over text. She said that she was going to find him and kill him and he was actually out of work that day with a vacation day. He sent me a text that said, \"Hey, let me know if she comes over to work looking for me.\" That struck me as odd because, I had no idea of the situation that was unfolding. She actually did come to our job and she asked me where he was and I said, \"I have no idea. I thought he was with you and you guys went out of town or something.\" All she did was roll up her window and drive off. I called him and told him that she came by and he called the police about it. They had found her up the road with a loaded gun in the car.\nTwo months later: he decided to talk to her again and when he did, he had something to tell me. When he called me, he asked if I had seen her around and I hadn't. He said, \"I would take some vacation days if I were you.\" Dumbfounded, I asked him why. He said to me, \"Because, she's out of jail and her cousins are in town trying to find the people she has personal vendettas with. You're one of them.\" At that point, I was terrified. I grabbed my kids and went out of town. Took two weeks off of work. Come to find out, that next day, her and her cousins went to the next town over and shot 3 people in an apartment and killed them. I got the news about it the day after it happened. The reason why he knew they were coming after me is because, they made a Facebook Messenger group that he was included in and sent a list of names. Everyone regarded it as spam and decided to disregard the message but he knew what it was. 3 of the names on that list were the people that they shot. The fourth name on that list... was mine. After they found the evidence and he decided to go public about the group and screenshots that he had, they were all charged with first degree murder.\nFrom then on, I was very careful about who I would stick my neck out for because, even though, he knew the context of that list and her intentions, he decided to not inform anyone else on it. Needless to say, we aren't friends anymore and I dodged a bullet. Literally. Sorry for the long post. I felt like it needed context.

Despite decades of searching, the girls are yet to be found.", "permalink": "/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/16o69qc/in_1974_3_young_girls_disappeared_from_a_shopping/", "selftext": "In Fort Worth, Texas, a city near Dallas, lived 3 girls: Mary Rachel Trlica, Lisa Renee Wilson, and Julie Ann Moseley, aged 17, 14 and 9. Rachel and Renee were students at Southwest High School, and the two were close friends; Julie was the younger sister of Renee\u2019s boyfriend and neighbor Terry, which made them friends. Rachel lived close by Renee with her husband of 6 months, 23-year-old Tommy Trlica, as well as her 19-year-old sister Debra. All of the missing lived within a few blocks of each other.\nRenee\u2019s boyfriend had just given her a promise ring, and Rachel was eager to pick up Christmas presents for her very young stepson, who would be with her and Tommy for Christmas Eve. She initially asked her sister Debra to come with her, but she turned down the offer, saying she was tired from playing Canasta until 4 AM the night before.\nWith Debra opting to sleep in, Rachel called Renee, and the two made plans to go to the mall. When Rachel arrived to Renee\u2019s house, Julie asked to tag along, and the girls agreed as long as her mother said yes. Excited, Julie called her mother on the phone, and though she initially said no, Julie was persuasive, telling her mother she would have no one to play with otherwise. After much pleading, her mother finally agreed, telling the girl to be home by 6 PM. This was no problem, as Renee had plans to be at a party at 4 PM that day anyways.\nThe girls got inside Rachel\u2019s Oldsmobile and headed out, stopping by an Army Surplus store first to pick up some items Rachel had put on layaway. After that, they rode to the Seminary South Shopping Center, a mall in Fort Worth with an array of stores and plenty of shoppers. The girls parked on the \u201cSears\u201d upper-level parking lot and got out, never to see their families again.\u00a0\nAfter they got out of the car, the girls went inside to shop. Around 6 PM, the girls hadn\u2019t been home, so Rachel\u2019s family went to the mall to look for them. Though they looked through all the stores and paged Rachel repeatedly, they couldn\u2019t locate her. All they found was her car, still sitting in the Sears parking lot. It was full of presents, meaning the girls had definitely left the mall at some point. Unable to find their children, the involved families turned to the police.\nInitially, police considered the children to be runaways, not missing. This more optimistic outlook made a bit sense too: Debra, Rachel\u2019s older sister, had herself run away before. The day after the girls disappeared, a letter, ostensibly written by Rachel, arrived to Tommy confirming that the girls had gone to Houston temporarily. However, the families of the involved didn\u2019t believe the girls ran away, as the circumstances, and even the letter itself, were sketchy.\nTo start, the Arnolds (Rachel\u2019s family) figured, even if she ran away, she wouldn\u2019t take the 9-year-old Julie with her.\nFurthermore, they weren\u2019t sure the letter actually came from Rachel for a variety of reasons. For example, the signature at the bottom looked misspelled, as if she initially wrote \u201cRachee\u201d before chaning the last \u201ce\u201d to an \u201cl.\u201d The letter was also addressed to \u201cThomas,\u201d a name by which Rachel never called her husband. Finally, the zip code on the envelope \u2013 76083 \u2013 was blurred, and the final 3 was backwards. The letter\u2019s quick arrival was also a mystery. For all of these reasons, the families believed the letter was a fake.\nPolice weren\u2019t convinced the letter was real either. Over the years, the letter has been sent to the FBI alongside samples of Rachel\u2019s handwriting to compare, and the results came back inconclusive. One theory states that Rachel indeed wrote the letter, but only because she was forced to.\nThe zip code on the letter could be \u201c76088\u201d if one read the backwards 3 as a faded 8; otherwise, it was \u201c76083,\u201d with the backwards 3 likely coming from a hand-loaded stamp. Those zip codes, at the time, were for Weatherford and Throckmorton, Texas \u2013 neither of which was on the way to Houston.\nWith the girls missing and the letter no help, the families awaited their returns and did what they could to find them.\nOn New Years Eve, a girl called the Wilson home saying that she was a friend of Renee\u2019s, and that the girls would be arriving back to Fort Worth on a bus from Houston at 7:25 PM that day. The Wilsons quickly told the other families about it, and they all rushed down to the Greyhound bus station to see their girls. 7:25 came, as did a bus from Houston, but the girls weren\u2019t on it. By 8:30, most of the families went home. Renee\u2019s father Richard and Tommy stuck around until midnight before heading home to bring in the New Year without their girls.\nAftermath\nThe girl who called the Wilson household claiming to be a friend of Renee\u2019s was a fake, as none of Renee\u2019s friends recognized her name when asked by Renee\u2019s mom Judy. Unfortunately, she would be just one of the many fake and hopeless leads the families of the missing children have had to put up with over the years.\nThe Arnold family quickly grew unsatisfied with the police investigation into their daughter\u2019s disappearance, so they ended up hiring a couple of private investigators \u2013 Jon Swaim and Dan James. Swaim personally went to Port Lavaca, TX with at least 100 volunteers to investigate after he received a tip that the girls had been killed and taken there. This tip, however, proved fruitless. Over the next few years, Swaim would continue to investigate and push the police to do so as well. Unfortunately, Swaim died in 1979 from an apparent suicide, and before he died, he requested that all his case files be destroyed, including the Fort Worth Missing Trio. As a result, all his knowledge about the case is gone from the world.\nDan James, on the other hand, is alive and well, and he\u2019s still investigating the case. His work has uncovered a few interesting details about the family, some bordering on rumor. For instance, Tommy was actually engaged to Debra before he met and married her younger sister Rachel, and James believes the two were having an affair at the time Rachel vanished. He believes Rachel was cheating on her husband as well. Additionally, he believes that Debra and Rachel had an altercation at a bowling alley the night before Rachel disappeared, and that Rachel knew criminals who were in town the day the girls went missing. For all these weird circumstances, however, James stresses that there is no proof Debra was in any way involved in her younger sister\u2019s disappearance.\nThough James may accept her innocence, the families involved often don\u2019t feel the same way. Rachel\u2019s younger brother Rusty often holds her in enmity, believing she may have been involved. Debra herself has repeatedly defended herself against such claims. As she tells it, Rusty is fanatical and has a faulty memory, imposing negative feelings on her and good ones on their sister, such as his belief that Rachel taught him to play guitar; in reality, Debra says, she taught him, as Rachel was unable to play herself. In 2000, Debra told Fort Worth\u2019s Star-Telegram newspaper that she \u201chas nothing to hide.\u201d Following the publication of those words, Rusty, Renee\u2019s parents and Julie\u2019s mother all signed the following letter asking her to \u201ccooperate with the FBI\u201d and \u201ctake a polygraph test.\u201d Clearly, not everyone trusts her in this matter. Tommy is also often a subject of theories surrounding the girls\u2019 disappearance.\nVarious witnesses have claimed to have seen the girls at the mall before they went missing, and most agree they got into a vehicle with someone else, though the details aren\u2019t all a perfect match. One witness says it was a van, another a truck; one says there was one man, another multiple. One witness said the man told him not to get involved because it was a \u201cfamily matter.\u201d Another says the girls got into a car with a mall security guard and seemed happy, not afraid.\nTheories about the disappearance of the Fort Worth Missing Trio are as abundant as they are different. Some believe the girls were victims of sex trafficking aka \u201cwhite slavery\u201d; others believe they were killed, or that only Rachel is alive. One girl, suspicious of her own past, contacted Rusty one day saying she believed she was Julie Ann Moseley, and even Julie\u2019s mother thought she looked just like her. However, a DNA test shut down the connection. As time presses on, the girls\u2019 families continue searching for them to this very day, hoping that, one day, they will show themselves again. However, after almost 50 years, they still remain to be found.\nWhat are your thoughts? Could the girls still be alive? Was Rachel forced to write the letter sent to Tommy? Why were the presents in the car?

She had been in critical condition since she was seriously injured in a traffic accident in Shaoguan on November 9. Wu was declared dead on Wednesday afternoon. Her organs were removed on Thursday afternoon.\nBefore she died, Wu told her parents of her wish to donate her organs to help others and repay society.\n\"Wu's liver was successfully transplanted to a 41-year-old man from a local property management company. The man has had liver cancer for years and has been in very poor condition\", Huo Feng said at a news conference on Thursday night.\nBut Huo did not reveal details of the patients who received Wu's kidneys and corneas.\nVice-Minister Huang said he was deeply moved by Wu's gift.\n\"I think Wu would have been happy if she had known her organs have helped save others' lives,\" Huang said.\nOn Wednesday morning, Huang also acted as the operating surgeon for a 52-year-old woman surnamed Zhang who donated her liver, kidneys and corneas after she died of cerebral hemorrhage in Guangzhou.\nZhang's liver was transplanted to a man of a similar age. The man who had cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer has waited for a liver transplant for more than two months.\nZhang's two kidneys were transplanted to another man and a woman, both in their 30s, who had urinaemia and had been on the hospital's waiting list for kidney transplants for many years.\nZhang's corneas were transplanted to a 5-month-old child from Zhuhai and a 65-year-old man from Shenzhen.\n\"Zhang's donation has helped save three lives and helped another two people recover their sight,\" Huang told media after the operations at the No 3 Hospital Affiliated to Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou on Wednesday.\nHuang said he paid homage the organ donor Zhang before starting the transplant operation.\nHuang is a well-known expert in liver transplants.\nChina has become the second-largest country in terms of organ transplants, Huang said.\nSince the country introduced a posthumous organ donation system in March 2010, China has completed organ transplant surgeries for 465 organ donors in 38 designated hospitals across the nation from March 2, 2010, to September 30.\nThe system was jointly implemented by the Red Cross Society of China and the Ministry of Health. It is aimed at encouraging more people to donate their organs after death to help people in need.\nA total of 1,279 organs have been donated for life-saving purposes in the past two and a half years, Huang said. Of the organ donors, more than 120 came from Guangdong.\nChina's reliance on organ transplants from condemned prisoners will end within two years as the donation system is proving successful, Huang said.", "media": null, "score": 44, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "comment_count": 2, "over_18": true}, "32": {"id": "16ph12t", "locked": false, "subreddit": "urbanmyths", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "verystrangeshit", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1695447349.543553, "created_utc": 1695405812.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/21g322ivjupb1.png", "title": "In Japan, it is believed that some of us are destined to be with a particular partner in this life.

I was 13 at this point and my brother was 16 and was out with friends. \nI used to go out until late at night drinking on the park with friends. My dad was an alcoholic and always too drunk to know if I was at home or not, I had free reign and no rules or boundaries. My dad used to invite random alcoholic/drug using strangers into the house. Often, when I came home, these strangers and my dad would be passed out/asleep from too much alcohol. Or they would barely notice I was there and I\u2019d go straight to my room. \nOne day I\u2019d come back from being out with friends. It was the early hours. I walked through the living room to go upstairs to my room and my dad was asleep on the armchair. The guy he\u2019d brought back was around mid 50s, I didn\u2019t recognise him. He looked at me and something was off about him. He smiled and stared and tried to start a conversation with me but I was keen to get to my bedroom. \nI went upstairs and got my pyjamas on for bed and then dashed to use the bathroom. As I was walking to the bathroom, he said to me, \u201cYou look nice in those pyjamas\u201d and he was smiling at me and creeping me out. I went back to my room instead of using the bathroom and I shut the door behind me. I had a lock on my bedroom door and I used that. He was then trying to open my bedroom door and I was so scared because I knew something was off and that he had bad intentions. I dragged my bed across my room to block the door for in case he barged it open and broke the lock. He\u2019s knocking on the door, \u201cI\u2019m just trying to say hello, don\u2019t be so rude, open the door\u201d. I\u2019m not responding. I\u2019m panicking. I was a smart 13 year old and I knew I was in danger. \nThe bed is blocking the door and it\u2019s still locked and I can hear him pushing against the door, trying to get inside. \nI open my bedroom window and I scream again and again, \u201cHELP! HELP! PLEASE!\u201d at the top of my lungs. \nWhat I later found out was that my neighbour heard me and, knowing my dad was an alcoholic, was assuming something had happened to him. He came round. Must have seen that my dad is asleep. He comes up to my room and he\u2019s knocking to get in and I can hear his voice, a voice of safety. Although I trusted my neighbour, I\u2019m so shook up that I\u2019m now just sat in the corner of my room in a ball crying - shaking and panicked. He knocks the door open and is pushing it open against the weight of the bed. He came in and checked on me assuming I must be hurt. He just holds me whilst I compose myself and try and explain what has happened. The man is now gone. But I knew he could come back anytime in the future and my dad was never sober enough for me to have ever been able to explain. \nThis was the final straw for social services and that\u2019s the night I ended up in the care system. \nEdit I ended up living with my auntie until 16 so I had it much easier than most. \u2764\ufe0f", "media": null, "score": 301, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comment_count": 18, "over_18": true}, "35": {"id": "16k6cke", "locked": false, "subreddit": "morbidhistory", "stickied": false, "category": "Crime", "author": "dannydutch1", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1695447350.0404112, "created_utc": 1694867296.0, "url": "https://www.dannydutch.com/post/the-mad-monk-that-burnt-2000-people-at-the-stake", "title": "A frail 78-year-old Dominican monk died on this day in 1498...and thousands of people rejoiced.

I get paid to do data science, but not biology.\nPeru mummies: WTF.\nThere are lots of people talking about the anatomy side of things: the finger bones, the hips, etc. Which is great. The more smart people working on this, the better. I'm definitely not one of the people you want analyzing that.\nBut there were other claims made in that Mexican hearing. Specifically, claims about DNA. And I thought, well, that's something I know how to do. I've been inspired by Avi Loeb's \"we don't need to wait for them, we can do it ourselves\" approach. In that spirit, I'm not going to wait.\nAnother Redditor shared the links to three purported genetic sequences from the mummies. So now I'm going to analyze them and see what they tell us.\nFor those who are used to interacting with computers and having them respond quickly, genomics is a bit of a shock. Individual steps can take hours to run. Over the weekend I had steps that took 13 hours each. I've basically been building and running these pipelines since last week, inspecting the results manually at each step. I hope to have something useful to say about them, and to be able to share both the process and the results.\nI'm still working on data prep, but I'm hoping that's finished by tomorrow (right now it's running the alignments against the reference human genome) and I can start some of the analysis steps.\nScreenshot as a teaser. I'm running all of this locally, not in the cloud, but I'll share my pipeline and make all of the data available to the community.\nEdit 1, 21 Sep: \nOk folks, shout out the mods: the post is staying!

They\u2019re both crushing it already, and we are now coordinating our work together.\nThere\u2019s a github repo here, but it\u2019s kind of a combination of notes and the commands you can run. I\u2019ll work on cleaning this up.  https://github.com/VerbalCant/peru_mummy_pipeline\nIf you want to know where we are now, tl;dr is that we are running kraken2 and then trying a de novo assembly on the reads that are unaligned to the human genome for samples ancient0002 (/u/VerbalCant is doing that one) and ancient0004 (/u/Big_Tree_Fall_Hard is processing that one). we\u2019ve also done some digging into the protocols and results that were posted by the Mexican researchers.

A peer-reviewed study of the body composition is not yet available.\nRyan Graves, who was in attendance, regarded the event as a significant step backwards in the UAP issue.\n\u200b\nSeptember 14th \u2013 NASA shares the UAP Independent Study Report and hosts an accompanying public press conference\nNASA hosts a UAP press conference to discuss the findings of its\u00a0UAP Independent Study Report. The independent study team\u2019s\u00a0overall recommendation\u00a0for NASA from its report is that the agency can play a prominent role in the government\u2019s effort to understand UAP by furthering the study and data collection of UAP.\nNASA appointed Mark\u00a0McInerney as its new director of UAP research. McInerney previously served as NASA\u2019s liaison to the Department of Defense covering limited UAP activities for the agency.\n\u201cThe top takeaway from the study is that there is a lot more to learn. The NASA study did not find any evidence that UAP have an extraterrestrial origin, but we don\u2019t know what these UAP are.\u201d said NASA Administrator\u00a0Bill Nelson.\n\u200b\nSeptember 14th \u2013 Rep. Anna Paulina Luna confirms there will be more public UAP hearings in the near future, while a Select Committee remains out of reach\n\u201cJust got word that we will not be getting the UAP select committee.

Notably \u2013 this specific phrasing correlates precisely to the IC IG's official taxonomy and divisional structure, with one glaring omission: investigation.\nRep. Burchett was not pleased with what he viewed to be a complete non-answer to his questions, and saw it as more evidence of a 'cover-up'. If the IC IG were in the midst of an active investigation into these alleged UAP programs however, he would be justified in keeping details to a minimum until the investigation is concluded.\n\u200b\nSeptember 16th \u2013 Oversight Chair Comer on UAP Select Committee: \"If it was voted on today, I would vote for it\"\nSeemingly at odds with statements made by Reps. Burchett and Luna earlier this week, Oversight Chair Comer tells Matt Laslo the following:\n\nhe understands there's a large demand for a UAP Select Committee to independently dig into the veracity of UAP whistleblower claims\nhe'd vote for a UAP Select Committee if such a vote happened today\nhe believes it should be under the House Committee on Science, Space and Tech\n\n---\nThings to look out for in the near future:\nSeptember\n\nFollowing the UAP hearing on the 26th of July, Members of Congress continue to call for a select committee with subpoena authority, to \u201cgo about the task of collecting information from the Pentagon and elsewhere\u201d on unidentified flying objects.\nSteven Spielberg's production company will launch a 4 part docu-series covering UAP/UFO Encounters on Netflix on September 27th (Link)\n\nNovember\n\nThe SOL Foundation is holding its first annual conference at Stanford University on November 17-19, 2023.

Most commentators don't expect this to happen before December 2023.\nAccording to Senator Gillibrand \u2013 an updated UAP report from AARO can be expected by January 2024. This update was originally expected in August 2023, but faced delays.\nReps. Moskowitz, Luna, and Burchett have repeatedly stated their intent to hold field hearings to overcome stonewalling from the Pentagon and military establishment\u00a0\u2013 \"I think we [Congress] should try to get into one of these places [housing UAP evidence]...and if they won't let us in I think we should have a field hearing right outside the building...and the military will have to explain why that is.\" \u2013 Rep. Moskowitz (D). It is currently unknown when we might expect that to occur.\nSeveral journalists have indicated that first-hand witnesses of the alleged UAP legacy programs are in the process of providing testimony/evidence to the relevant authorities (e.g. the IC IG) and/or are on the verge of making public statements in the near future (Example 1, example 2, example 3)\n\n----\nCredits (def. missing some...):\n\nRonak P\nu/Schadensfall\nu/aryelbcn\nDrDisclosure89\nRoss\nDefense Scoop\nGood trouble show\nAskapol\n", "media": null, "score": 71, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "comment_count": 14, "over_18": false}, "48": {"id": "16lukjc", "locked": false, "subreddit": "unresolvedmysteries", "stickied": false, "category": "Crime", "author": "StarlightDown", "link_flair_text": "Lost Artifacts", "time": 1695447361.2365544, "created_utc": 1695041096.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/16lukjc/where_is_cleopatras_tomb/", "title": "Where is Cleopatra's tomb?", "permalink": "/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/16lukjc/where_is_cleopatras_tomb/", "selftext": "Cleopatra spent her last days in writhing pain and misery. Her torso was marred with wounds, self-inflicted\u2014first after witnessing the horrific suicide of her lover Mark Antony, who stabbed himself to a slow death after the defection of his entire cavalry, and again after her house arrest, when she grabbed a dagger before being quickly disarmed by a Roman soldier. Already bedridden, her wounds became infected and she developed a violent fever. In an act of defiance, she refused to eat. Her defiance relented when her captors threatened to harm her children. A political prisoner of her fame wasn't about to die so soon. It was decided that Cleopatra would be brought to Rome as a trophy of the Roman conquest of Egypt, and the crowning achievement of Octavian\u2014a man we know today by the name Augustus Caesar, the first Emperor of the Roman Empire. Link, link\nIn an account that may be more mythology than history, a peasant brought Cleopatra a basket of figs. The guards thought nothing of it. Shortly afterward, Octavian received a letter from Cleopatra, asking to be buried alongside Mark Antony. He rushed to her quarters, but it was too late. The bodies of her servants, forever loyal to their Queen, surrounded her. Snakebites dotted her arms, freeing her from the life of captivity and humiliation she dreaded. Queen Cleopatra VII was found dead on her bed, still dressed in her beautiful ornate regalia.\nOctavian respected her wishes, and at their grand mausoleum, buried Cleopatra and Mark Antony together.\nWhere is Cleopatra's tomb?\nCleopatra and her story has been celebrated across the ages. Perhaps that makes it all the more unfortunate that we no longer know where her tomb is. Even more remarkable is the fact that we do not know the location of any tomb for any ruler of Ptolemaic Egypt, dating back to Alexander the Great, who conquered Egypt for the Greeks. Finding just one tomb could point us in the right direction, at least. What do historical records have to say?\n\nIn the late fourth or early third century B.C. the body of Alexander was removed from its tomb in Memphis and transported to Alexandria where it was reburied. At a still later date, Ptolemy Philopator (222/21-205 B.C.) placed the bodies of his dynastic predecessors as well as that of Alexander, all of which had apparently been buried separately, in a communal mausoleum in Alexandria.  \nThe literary tradition is clear that the tomb was located at the crossroads of the major north-south and east-west arteries of Alexandria. Octavian, the future Roman emperor Augustus, visited Alexandria shortly after the suicide of Cleopatra VII in 30 B.C. He is said to have viewed the body of Alexander, placing flowers on the tomb and a golden diadem upon Alexander's mummified head.\n\nThis seemingly narrows down the search to Alexandria, an ancient, storied city that served as the capital of Egypt for one thousand years. Ptolemaic rulers were buried at a grand communal mausoleum in the heart of the city. How hard could it be to lose a giant mausoleum in the middle of a major city? Your guess is as good as mine, but there's a hint that the passage of time was not kind to this monument, and as far back as the 4th century CE:\n\nWhen St. John Chrysostom visited Alexandria in A.D. 400, he asked to see Alexander\u2019s burial place, adding, \u201cHis tomb even his own people know not.\u201d It is a question that continues to be asked now, 1,613 years later.  \nCleopatra took gold from the tomb to pay for her war against Octavian (soon to be the emperor Augustus). There were subsequent visits to the tomb by numerous Roman emperors and then, beginning in A.D. 360, a series of events that included warfare, riots, an earthquake, and a tsunami, threatened\u2014or perhaps destroyed\u2014the tomb by the time of Chrysostom\u2019s visit. From that point on, Alexander\u2019s tomb can be considered lost.\n\nThose earthquakes and tsunamis did more than just potentially destroy a mausoleum. They permanently submerged a large section of ancient Alexandria underwater. Unfortunately, this might be the reason why we can't find the tomb of Cleopatra, or of any Ptolemaic Egyptian ruler. They're all in the Mediterranean.\nWas Cleopatra really buried in Alexandria?\nThe twist is that there's a good chance that Cleopatra was not buried in Alexandria. Historians are in disagreement about even the general location of Cleopatra's resting place, but it is clear that she built a new mausoleum for herself and Mark Antony. The mausoleum was incomplete at the time of her death, but Octavian finished its construction. It was adjacent to a landmark temple of Isis. Link\nA 45-minute drive west of Alexandria lies a temple of Isis that has attracted more attention than most. Named Taposiris Magna, this Ptolemaic Egyptian site drew the interest of archaeologists after the 2006 discovery of several hundreds of ancient coins depicting Cleopatra. Excavations here have also uncovered Isis figurines, Greco-Roman-style mummies, and even a mask which has been claimed to bear the resemblance of Mark Antony. Ground-penetrating radar has revealed three possible sealed subterranean burial chambers in the area. Most recently, in 2022, archaeologists discovered a 43-foot deep, 4,300-foot long tunnel at the site, considered an unusual construction for its time. The purpose of the tunnel is unknown, and there has been speculation that it could lead to more tombs. Link, link\nMany archaeologists still believe that Cleopatra's mausoleum was in Alexandria, and was destroyed along with much of the ancient city long ago. A digital reconstruction of ancient Alexandria made by historian Michael Bengtsson, backed up by historical accounts, places the mausoleum on a peninsula upon the coast. If it really was here, it was certainly destroyed by a tsunami and would only exist as underwater rubble now at best.\nMaybe that's for the best. Countless tombs across history have been looted and vandalized. People robbed them of their treasure, but more disappointingly, they robbed them of our heritage. If the last of Cleopatra's great tomb is sitting scattered beneath the seafloor sediment, safe from robbers but waiting for future archaeologists to bring them into the light, I'd be happy.", "media": null, "score": 960, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comment_count": 36, "over_18": false}, "49": {"id": "16lcrch", "locked": false, "subreddit": "morbidreality", "stickied": false, "category": "Crime", "author": "Thedrunkenmastertyle", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1695447361.8603902, "created_utc": 1694986165.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/16lcrch", "title": "Photos of war crimes by Arkan's Tigers in the city of Bijeljina during the War in Bosnia (1992-1995).", "permalink": "/r/MorbidReality/comments/16lcrch/photos_of_war_crimes_by_arkans_tigers_in_the_city/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 3416, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comment_count": 128, "over_18": true}, "50": {"id": "16n12x3", "locked": false, "subreddit": "jessicamshannon", "stickied": false, "category": "Crime", "author": "jessicamshannon", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1695447362.0584576, "created_utc": 1695154360.0, "url": "https://reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/s/E87eVempRO", "title": "Bodies scatter the roads after Hurricane Daniel in Libya", "permalink": "/r/Jessicamshannon/comments/16n12x3/bodies_scatter_the_roads_after_hurricane_daniel/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 11, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "comment_count": 0, "over_18": true}, "51": {"id": "16lyddb", "locked": false, "subreddit": "urbanmyths", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "wetpipedreams", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1695447362.240488, "created_utc": 1695050369.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UrbanMyths/comments/16lyddb/that_time_the_queen_kidnapped_10_native_children/", "title": "That time the Queen kidnapped 10 Native children and they were never heard or seen from ever again.", "permalink": "/r/UrbanMyths/comments/16lyddb/that_time_the_queen_kidnapped_10_native_children/", "selftext": "One quick Google search will turn up results from sources such as Reuters, usatoday or even Snopes stating that such an event never happened and that all claims stating as such are \"obviously\" false however to the trained eye who knows to look a little deeper past these publicity fronts used to brainwash the masses and convice them of their own \"truth\", a deeper, more sinister story lies in wait.\nThe day is October 10th, 1964. The location, a residential school located in Kamloops, Canada about a 5 hr drive from the American border. The Queen and Prince Philip had decided to come pay a visit to the lands first generational, youthful inhabitants for reasons to this day still unbeknownst. I introduce to you the only surviving member of a group of 3 boys who claim to have bare witnessed to the abduction of about 10 children whos grieving parents to this day still have no knowledge as to what became of them. William Coombes recounted that said group of 10 children were amoung the brightest in their classes and had left with the Queen and Prince Phillip on a \"Picnic\". \"In October, 1964 when I was 12 years old, I was an inmate at the Kamloops school and we were visited by the Queen of England and Prince Phillip. I remember it was strange because they came by themselves, no big fanfare or nothing. But I recognized them and the school principal told us it was the Queen and we all got given new clothes and good food for the first time in months the day before she arrived.The day the Queen got to the school, I was part of a group of kids that went on a picnic with her and her husband and some of the priests, down to a meadow near Dead Man\u2019s Creek. I remember it was weird because we all had to bend down and kiss her foot, a white laced boot.After awhile, I saw the Queen leave the picnic with ten children from the school, and those kids never returned. We never heard anything more about them and never met them again even when we were older. They were all from around there but they all vanished.The group that disappeared was seven boys and three girls, in age from six to fourteen years old. They were all from the smart group in class. Two of the boys were brothers and they were Metis from Quesnel. Their last name was Arnuse or Arnold. I don\u2019t remember the others, just an occasional first name like Cecilia and there was an Edward.What happened was also witnessed by my friend George Adolph, who was 11 years old at the time and a student there too. But he's dead now.\".\nWilliams was subject to multiple forms of abuse during his time at the school that included being tied down to a wooden rack where he had been physically assaulted by one of the Male members whos name was Brother Murphy of the Church who worked as staff at the time. In addition to this, Williams also stated to have seen the same male staff throw an eight year old girl to her death from a balcony aswell as bury another with another priest in the schools orchard late one night. Why am I including all of these extra details you may ask? It is indisputable that such horrors and tragedies occured at the Kamloops residential school as a mass grave site filled with children was just uncovered in recent years, what would it be for a group of 10 children to go missing and vanish into thin air\nFast forward now to 2013, An international court located in Brussels (ICLCJ) found Queen Elizabeth and Prince Phillip guilty for the disaperance of 10 native children from the catholic residential school in Kamloops B.C. The arrest warrant issued by six judges of the international common law court of Justice in Brussels had been issued however Canadian courts refused to her the case. From what I have been able to dig up, nothing ever became of that arrest warrant so I dont know how much weight this court in brussels held however I am sure arresting the Queen regardless of who indicts her isnt as easy as it sounds as far as an arrest process goes. So, what ever happened to William you might ask? He died suddenly in hospital shortly before he was to go public about the abduction and disapperance of his school mates. He was aged 59 and in good health, scheduled to be a primary witness at the opening session of the international Tribunal into Crimes of the Church and State on September 12th in London, England. A source close to William claimed that he had gone to the hospital and while there underwent \"testing\" despite the fact that William had always been of sound health and never had any adverse health events in his past. During this testing, Williams health began to deteriorate, \"I last saw William ten days ago, on the eve of my departure for a European speaking tour, and he looked better than i had seen him in years\" according to his partner Mae. His cause of death remains undisclosed. The vancouver coroners office refuses to comment on Williams death. The Kamloops school was closed in 1977 and the parents of the missing children have to this day been prevented from taking any such legal action in the court of law, all but being dismissed and from what i can tell, this was the reasoning for such matters to be brought to the attention of the international common law court in Brussels.\nKevin Annett is the name of the man who set out the \"Prima facie\" evidence for Queen Elizabeth and Prince Phillips personal involvement in the disapperance of the 10 native children who were abducted between the dates of October 5th-13th never to be seen or heard from again. Since 2008, Queen Elizabeth and the Canadian government have continuously denied requests by the ITCCS'S for excavation even though a mass grave site has been discovered moreso recently in the last few years.\nNow, with that being said regardless of wether or not you believe this event ever took place, you can be the judge of that but one irrefutable fact is that this school in Kamloops was one of over 130 schools of its kind operating in Canada between 1874 and 1977 with the last residential school all but having been closed in 1997 (Who was in charge of said school and why it was allowed to stay open is still a hot topic up for debate). This time in Canadas history portrays a very dark reality where Native children effectively had their identitys stripped away in an attempt to assimilate them to the ways of the Catholic church. Sexual, Physical, Emotional and Psychological abuse went on rampant for over a hundred years unchecked and the effects of these schools can still be seen in our countries native identifying members to this day. So with that being said, what are we thinking? Adrenochrome harvesting? Satanic rituals involving Child Sacrafice? Id love to know what you think in the comments.\nEdit: People are having a meltdown in the comments over a brief oversight I had when stating that this event happened when the Queen came to visit during the 100th anniversary of confederation which took place in 1967 and not when the events of said abduction of 10 native children took place in October of 1964. I have removed the line \"The Queen and Prince Philip had come to visit Canada to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Confederation\" and nothing more.

So I am writing this to get it off my chest so anyways lets begin.\nTwo almost three years ago I was seventeen years old at this point I was accustomed to being in horrible situations, as all I had was my mother and she could not hold down a job for long because she had her own issues to tackle and so as I grew up we stayed in and out of roommates houses. We never really had our own place to stay except twice but that didn't last long either and we would be forced into a new environment with a snap of a finger. So when I was 17 we are lead into a situation where we are going to be homeless again and I was used to it at this point as I had slept in the street more than I'd like. The day comes when we have to leave our roommates house and my mom is able to stay at her boyfriends trailer. I had nowhere to go as I had no friends at this point as I halted my friendships because they were bad for my health and mental state and overall were toxic. My mom offered me to go with her but I didn't want to as I felt like getting between my Mom and her boyfriend was kind of weird plus I'm used to the street and I didn't think it was as bad as it was at the time.\nSo here we are I get dropped of at a McDonalds and I eat some burgers before I go off into the streets once more. Eventually the sun fled and darkness was all that remained and so I look for a place to sleep for the night. I went into many places that night trying to sleep but none of them were working because it was either too hot or the lights were too bright or the mosquitos were biting me. That's when I remember a house that I used to go into to chill in, this house was under construction and nearly finished so the doors all shut and the windows were all settled so there were no Mosquitos. I go through the back like always and I make my way upstairs. Eventually I settle in the bathroom because there is less debris on the floor. \nSo I lay there and I try to sleep. Eventually I hear some sounds down stairs but I didn't think anything of it. I figured it was the door that I came through swinging open and close or something.  Eventually after laying there for maybe a hour I open up my phone and I look at old photos of my life thinking about how messed up it was that I got to this point and how I lost everything. The noises were still happening this entire time but I paid no mind to it. Eventually for whatever reason I get up and I go to sit down on the back porch because I just couldn't sleep. \nI make my way down stairs and out the back door to the porch. I am messing around on my phone for maybe 5 minutes when it happens. I see movement to my left from the back door I just exited from. I glance over and time itself freezes. At first I think that it's a illusion but I was in fact wrong. I see a man shrouded in darkness peering past the wall inside to gaze at me. \nHis lower half of his figure was behind the wall entirely and I could not see anything but his upper body. The rest of his body has leaning to the left peaking behind this wall almost like the man was trying not to let me see his full body as it would make his presents known. The man was a pure black silhouette and I could not make out any features. After noticing him I just sat there and stared at him for what seemed like forever but was probably a minute or two. I expected him to come outside and talk to me because I normally talked to a lot of homeless people and I thought the man was just homeless.  He didn't come outside though, he had not moved at all actually. \nHe was as still as a statue, quiet as a mouse, maybe if I had not noticed him he would have stared at me the entire time. I eventually after staring at him got up and got my bicycle and made my way out of the property. As I am walking out of the backyard I peer into the window that is next to the door I saw the man in. The moonlight revealed the man was still there only now he was watching me walk out of the property. I could tell because the moonlight revealed the top of the mans head and I saw his left eye gazing at me. He was a white male who was very tall and had a jacket of some kind on. \nI could not make out many details because he was still cloaked in darkness. After seeing this I just move a little faster out of there. I got to the front of the house on the street and I looked inside to see if I could see him again. I could not. I got on my bicycle and waved goodbye to the house because I figured the man was still watching me. Then I drove away. For the rest of the night I could not sleep. I tried two different spots but both were no luck.\nThis is where the story ends I know I didn't have a crazy chase or fight to the death or anything but this was real life and its not the same as the movies or books. I don't know what the man was doing in there, I assume he was trying to sleep like I was but the way he was staring on me was very unnerving. It makes me wonder how long the man was in the house for and what would have happened if I actually fell asleep in the house. Would he have stared at me while I was asleep completely blinded to his presents? Or did he have other intentions? I will never know but now I don't go into houses like that anymore at all after this experience.\nSo, to the man shrouded in darkness, lets not meet again.\n\u200b\nEdit 09/18/2023: Upon request I spaced out the block of text into paragraphs.", "media": null, "score": 137, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comment_count": 14, "over_18": true}, "53": {"id": "16kvt7y", "locked": false, "subreddit": "morbidhistory", "stickied": false, "category": "Crime", "author": "GeneralDavis87", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1695447362.7746832, "created_utc": 1694941496.0, "url": "https://youtu.be/__A3YyHL2Q4?si=qb5fkxo48gZjPmQT", "title": "1st Marine Division in Action at Bunker Hill North Korea", "permalink": "/r/MorbidHistory/comments/16kvt7y/1st_marine_division_in_action_at_bunker_hill/", "selftext": "", "media": {"type": "youtube.com", "oembed": {"provider_url": "https://www.youtube.com/", "version": "1.0", "title": "1st Marine Division in Action at Bunker Hill North Korea", "type": "video", "thumbnail_width": 480, "height": 200, "width": 356, "html": "<iframe width=\"356\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/__A3YyHL2Q4?feature=oembed&enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen title=\"1st Marine Division in Action at Bunker Hill North Korea\"></iframe>", "author_name": "The Federal File", "provider_name": "YouTube", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/__A3YyHL2Q4/hqdefault.jpg", "thumbnail_height": 360, "author_url": "https://www.youtube.com/@TheFederalFile"}}, "score": 10, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "comment_count": 0, "over_18": false}, "54": {"id": "16lh2tb", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ghosts", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Moist-Customer-1953", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1695447364.224342, "created_utc": 1694997477.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/16lh2tb/toddler_says_shes_seeing_ghosts_after_an_accident/", "title": "Toddler says she\u2019s seeing ghosts after an accident", "permalink": "/r/Ghosts/comments/16lh2tb/toddler_says_shes_seeing_ghosts_after_an_accident/", "selftext": "I\u2019m not sure if this is the right place to post, we\u2019ve recently been in a car accident it was pretty knarly but we are all okay.

I wrote what I was told she said by my friend\u2019s mother. But today I was actually able to speak to the husband of the woman who told the story, and his account is more detailed, as well as synonymous with what his wife had said. His wife had drawn the picture for reference of exactly what it looked like, which is extremely impressive, considering she drew this when I got in touch with them this morning. \nI was able to spend about 25 minutes or so actually on the property where this happened, which is when I was given the illustration as well as the account. Both the wife and husband are late 30\u2019s, with two small children. She is a part time nurse, and he works for Kimberly Clark. My initial thought was \u201cthese people have no reason to come up with this.\u201d I was also able to tell them our account from last year, and some of what I was able to glean from the internet about these things. I was not able to find tracks, or even a broken branch, although the poultry wire was bent exactly where they said it stepped over. There was no hair, or anything of the like. \nThis is what the husband told me. He said his wife woke him up around 1:45 on Saturday night (Sunday morning, technically) and said she could hear the geese freaking out in the pen, which means there was probably a coyote or a fox. He got the spotlight, and the gun, and went out the front door, and down the stairs. They did not turn any of the lights on, as he wanted to be able to get as close to whatever it was as he could, so he could have a chance to shoot it, whatever it was. He said he got within about 20 yards from the chicken coop, and figured he could get a shot or two in on the animal inside. So he flipped the spotlight on in his left hand, and said \u201cI didn\u2019t know what the hell to think.\u201d I could tell on his face he was concerned just telling the story. His description of what he saw was \u201clike something you would see in a horror movie.\u201d I asked him to give me all the details he could, and he started with \u201cthe weight and size of this thing was at least 7-800 pounds, easily. I was so shocked to see this that I didn\u2019t even know what I was looking at.\u201d He said the color of it was a very dark brown or black. The hair was all over the body, and about 4-6 inches long. When he first saw it, it was stepping backwards over the chicken fence. He said the arms were very long, and it had its left hand pushing down on the wires of the fence, and the left leg mostly over it. He reinstated twice that \u201cthe hands were like gorilla hands, but way larger.\u201d It was apparently hunched over, as if trying to avoid the light. His description of the face was \u201cthe head was just sitting on top of the shoulders, like a gorilla. The eyes were greenish/white from the light hitting them. There was definitely eyeshine.\u201d There were no ears visible from what he told me, and he said \u201cthe nose wasn\u2019t a gorilla nose by any means; It was almost human, but it wasn\u2019t exactly. Like a really flat looking nose, that was really wide.\u201d The skin was greyish in color, and he said he didn\u2019t notice the teeth, really. I assume that means there were no prominent canines, at least not like that of a chimp or a gorilla. He couldn\u2019t get over the size of it, and told me at least 5 times that it was \u201clike a giant.\u201d And \u201cit made Shaq look small.\u201d What stood out to me was, the second he heard his wife screaming from the house, it looked like it glanced towards the house, and immediately put one of the dead chickens in its mouth by the throat before turning around and taking off on two legs. He said he couldn\u2019t really tell what else it had, but that it had what he believed at the time to be two chickens in its right hand. It later turned out to be a chicken and one of the ducks. He never took his eyes off of it. He said when it began to turn after hearing his wife scream, it crouched lower down and almost looked like it side stepped backwards before taking off running. He said nearly exactly what I said in my description last year about what it looked like from the back. He described \u201ca huge chimpanzee that could move like hell.\u201d The last thing he saw was midway across the little clearing, it was on four legs, and literally jumped the fence like it was nothing, which was what his wife also witnessed. He said a few times \u201cthat was the most disturbing part, seeing how it moved.\u201d From his vantage point, it was just \u201creally fast.\u201d And from his wife\u2019s point of view up on the porch, it was \u201cunnaturally fast\u201d and \u201clike it was fast forwarded.\u201d Overall the encounter lasted about 15-25 seconds. They told me, pertaining to the police, that they told them \u201cthere was a giant man or a huge animal stealing from their chicken coop, but they weren\u2019t sure what it was.\u201d The police showed up 30 minutes later and spotlighted the area and saw the marks in the dew in the grass, and some of the feathers as well. From what I was told, they were convinced it was a black bear, or two of them. Which makes little sense, as there are no black bears in this area. They took a report, regardless. I was so grateful to be able to speak to these folks about what had happened. She let me keep the drawing too. It also makes me feel a lot better about my own encounter, which was about 3 miles from this place.\nPS: There was also no smell, and no eerie feeling before this happened. When I asked him what he thought it was, he said \u201cat first I believed it was demonic, like a werewolf or something.\u201d And then said \u201cit had to be a monkey of some kind. It\u2019s just so damn enormous.\u201d Both of them agreed it had to be a Sasquatch, later. In my own words, it\u2019s extremely disturbing seeing these things without any prior knowledge of them.

The obtained specimen, however, was preserved in a way that didn't retain many valuable parts of the animals body, so studying it has proven quite a pain.\nIt is the largest gecko known to science, at 60+ cm long, 50% longer than the next largest gecko, the leachianus.\nFossil evidence, and more recently, DNA studies from the specimen suggests an origin from New Caledonia, however it also fits the description of the maori folk animal, the kawekaweau almost perfectly--a chief who'd claimed to have killed one in 1870 described the kawekaweau as  \"two feet long and as thick as a man\u2019s wrist; colour brown, striped longitudinally with dull red\".\nAnywho, the animal is more or less unanimously considered extinct, since no reports of the animal have appeared since. But to my knowledge, none ever appeared before either. Regardless of whether it's still alive or not, it appeared to have been an incredibly elusive animal nonetheless; perhaps the person who found the original delcourt specimen was just really lucky, and no one else has happened to find the lizard since? Like maybe this lizard is almost like a terrestrial version of the chirodectes jellyfish? (which, for those who don't know, is a species of box jellyfish so rare it's been sighted only twice, and even then the two sightings may have even been separate species, but regardless it is known to not be extinct - https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirodectes)\nAnd with so many rainforest animals that just go undiscovered, like the saola (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saola), which despite it's large size, was first sighted only in 1992 and last in 2013. And bear in mind the likely arboreal lifestyle and not to mention significantly smaller size, even if large for a gecko, of the delcourt giant. \nI guess it's just, it already seemed to be so incredibly rare even back when it was first found; perhaps it's just eluded documentation since, because of how rare it seems to be (and the fact that no one is really looking for it, let alone knowing where to look). But I'm not an expert here, and I'd really appreciate any comments or expertise from more knowledgeable folks here who can help clear things out for me\nThx in advance :3", "media": null, "score": 128, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comment_count": 13, "over_18": false}, "86": {"id": "16mqgj3", "locked": false, "subreddit": "cryptids", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "Sharp-Cobbler-8278", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1695447394.9887471, "created_utc": 1695128617.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptids/comments/16mqgj3/i_live_in_tennessee_and_in_tennessee_there_are_a/", "title": "I live in Tennessee and in Tennessee there are a good amount of deer so when I see this deer while camping I look over try to zoom in on it on my camera and I see that looks weird it's proportions are crooked it's eyes are facing straight so I try to put the flash on and this thing dissappears wtf ?", "permalink": "/r/cryptids/comments/16mqgj3/i_live_in_tennessee_and_in_tennessee_there_are_a/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 46, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "comment_count": 47, "over_18": false}}}
