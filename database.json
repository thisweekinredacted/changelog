The US was capped at a certain amount of Nuclear Weapons they could have in the UK. That cap was lifted 13 days ago or something similar. I think what we are seeing is one of the largest transfers of Nuclear weapons in history. \nI have no idea the timeline as to when they started to alter the treaty but something tells me the Biden Administration wants to disperse their Nuclear weapons to trusted allies before the Trump Admin comes into power and other reasons. Most, if not almost all drones are probably US/UK stuff that's not to say that E.T's are not watching this very closely if not interfering or making themselves known in some manner as UFO's and Nukes go hand in hand and its also possible that some of the activity is Russian and Chinese actors using their own drones to try and surveil this massive movement of Nuclear weapons. That is why the U.S military spokesman said \"We don't know where or who they are, We know they are no harm\" he will obfuscate the truth completely in the first part of the sentence but will tell the truth in the last part and it explains why the US and the UK are not reacting to the apparent threat because its their own gear.\nRussia and the U.S mutually do not want this transfer and policy change to be broadcast openly. Putin would be forced to escalate to not appear weak infront of his country and he has limited options at this point. The U.S doesn't need to broadcast this either as it would be seen as saber rattling and the effect is to strengthen the UK, Russia will know about the transfer and the U.S wants russia to know that going forward even if the U.S were to completely capitulate to Russia the UK will have enough weapons for Mutually Assured Destruction. This is a insurance policy for the US/UK and the free world if the US democracy doesn't survive trump and the U.S leadership becomes vassals to russian leadership and we can no longer rely on the United States to counter Russia(which news flash happened for 4 years under trump's last presidency but now we are in a literal world war).\nIt takes 10-15 days for a military cargo ship to sail from the US to the UK. They probably had the Nukes ready to ship but couldn't go underway until the treaty was alterations were ratified officially which fits into the timeline with all the activity going on 14 days after the treaty changes.\nThis is from the House of Commons in the UK, look at how the start off by saying \" Many of the proposed changes are minor technical amendments relating to outdated language, definitions and terminology\"\nlike its not a major policy change, then the below points are essentially saying \"we cannot rely on the US anymore you are too politically unstable so the Nukes you keep here are actually our nukes now and even if you want them back tough luck\". \nhttps://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-10086/\nhttps://www.state.gov/united-states-and-united-kingdom-bring-amendment-to-mutual-defense-agreement-into-force/\n(This was all copy and pasted from a email I sent last sorry for any errors or formatting issues", "media": null, "score": 768, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "comment_count": 220, "over_18": false}, "5": {"id": "1h0ldfa", "locked": false, "subreddit": "conspiracy", "stickied": false, "category": "Consipiracy", "author": "Swatieson", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1732936046.9890506, "created_utc": 1732651601.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/bgc772pqya3e1.png", "title": "This qualifies as a major conspiracy theory", "permalink": "/r/conspiracy/comments/1h0ldfa/this_qualifies_as_a_major_conspiracy_theory/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 5769, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "comment_count": 855, "over_18": false}, "6": {"id": "1h1au1u", "locked": false, "subreddit": "conspiracyfact", "stickied": false, "category": "Consipiracy", "author": "Disastrous_Monk_4079", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1732936047.3085837, "created_utc": 1732731218.0, "url": "https://v.redd.it/779o6cq12c3e1", "title": "Elvis was a Peado...

It wasn\u2019t anything fancy, but it was cosy, affordable, and had a lot of character. The only thing I didn\u2019t love was the crawlspace under the house. The access door to it was in the laundry room, a square wooden hatch flush with the floor. It was locked from the outside, and I never had any reason to open it. I figured it was just pipes, cobwebs, and the usual creepy crawlspace stuff.\nOne evening, I came home late from work. It had been a stressful day, and all I wanted was to shower and collapse into bed. As I stepped inside, I noticed something strange: my laundry room light was on. I was sure I had turned it off that morning. But I chalked it up to being absentminded in my rush and turned it off again.\nThat night, I woke up around 2 a.m. to a faint noise. At first, I thought it was just the wind, but as I lay there, I realized it was coming from the laundry room\u2014a soft, rhythmic thumping sound. My heart started to race. I debated whether to get up and check or just stay in bed and hope it stopped. Curiosity got the better of me, so I grabbed my phone for light and tiptoed to the laundry room.\nWhen I opened the door, everything was quiet. But then I saw it: the hatch to the crawlspace was slightly ajar. My stomach dropped. I distinctly remembered it being locked, and there was no way I could\u2019ve accidentally opened it. Trying to stay calm, I convinced myself it might be an animal that had somehow gotten in. I shut the hatch tightly and placed a heavy box of detergent on top of it before going back to bed.\nThe next day, I called the landlord to ask if there were any pest issues I should know about. He seemed surprised and said no one had reported anything like that before. Still, he promised to send someone over to check it out.\nThat night, I double-checked the hatch and even put a chair on top of it for good measure. I didn\u2019t hear any noises, and I started to feel a little silly for being so freaked out. But around 3 a.m., I woke up to the sound of my bedroom door creaking open.\nI froze. My bedroom door doesn\u2019t creak unless you push it slowly, and I knew I had closed it before bed. I stayed as still as I could, barely breathing, as I heard soft footsteps shuffle into the room. My phone was on the nightstand, just out of reach. The footsteps stopped right next to my bed. I could feel someone\u2019s presence, their quiet breathing in the dark.\nSummoning every ounce of courage I had, I grabbed my phone, turned on the flashlight, and swung it toward the intruder.\nThere was a man, crouched on the floor, his face pale and gaunt, his eyes wide and unblinking. He looked just as startled as I was. I screamed and bolted out of the room, running outside to the neighbour\u2019s house. I banged on their door until they let me in, and they called the police.\nWhen the officers arrived, they found the man still in my house, hiding in the crawlspace. He had a small mattress, some food wrappers, and a collection of random items he must have taken from my house. The lock on the hatch had been tampered with, and from the looks of it, he had been living under my house for at least a few days\u2014maybe longer.\nThe scariest part? The police said they found a notebook with detailed notes about me. He had written down my daily routine, when I left for work, when I came home, even what I wore. There was also a list of \"plans,\" though they wouldn\u2019t tell me what was on it.\nI moved out the next week and stayed with friends until I found a new place. To this day, I have no idea how he got in or how long he had been watching me before I noticed something was wrong.\nTo the man in the crawlspace: let\u2019s not meet.

One such tale is that of\u00a0Tunnel No. 33, also known as\u00a0Barog Tunnel, nestled along the famous\u00a0Kalka-Shimla Railway\u00a0in\u00a0Himachal Pradesh.\u00a0This seemingly ordinary tunnel has captured the imagination of many due to its tragic past and eerie reputation.\u00a0Known as one of India\u2019s most haunted locations,\u00a0Tunnel No. 33 tells a story\u00a0that intertwines engineering ambition, human tragedy, and\u00a0paranormal intrigue.\nThe Kalka-Shimla Railway: An Engineering Marvel\nThe\u00a0Kalka-Shimla Railway,\u00a0completed in\u00a01903, was a monumental project undertaken during British rule to connect\u00a0Shimla, the summer capital of\u00a0British India,\u00a0to the plains. Winding through the rugged terrain of the\u00a0Shivalik Hills,\u00a0the railway is an engineering marvel with\u00a0over 100 tunnels and countless bridges.\u00a0These tunnels were not just feats of construction but also testaments to the challenges faced by engineers of the time.\nAmong these,\u00a0Tunnel No. 33\u00a0stood out\u2014not for its length or complexity, but for the\u00a0haunting tale\u00a0associated with its\u00a0creation.\nThe Tragic Story of Colonel Barog\nColonel Barog, a British engineer,\u00a0was tasked with constructing\u00a0Tunnel No. 33.\u00a0Given the steep deadlines and difficult terrain, he devised a plan to dig the tunnel from\u00a0both ends simultaneously,\u00a0aiming for the two ends to meet in the middle. While this approach was innovative,\u00a0it required precise calculations to ensure alignment.\nTragically,\u00a0a critical miscalculation\u00a0led to the two ends of the tunnel failing to meet.\u00a0This mistake\u00a0was\u00a0not just a technical failure\u00a0but a significant financial loss for the British authorities.\u00a0Colonel Barog\u00a0faced severe backlash and was fined for his error,\u00a0a punishment that humiliated him both professionally and personally.\nConsumed by shame and despair,\u00a0Colonel Barog\u00a0took his own life near the incomplete tunnel.\u00a0According to local accounts,\u00a0he shot himself in the nearby woods,\u00a0leaving behind a legacy of sorrow. He was reportedly buried not far from the site, and\u00a0the area has since carried his name.\nCompletion of the Tunnel\nAfter\u00a0Colonel Barog\u2019s tragic demise,\u00a0the construction of Tunnel No. 33\u00a0was\u00a0handed over to another engineer, H.S. Harrington.\u00a0Learning from the previous mistakes,\u00a0Harrington enlisted the help of a local sage, whose advice\u00a0proved instrumental in\u00a0successfully aligning and completing the tunnel.\u00a0Today,\u00a0this 1,143-meter-long tunnel\u00a0is the longest on the\u00a0Kalka-Shimla Railway and remains operational, serving as a vital link in this historic route.\nThe Haunted Reputation of Tunnel No. 33\nWhat sets\u00a0Tunnel No. 33\u00a0apart from the other tunnels on the\u00a0Kalka-Shimla Railway\u00a0is the eerie aura that surrounds it.\u00a0Over the years, numerous stories of paranormal activity have emerged,\u00a0making it a popular destination for ghost hunters and thrill-seekers.\nHere are some of the reported phenomena that have contributed to its haunted reputation:\n1. The Ghost of Colonel Barog\nThe spirit of Colonel Barog is said to linger near the tunnel.\u00a0Unlike the malevolent ghosts of popular lore, his apparition is often described as calm and even friendly.\u00a0Locals claim he doesn\u2019t harm anyone, though his presence is palpable.\n2. Unexplained Noises\nVisitors have reported\u00a0hearing strange sounds inside the tunnel,\u00a0including whispers, footsteps, and even chilling screams.\u00a0These noises are most commonly heard late at night\u00a0or during quiet hours when the tunnel is devoid of trains.\n3. Mysterious Lights and Shadows\nStrange lights\u00a0have been seen\u00a0flickering\u00a0within the tunnel, and shadowy figures are said to move through the darkness, vanishing when approached. These sightings have fueled the tunnel\u2019s reputation\u00a0as a hotspot for paranormal activity.\n4. Physical Sensations\nSome visitors have described the\u00a0sensation of being touched or pushed by an unseen force.\u00a0While these experiences are rare, they have left a lasting impression on those who have felt them.\n,\n5. An Overwhelming Sense of Unease\nMany travelers recount feeling an inexplicable\u00a0sense of dread or unease when passing through Tunnel No. 33.\u00a0Even those who do not believe in ghosts have acknowledged\u00a0the strange atmosphere surrounding this place.\nExploring the Mystery: Folklore vs. Reality\nThe story of\u00a0Tunnel No. 33\u00a0and its\u00a0haunted reputation is a fascinating mix of history, legend, and human imagination.\u00a0While the tragic death of\u00a0Colonel Barog is documented,\u00a0the tales of paranormal activity remain anecdotal. Skeptics argue that the eerie experiences\u00a0could be attributed to the tunnel\u2019s isolated location,\u00a0the play of light and shadows,\u00a0or even the psychological impact of its grim history.\nHowever, for those who have experienced the unexplained, these stories are more than mere folklore. The ghost of Colonel Barog,\u00a0they say,\u00a0is a reminder of the emotional toll\u00a0borne by those who undertook ambitious projects under immense pressure.\nTunnel No. 33 Today\nToday,\u00a0Tunnel No. 33\u00a0is a\u00a0popular spot for tourists and paranormal enthusiasts alike.\u00a0It offers a unique blend of\u00a0natural beauty, historical significance,\u00a0and an air of mystery that is hard to resist. While most visitors come to marvel at the engineering feats of the\u00a0Kalka-Shimla Railway, many also hope to catch a glimpse of the supernatural.\nFor thrill-seekers,\u00a0the tunnel is best visited during the evening or at night, when the atmosphere becomes particularly eerie.\u00a0However, it\u2019s important to remember that the tunnel is still operational, and safety should always be a priority.\nLessons from the Legend\nThe tale of\u00a0Tunnel No. 33 is more than just a ghost story.\u00a0It\u2019s a poignant reminder of the human cost of progress, the fragility of mental health, and the enduring power of storytelling.\u00a0Colonel Barog\u2019s life and death highlight the immense pressures\u00a0faced by those tasked with seemingly impossible feats. His ghost, whether real or imagined, continues to evoke empathy and curiosity in equal measure.\nFor some,\u00a0the tunnel represents an engineering marvel\u00a0and a testament to perseverance. For others,\u00a0it\u2019s a place where the past lingers in a tangible, almost supernatural way.\u00a0Either way, Tunnel No. 33 remains\u00a0a symbol of the mysteries that make life\u2014and history\u2014so compelling.\nConclusion\nWhether\u00a0you\u2019re a history buff, a fan of the paranormal,\u00a0or simply someone looking for an offbeat travel destination,\u00a0Tunnel No. 33 is worth a visit.\u00a0Its story is a fascinating blend of fact and folklore, offering a\u00a0unique glimpse into a bygone era.\u00a0As you walk along the tracks or explore the nearby areas, you may find yourself wondering about the man whose name the tunnel bears\u2014a man whose story continues to captivate and haunt us to this day.", "media": null, "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comment_count": 0, "over_18": false}, "15": {"id": "1gyfiml", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ghosts", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Free_Watatsumi", "link_flair_text": "Captured Apparition ", "time": 1732936050.3546243, "created_utc": 1732411929.0, "url": "https://v.redd.it/z0840mt36r2e1", "title": "Security systems at work went off last night, multiple videos caught at the same time as this video.

The first time i saw it it was at night. For context when i was little i used to always stare out the window at night that faced a wooded grove that was about 100 yards or so away from the house and fall asleep staring out the window due to how peaceful the night was in the woods. \nSo one night when i was about 8-9 years old im staring out the window when suddenly i notice two yellow lights in the woods. At first i was confused thinking that a car was somehow in a tree in. But as i stared more the yellow lights dissapeared and then reappeared in the same spot almost like blinking eyes. As my groggy brain took a closer look at the lights i started noticing other  odd things like how the tree these lights were showing up in was a little thicker than i remembered and how there was a giant wolf head in the tree and that the yellow lights alligned with the head to be its eyes. \nThis is when i was getting nervous and i bumped my head on the window accidentaly as i was backing away. \nWell, as soon as my head hit the window. The wolf head turned suddenly towards my window and the rest of the creatures body started emerging from behind the tree. The body was hard to see at first because it was jet black and perfectly blended into the shadows. But now it was stepping out into the moonlight and i was freaking out because this wolf was on two legs. And the top of this wolfs head was a good 10 feet off the ground. The wolf stayed in the treeline but was still very much visable from my window and i could tell that it knew exactly where i was even though there were no lights on outside for it to see me with. By this point i had seen it more than enough so i quickly slammed the curtins shut and hid under my covers that whole night waiting to hear it clawing at the window to get me (fortunately this didnt happen) and i stayed burried under the covers until my alarm clock went off the next morning. I never told anyone about it because although i saw it myself i still couldnt beleve that it had happened. \nThe second encounter happened 12 years later durring a 4th of july celebration. Me and my dad were setting off fireworks in the back yard to celebrate and when we were done with the firework show as my dad and i were packing up for the night i saw the same pitch black wolf head peaking out from behind the shed with the same glowing yellow eyes. The head was absolutely massive. It was every bit the size of the 3 foot wide window on that side of the house. When it saw me staring at it it quickly ducked its head back behind the shed. I told my dad that there was a big dog back there and he chalked it up to coyotes. Well if it was a coyote then how did it manage to stand on two feet and how did its face take up the entirety of a 3 foot window? I dont know for sure what i saw but it matches descriptions that have been given for dogmen by other supposed witnesses so until i see otherwise im gonna say that what i saw was a dogman. It was terrifying to see both times and i never again want to see it or anything like it. \nEdit: forgot to put the date and location sorry", "media": null, "score": 57, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "comment_count": 38, "over_18": false}, "26": {"id": "1h0m6mk", "locked": false, "subreddit": "cryptids", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "houselegs", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1732936059.3625906, "created_utc": 1732653608.0, "url": "https://v.redd.it/o84re4gl4b3e1", "title": "another little watercolor of mine", "permalink": "/r/cryptids/comments/1h0m6mk/another_little_watercolor_of_mine/", "selftext": "", "media": {"reddit_video": {"bitrate_kbps": 2400, "fallback_url": "https://v.redd.it/o84re4gl4b3e1/DASH_720.mp4?source=fallback", "has_audio": false, "height": 870, "width": 720, "scrubber_media_url": "https://v.redd.it/o84re4gl4b3e1/DASH_96.mp4", "dash_url": "https://v.redd.it/o84re4gl4b3e1/DASHPlaylist.mpd?a=1735528059%2CNTViMzVmZTRlNDg4N2RhYTZkOTRiNzZjMjYzYWNkYTViZTc2OTM2YWI4NzIxOGU1ZjQ3OGZjOGE3ZDgwMmU5Ng%3D%3D&v=1&f=sd", "duration": 28, "hls_url": "https://v.redd.it/o84re4gl4b3e1/HLSPlaylist.m3u8?a=1735528059%2CM2NkYTdiYmNjN2FmZTFhYWE5ZDE0ZTc1YjMzMmYwNDY3Yjg1YjQ2NzM5OWU1NWEwYmUzOTdhODc4NTM4ZTg4ZA%3D%3D&v=1&f=sd", "is_gif": false, "transcoding_status": "completed"}}, "score": 634, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comment_count": 20, "over_18": false}, "27": {"id": "1h09k4c", "locked": false, "subreddit": "thetruthishere", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "unsettlingmemorial", "link_flair_text": "Picture/Evidence", "time": 1732936059.6360521, "created_utc": 1732620017.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1h09k4c/unsettling_memorial_found_while_urbexing/", "title": "Unsettling memorial found while urbexing.", "permalink": "/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1h09k4c/unsettling_memorial_found_while_urbexing/", "selftext": "Hey all, tonight a buddy and I went exploring a place we've previously been. But upon arrival, both my friend and I felt a looking sense that was not previously present. We felt instinctively more on edge and aware of our surroundings. Upon making it to the factory, we pulled out our radio to keep an eye on security and listened. Upon listening we heard what sounded to be an alarm system, to be sure we ventured down near towards the sound, upon making it to the front entry, we found what looked to be a mangled raggedy Anne doll. Unsettling? Yes. Frightening? Not quite. \nUpon feeling relatively secure, we then ventured into a building, once we entered we felt a sense of heaviness and dread. Upon walking further we found used needles that looked as if they had been used very recently. When venturing further, I led down a staircase - once at the base I was suddenly startled by what sounded to be a charging sound towards me. Worried for my friend I called to him to see there was no one but him around me. Once we were both at the bottom, I noticed to my left what appeared to be a memorial (picture attached in comments), the note made mention of someone, a kid not too much younger than us that had been dismembered and whose entire body had yet to be found. A scary five weeks prior to our visit tonight. With that being said, the note looks, off? Strangely composed, a trap maybe. The more I look at the picture trying to figure it out, the more dreadful and near tears I feel. At a loss, we're looking for any additional possible explanations.\nTLDR; went urbexing, upon entry looking for alarm systems, we found an old raggedy Anne doll held by its neck. Moving in the the building, we saw needles, I heard a charging sound that seemed to come from no where and we found a memorial for someone who was seemingly killed and disfigured.

In Berlin, regulation was already quite loose; as long as you didn\u2019t explicitly bother anyone, you usually wouldn\u2019t get arrested for smoking in public.\nI\u2019ve been smoking daily for years (I know, it\u2019s not great, but that\u2019s beside the point), so I can function pretty well while stoned. However, I almost never smoke in public\u2014partly to avoid trouble, but mostly because I enjoy the comfort of my own home.\nOne late night, around 3 a.m., I was chilling online with friends, ready to call it a day. I wanted to relax with a joint and one of my favorite shows, but unfortunately, I had no snacks left. Determined to end the night with a proper munchie session, I decided to hit up a nearby Sp\u00e4ti\u2014a small convenience store similar to a 7/11. At that hour, only the sketchiest ones are still open, often operating illegally.\nI grabbed my coat and keys but stopped short before leaving. \u201cWhy not add a little joy to this cold walk?\u201d I thought, rolling a small joint. I lit it as I stepped outside, braving the freezing breeze.\nThe area I live in is pretty rough\u2014mostly foreign residents, many from Arabic countries. Poor integration has led to crime and violence being all too common. Even so, I was in good spirits as I strolled toward the flickering neon sign of the Sp\u00e4ti. Just one more intersection to go.\nA group of men stood at the corner. They looked Middle Eastern, a bit older than me, and watched me as I walked by. It felt normal\u2014nothing to worry about, I thought, already a little high. I crossed the street without giving them much thought.\nThen, I heard a voice call out, \u201cRoutine ID check\u2014please show me your identification.\u201d\nMy heart sank. \u201cOf course, this has to happen the one time I smoke in public,\u201d I thought, turning to face the \"police.\"\nOnly, they weren\u2019t police. It was the group from the intersection, now slowly approaching me. \u201cRoutine ID check\u2014please show me your ID. We\u2019re undercover cops,\u201d one of them said with a smug grin.\nI froze. The fact that they weren\u2019t cops became clear when, despite their demand, none of them reached for any identification. \u201cYou know smoking weed is illegal, don\u2019t you?\u201d the man continued. His pupils were enormous, like saucers. It was obvious these guys had no authority whatsoever.\nThey began circling me. \u201cShow us what\u2019s in your pockets,\u201d the leader demanded.\nSo, it\u2019s a robbery, I thought. As long as I don\u2019t resist, maybe I\u2019ll only lose my phone and the few bills I brought for snacks. Then, a wave of dread hit me: my weekly tips\u2014about \u20ac300 in cash\u2014were also in my pocket. I had forgotten to deposit it earlier. Losing that money would crush my tight budget for the month. What now?\nAs I slowly reached into my pocket, the leader pressed me. \u201cWhat\u2019s taking so long?\u201d I pulled out an old pack of gum and some broken headphones, hoping to satisfy them. \u201cWhere\u2019s your wallet? I need your ID,\u201d he insisted.\nStill fumbling, too stubborn (and stupid) to hand over my tips, I inadvertently revealed something that shocked even me: the glint of a Glock tucked into his belt.\nKnives and metal rods are typical weapons here, but a gun? That was insane, even by local standards. German gun laws are incredibly strict. My adrenaline spiked. Slowly, I pulled out the \u20ac5 bill I\u2019d planned to use for snacks, trying to keep my expression neutral.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got no wallet?\u201d he growled, his face darkening. My brain screamed at me to do something\u2014anything\u2014before this escalated further.\nThen, a desperate thought flashed through my mind. The Arabs in this area had a well-known fear of Russians, with frequent clashes between the two groups. Maybe\u2026 just maybe, I could use this.\nIn a heavy Russian accent, I stammered, \u201cMy friends have my wallet. They\u2019re coming soon\u2014we meet here.\u201d\nTo my surprise, their poor English comprehension worked in my favor. They exchanged glances, muttering in German, and decided to wait. I forced myself to look confused, maintaining the bluff.\nIt worked. Their effort to translate or figure me out must have seemed too much trouble. The leader finally pointed at my \u20ac5 bill. \u201cAlright then, you get us something to drink.\u201d\nReluctantly, I followed them into the Sp\u00e4ti. They grabbed a six-pack of Coke, and I paid, heart pounding. I was certain this wasn\u2019t over\u2014that they\u2019d either search me themselves or retaliate when my nonexistent \u201cfriends\u201d didn\u2019t show up.\nBut then, just like that, they left.\nNo violence, no further questions\u2014nothing. I stood there in shock, unable to process what had just happened.\nLooking back, I can\u2019t believe I bluffed in such a dangerous situation.

Among the tales of\u00a0Kota's past, one stands out\u2014the story of Mr. Burton, a British colonial officer\u00a0whose life and legacy are shrouded in darkness. From whispers of occult practices to unsolved murders,\u00a0Mr. Burton\u2019s presence in Kota has left an indelible mark on the city's history.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn this blog, we will explore the life of\u00a0Mr. Burton,\u00a0the shadowy events that unfolded during his tenure, and the haunting impact they continue to have on\u00a0Kota's\u00a0identity.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Mysterious Mr. Burton\u00a0\u00a0\nMr. Burton,\u00a0an officer\u00a0in the British colonial administration,\u00a0was stationed in Kota\u00a0during the early\u00a020th century.\u00a0The British Raj was at its peak,\u00a0and Kota,\u00a0with its strategic location and historical significance, was an important administrative center.\u00a0Records indicate that Mr. Burton was a disciplined officer,\u00a0entrusted with maintaining order in the region.\u00a0\u00a0\nHowever,\u00a0his official duties were overshadowed by rumors and allegations\u00a0that hinted at a darker side to his personality.\u00a0Locals describe him as a recluse, often seen wandering the city's outskirts late at night.\u00a0He had few interactions with the native population, and those\u00a0who did meet him spoke of his piercing gaze and unsettling demeanor.\u00a0\u00a0\nWho was Mr. Burton?\u00a0Was he merely a misunderstood man living in a foreign land, or\u00a0was there truth to the rumors that painted him as a sinister figure?\u00a0\u00a0\nKota\u2019s Historical Backdrop\nTo understand\u00a0Mr. Burton\u2019s story,\u00a0we must first delve into the\u00a0historical context of Kota.\u00a0The city,\u00a0founded in the 17th century,\u00a0had long been a\u00a0battleground for power struggles.\u00a0During the British era, Kota was a princely state under the suzerainty of the Raj.\u00a0The city bore witness to social and political upheavals, as traditional structures clashed with colonial governance.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe early 20th century\u00a0was a time of\u00a0great turmoil for Kota. The economy was strained by British taxation policies,\u00a0and tensions simmered between the ruling elites and the common people. Against this backdrop of unrest,\u00a0Mr. Burton\u2019s arrival marked the beginning of a series of events that would plunge the city into a period of fear and uncertainty.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Occult Connection\nPerhaps the most controversial aspect of Mr. Burton\u2019s legacy is his\u00a0alleged involvement\u00a0in the\u00a0occult.\u00a0Local legends suggest that he was a member of a\u00a0secret society\u00a0that practiced\u00a0dark rituals, including black magic and human sacrifice.\u00a0These rituals were said to take place in\u00a0hidden chambers\u00a0beneath his residence, away from\u00a0prying eyes.\u00a0\u00a0\nOne particularly persistent rumor describes how\u00a0strange symbols\u00a0were often seen painted near his home. These symbols, which locals claim were linked to\u00a0ancient occult practices,\u00a0were said to invoke\u00a0fear and unease\u00a0among the city's residents.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhile no\u00a0concrete evidence\u00a0of such activities exists, the stories have endured for\u00a0generations.\u00a0Historians believe that these tales may have been\u00a0exaggerated over time,\u00a0blending\u00a0colonial distrust\u00a0with native folklore. Yet, the very mention of\u00a0Mr. Burton\u2019s name\u00a0continues to send\u00a0shivers\u00a0down the spines of those familiar with his story.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Murders That Shook Kota\nDuring\u00a0Mr. Burton\u2019s tenure,\u00a0a series of\u00a0brutal murders rocked Kota.\u00a0The victims, mostly\u00a0local\u00a0villagers,\u00a0were found with\u00a0strange symbols\u00a0carved into their bodies, eerily similar to those associated with\u00a0occult practices.\u00a0The killings were gruesome, with evidence suggesting they were carried out with\u00a0precision and purpose.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe murders sparked\u00a0widespread panic,\u00a0and many began to\u00a0point fingers at Mr. Burton.\u00a0His\u00a0reclusive nature\u00a0and the eerie stories surrounding him made him an\u00a0easy target for suspicion.\u00a0Yet, the\u00a0British administration\u00a0dismissed these claims, citing a\u00a0lack of evidence.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe truth behind these murders remains a\u00a0mystery.\u00a0Were they the work of a\u00a0deranged killer,\u00a0or did they have deeper, more\u00a0sinister connections\u00a0to the\u00a0occult practices\u00a0rumored to involve\u00a0Mr. Burton?\u00a0\u00a0\nEyewitness Accounts and Folklore\nOver the years, numerous\u00a0eyewitness accounts\u00a0have emerged, adding layers of intrigue to the story of\u00a0Mr. Burton.\u00a0An\u00a0elderly resident\u00a0of Kota once claimed to have seen\u00a0strange lights\u00a0emanating from Mr. Burton\u2019s residence late at night. Another described hearing\u00a0unearthly chants\u00a0that seemed to echo through the stillness of the city.\u00a0\u00a0\nFolklore has also played a significant role in shaping Mr. Burton\u2019s legacy. Stories of his\u00a0ghost\u00a0haunting the\u00a0old colonial bungalow\u00a0where he once lived are common. Some claim to have seen his\u00a0spectral figure,\u00a0dressed in a\u00a0colonial uniform,\u00a0wandering the streets of Kota under the cover of\u00a0darkness.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Legacy of Mr. Burton\nToday, Mr. Burton\u2019s story is both a source of\u00a0fascination and a cautionary tale.\u00a0While some dismiss the rumors as mere\u00a0folklore, others view them as a reflection of the\u00a0deep-seated anxieties\u00a0and fears of the colonial era. His name has become synonymous with\u00a0Kota\u2019s dark history,\u00a0a reminder of the\u00a0shadows\u00a0that once loomed over the city.\u00a0\u00a0\nKota has come a long way since the days of\u00a0Mr. Burton.\u00a0It is now a\u00a0thriving urban center,\u00a0known for its\u00a0educational institutions and cultural heritage.\u00a0Yet, the stories of its past continue to\u00a0intrigue\u00a0residents and visitors alike.\u00a0\u00a0\nA Reflection on Myth and History\nThe tale of\u00a0Mr. Burton\u00a0highlights the fine line between\u00a0history and myth.\u00a0While the lack of\u00a0concrete evidence\u00a0leaves much of his story open to\u00a0interpretation, it also underscores the\u00a0power of storytelling\u00a0in shaping\u00a0collective memory.\u00a0\u00a0\nKota\u2019s dark past serves as a reminder of the\u00a0human tendency\u00a0to create\u00a0narratives\u00a0that explain the\u00a0inexplicable.\u00a0Whether Mr. Burton was a\u00a0villain, a\u00a0victim of circumstance,\u00a0or merely a figment of\u00a0exaggerated imagination,\u00a0his story remains an\u00a0integral part\u00a0of Kota\u2019s\u00a0cultural identity.\u00a0\u00a0\nConclusion\nMr. Burton\u2019s story is a\u00a0haunting chapter\u00a0in Kota\u2019s history, a blend of\u00a0fact, folklore, and fear\u00a0that continues to capture the\u00a0imagination.\u00a0As we uncover the secrets of his life, we must also remember the\u00a0broader historical and cultural context\u00a0that gave rise to such tales.\u00a0\u00a0\nKota, like many cities with a\u00a0rich and complex past,\u00a0carries the\u00a0weight of its history.\u00a0By reflecting on stories like that of\u00a0Mr. Burton,\u00a0we honor the memories of those who lived through those times and ensure that the\u00a0lessons of history\u00a0are never forgotten.\u00a0\u00a0", "media": null, "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comment_count": 0, "over_18": false}, "31": {"id": "1h1dseu", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ghosts", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Quirky_Scar7857", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1732936061.0450954, "created_utc": 1732738545.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/1h1dseu/saw_the_ghost_of_my_wifes_dog_last_night_it/", "title": "Saw the ghost of my wife's dog last night. it brought me comfort but I wish my wife had seen it too.

It was December 26th and me and my sister had just visited our grandparents who live at a farm in remote Finnish countryside. It was not particularly late, perhaps around seven in the evening, but this being the north, the road was pitch black and there were no streetlights. \nMy sister was focused on driving carefully, as you never knew when a deer might jump out on the road, but I was looking around at the side of the road which was only lit by the headlights of the car. Suddenly, I saw a shape of a slightly unnaturally tall man standing perfectly still at the side of the road, simply staring blankly ahead while remaining still. The humanoid figure seemed to pay no attention to us or the car.\nThe very moment I saw the humanoid figure, my lizard brain sensed danger, I almost jumped on my seat, and my heart started beating extremely rapidly. I had never experienced that sort of sudden visceral fear before and my sudden reaction freaked out my sister who was driving. I quickly looked back and the figure was still there, but very quickly it became too dark to see. \nThis was a very remote road with multiple kilometres to the nearest farms and there were no street lights. In theory it is not impossible for a tall person to have been walking in the area and stopping to let the car pass, but this was but there were no houses anywhere close, it was a pitch dark road, and the temperatures were freezing. The way the humanoid was just blankly staring ahead was also very unnatural. \nI don't know what I saw, but it reminded me of Finnish and Scandinavian folk lore and a creature called \"nuuttipukki\" or \"kekripukki\", which resembles a northern Scandinavian version of Krampus. The season would match. However, while I didn't see the humanoid for very long, it did not seem very goat-like, although it did seem to be around two metres tall.

If this post disappears, you'll know why.\nSince elementary school, I've noticed patterns in my luck. I could predict when I'd get good grades(during the \"designated good grades\"semesters, minimal effort would yield high scores. But in semesters marked for poor performance, no amount of effort would improve my grades) or when my dad would lose his temper. Back then, I used to picturing someone sitting at a control panel, flipping a \"luck switch\" repeatedly that affected my childhood life.\nI often find myself shouting into thin air furiously, demanding answers: \"What do you want? I'm not your puppet! When will you leave me alone?\" It feels like my entire life is a script written by this force, and I'm just an actor with no real control. When I do things it \"permits,\" everything goes smoothly. But when I go against its will, I face obstacles and prepare to face punishment to prevent me from doing it again.\nHere's a recent example: Last year, I had a severe cold and went to the clinic. Everything was fine until exactly my turn to see the doctor - suddenly, the computers lost power despite that level still having electricity. So I had to wait a bit longer. This wasn't an isolated incident; similar \"technical issues\" have happened multiple times when I've tried to see doctors.I can see that it doesn\u2019t like me seeing doctors. Another time was the print machine broke down. Once is bad luck, but a series of coincidences? That\u2019s possibility multiplying, That's deliberate.\nThe hospital incidents are just one small part of this. If I were to create a Venn diagram of all the strange \"coincidences\" and manipulations I've experienced, it would be incredibly complex.\nI guess The hospital incident is a still-going thread, there are so much to share.\nAs a child in elementary and junior high school, I simply observed and followed these patterns. Later, I tried to actively manipulate them to achieve desired outcomes, though it remained challenging.\n(Not sure if anyone will believe this, but I needed to share.)\nEdit: Might have to delete this if \"it\" doesn't approve.

I was abused, alone and hardly had friends because i wasnt allowed to hangout with my friends except in school. I discovered Omegle as most teens did in the mid 2010s. I met a guy from MO and he claimed to be 20, his name is Noble. We talk and my birth giver found out and kept making steps to keep me from talking to him but i was stubborn and thought he loved me. So our relationship goes on as im taken from my home and put in a Safe house to protect me from being exploited. The thing is i still had access to a cell phone, wifi and anything on the internet. So Noble and i keep talking and i find out he is not in fact 20 but he is 31. I was delusional and was like \u201coh thats fine\u201d because again, i believed he loved me and only he loved me. Lots of in and out of youth homeless shelters and programs and I was then placed back with my birth giver for a short amount of time but was taken again and given to my bio father. Who then also proceeds to find out about this man and try and prevent me from talking to him. It worked for a while as i was in therapy and on meds. After we moved i was taken off my meds and out of therapy and i started acting up and reaching out to him again. Well i was removed from my bio fathers home due to his and my behaviors and i was placed in a group home. Im now 15, My third week there i ranaway and told Noble to come pick me up. He drove 16 hours as i stayed hidden in some random ladies house i met at a gas station. He arrives and we start heading back to MO. While we are in PA (driving from southern tier NY) im playing on his phone and i see he got repeated messages from a few girls accounts on snapchat. I ask about it and he comes clean that he had been doing the same thing with other girls that he does with me (nudes, calls, etc). i start crying and telling him to either bring me back or drop me off on the side of the road and ill find my way back. He tells me no and proceeds to pull over and choke me until im unconscious (im 5\u20196 111 lbs and anorexic at the time and hes 200 something lbs and 5\u201910ish) idk how long i was out but it was long enough for him to find a hotel, check us in and get me in the room without someone noticing. I woke up to him on top of me raping me. The rest of the trip was kind of a blur but we end up finally reaching his apartment and i asked to see his phone so i could play a game, his dumbass gave me the phone and i texted my grandma and my birth giver on messenger saying i loved them and if they didnt hear from me i was in MO. \nAfter multiple times of being graped, forced to take pictures for other disgusting individuals and forced to act like i was happy so i could live, like the meme minus the yelling FBI, the FBI and MO state police bust down the door and handcuff him, take me to a car and take him to another one. They took all his computers, harddrives etc and i was brought to the juvie, then transferred to the mental ward for weeks then back to juvie (ward of the state and i said i wanted to die bc of all of this happening). instead of being treated like a kid who was groomed and raped and kidnapped i was treated like a criminal. I was in MO for a month before i was put on a plane and sent back to NY where i was quickly put into residential. He was sentenced to 30 years for what he did to me and other girls my age. \nI tell this story now because he randomly found my instagram and started trying to reach out to me again from prison. I told him he was disgusting, i wasnt a naive kid anymore and that he needs to leave me alone. He got the memo the first time thank fuck but he shouldve NEVER been able to reach out. I keep my eye on where he goes but it seems hes either working his years off or hes been getting less time somehow because his years dropped from 30 to 26 that he needs to serve. \nSo Noble if youre on your little prison tablet and somehow on this subreddit, i hope we never meet again.\nEdit: spelling and wording ", "media": null, "score": 145, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "comment_count": 34, "over_18": true}, "45": {"id": "1gzl7sm", "locked": false, "subreddit": "truecreepy", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "happypants69", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1732936071.3397555, "created_utc": 1732547996.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/67yj65xke23e1.jpeg", "title": "60-Year-Old Wells Fargo Worker Died At Her Desk And Was Found Four Days Later By Colleagues Due To Foul Odor", "permalink": "/r/truecreepy/comments/1gzl7sm/60yearold_wells_fargo_worker_died_at_her_desk_and/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 28, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "comment_count": 2, "over_18": false}, "46": {"id": "1h1sfsy", "locked": false, "subreddit": "threekings", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Significant_Yak5400", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1732936071.5203743, "created_utc": 1732786828.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/threekings/comments/1h1sfsy/kashima_reiko_is_it_real/", "title": "Kashima Reiko, is it real?!", "permalink": "/r/threekings/comments/1h1sfsy/kashima_reiko_is_it_real/", "selftext": "Kashima Reiko was a woman who was viciously attacked by a group of men in a public restroom and left to die.

The US was capped at a certain amount of Nuclear Weapons they could have in the UK. That cap was lifted 13 days ago or something similar. I think what we are seeing is one of the largest transfers of Nuclear weapons in history. \nI have no idea the timeline as to when they started to alter the treaty but something tells me the Biden Administration wants to disperse their Nuclear weapons to trusted allies before the Trump Admin comes into power and other reasons. Most, if not almost all drones are probably US/UK stuff that's not to say that E.T's are not watching this very closely if not interfering or making themselves known in some manner as UFO's and Nukes go hand in hand and its also possible that some of the activity is Russian and Chinese actors using their own drones to try and surveil this massive movement of Nuclear weapons. That is why the U.S military spokesman said \"We don't know where or who they are, We know they are no harm\" he will obfuscate the truth completely in the first part of the sentence but will tell the truth in the last part and it explains why the US and the UK are not reacting to the apparent threat because its their own gear.\nRussia and the U.S mutually do not want this transfer and policy change to be broadcast openly. Putin would be forced to escalate to not appear weak infront of his country and he has limited options at this point. The U.S doesn't need to broadcast this either as it would be seen as saber rattling and the effect is to strengthen the UK, Russia will know about the transfer and the U.S wants russia to know that going forward even if the U.S were to completely capitulate to Russia the UK will have enough weapons for Mutually Assured Destruction. This is a insurance policy for the US/UK and the free world if the US democracy doesn't survive trump and the U.S leadership becomes vassals to russian leadership and we can no longer rely on the United States to counter Russia(which news flash happened for 4 years under trump's last presidency but now we are in a literal world war).\nIt takes 10-15 days for a military cargo ship to sail from the US to the UK. They probably had the Nukes ready to ship but couldn't go underway until the treaty was alterations were ratified officially which fits into the timeline with all the activity going on 14 days after the treaty changes.\nThis is from the House of Commons in the UK, look at how the start off by saying \" Many of the proposed changes are minor technical amendments relating to outdated language, definitions and terminology\"\nlike its not a major policy change, then the below points are essentially saying \"we cannot rely on the US anymore you are too politically unstable so the Nukes you keep here are actually our nukes now and even if you want them back tough luck\". \nhttps://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-10086/\nhttps://www.state.gov/united-states-and-united-kingdom-bring-amendment-to-mutual-defense-agreement-into-force/\n(This was all copy and pasted from a email I sent last sorry for any errors or formatting issues", "media": null, "score": 603, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "comment_count": 107, "over_18": false}, "50": {"id": "1h1df1c", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ufos", "stickied": false, "category": "Aliens", "author": "sdubs76", "link_flair_text": "News", "time": 1732936074.8889325, "created_utc": 1732737621.0, "url": "https://v.redd.it/zz2y2m2d2i3e1", "title": "At RAF Lakenheath NOW", "permalink": "/r/UFOs/comments/1h1df1c/at_raf_lakenheath_now/", "selftext": "Curiosity got the better of me and drove about 45 mins from home.

The Russian city of Voronezh is an industrial hub located about 300 miles from Moscow. The city has a population of nearly one million and hardly seems like the kind of isolated region that is ordinarily associated with strange alien encounters, yet on the evening of September 27, 1989, at about 6:30 pm., it became the host of what strikes many as being one of the most unusual, not to mention horrifying, encounters with creatures ever recorded. Eyewitnesses reported that on the evening in question a glowing, deep red, ovoid object \u2014 which they estimated to be approximately 45-feet wide and 18-feet high \u2014 circled above an area known as Levoberezhniy\u2019s park. Witnesses swore that the \u201cvehicle\u201d hovered less than 40-feet above ground, close enough to disturb the grass below. Then, just as suddenly as it had arrived, the UFO soared away, leaving the eyewitnesses perplexed and no doubt more than a little relieved.\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e2jq2o9wwv2e1.jpg?width=220&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d040f69aee1d7f272c9e54b21dfeec2bbda15493\nThat was until the strange craft returned just minutes later. It hovered near a group of grade-school children; including Vasya Surin, Julia Sholokhova, Lena Sarokina, Alyosha Nikonov and Vova Startsev \u2013 who were engaged in a soccer match. But it wasn\u2019t only children who saw the UFO. It was also spotted by 35 to 40 adults who were waiting at a nearby bus stop on Poutiline St. Both the kids and adults were awed by the spectacle before them and utterly unprepared for what they were about to see next.\nAccording to eyewitness accounts, a hatch on the underside of the still hovering craft opened to reveal an odd, long-armed, neck-less, thick-set, 9-foot tall entity with a small, knob-like head. The creature was clad in a silver jumpsuit with bronze boots and was so large it appeared to fill the hatch opening. As if the creature\u2019s immensity wasn\u2019t disturbing enough, eyewitnesses claimed that there were three luminous eyes wedged into its tiny, dome-like head. The being\u2019s two outer eyes were whitish and the center eye \u2014 which was set slightly above the other two \u2014 was bright red and \u201cswiveling around like a radar.\u201d They also claimed that the alien had a disk-like object attached to its chest. This bizarre being seemed to methodically scan the terrain below, then sealed the hatch. Then the UFO made its descent. Eyewitnesses stated that the object\u2019s weight was so substantial that it permanently bent to the side a standing poplar tree that was near the craft.\nThe object then hovered about 5-feet off the ground and extended four leg-like supports and landed softly on the grass. At this point, the alien that was seen through the open hatch now emerged from the ship followed by two equally colossal creatures that shared the same three-eyed visages. These extraordinary entities walked with a \u201cheavy gait\u201d and were followed by what witnesses described as a box-like robot, with push buttons on its front side. An alien adjusted one of the controls on the robot\u2019s chest, enabling it to walk about in a \u201cmechanical\u201d fashion. The entities then began to examine the ground near where their craft had landed and proceeded to take some soil samples. One of the creatures made indecipherable sounds, which some eyewitnesses perceived to be orders. Then a beam of light emerged from the \u201cchief\u201d alien\u2019s chest. The beam delineated a number of luminous triangles and rectangles \u2014 about 1-foot by half a foot wide \u2014 as if indicating something to its comrades. This frightened one young man so much he apparently cried out in alarm. At the sound the lead alien apparently fixed its gaze on the youngster, freezing him unnaturally in his tracks. This sent panic rippling through the rest of the terrified crowd and \u2014 as if this tale could get any weirder \u2014 witnesses claim that the aliens and the UFO all simultaneously disappeared. Nevertheless, this encounter was far from over.\nApproximately five minutes later, the remaining witnesses, still stunned by what they had witnessed, were once again thrust back into the looking glass as the UFO and its occupants instantaneously reappeared at the same coordinates. One of the creatures was now carrying a \u201ctube\u201d that was about a foot in length. It aimed the tube toward a 16-year-old boy who was nearby and a beam shot out, causing the teen to disappear without a trace. Before a terror filled riot could ensue, the creatures re-entered the UFO. It retracted its landing gear and began its ascent, slowly increasing its speed. Just as the vehicle was disappearing from sight, the vaporized teen miraculously reappeared. Of course, it wasn't long before the press got wind of this harrowing and utterly bizarre tale of UFOs, robots, vanishing \u201cguns\u201d and gargantuan alien invaders. Genrikh Silanov, head of the Voronezh Geophysical Laboratory, first reported the case and \u2014 in a reflection of the new era of glasnost \u2014 the Soviet news agency TASS published a report about the event. Soon the story spread across the globe like wildfire.\nIn no time, scores of scientists, Soviet Government agencies and reporters descended upon the city of Voronezh. Those interviewed claimed they had observed this UFO, not just during the incident in question, but also many times between the dates of September 21 and October 2, 1989. An investigation at the scene of the landing indicated that there were depressions in the ground in the shape of a large rhombus that must have been caused by something weighing several tons, but there were conflicting reports as to their cause. Scientists also allegedly found anomalies in the local magnetic field and background radiation, though these findings have also been disputed. Silanov further claimed that unearthly substances were found at the scene: At first glance, they looked like sandstone of a deep-red color. However, mineralogical analysis has shown that the substance cannot be found on Earth. However, additional tests are needed to reach a more definite conclusion.\u201d\nOther reputable witnesses included Lieutenant Sergei A. Matveyev who confessed that while he had not actually seen the aliens, he had seen the spaceship, which he described as \u201ca body flying in the sky,\u201d moving silently at a very high speed and very low altitude. Lieutenant Matveyev claimed that even he was a little skeptical when he first saw the object: \u201dI thought I must be really tired, \u2018but I rubbed my eyes and it didn't go away. Then I figured, in this day and age, anything is possible.\u201d Vladimir A. Moiseyev, director of the regional health department, claimed that his primary concern was that of the health of the children who may have been exposed to unknown pathogens or radiation due to their contact with the aliens and their technology.\nJournalist E. Efremov, of the Sovietskaya Kultura, spoke of the veracity of the eyewitness accounts: \u201dChildren and eyewitnesses of the abnormal phenomenon have been questioned by police workers and journalists\u2026 there are no discrepancies in the description of the sphere itself or the actions of the \u2018aliens.\u2019 Moreover, all the children who became witnesses to this event are still afraid, even now.\u201d Following the event, the children \u2014 including 6th grader Roma Torshin and Genya Bilinov \u2014 were encouraged to draw the beings they had seen, with results that even skeptics had to admit were surprisingly consistent with what had been reported by the children and adults alike. Even today debates rage in ufological circles concerning this odd incident.\nWhile many seem convinced that this account is an obvious hoax, there are others who feel that this may be Russia\u2019s equivalent of the now notorious Roswell UFO Incident. Perhaps the truth lies somewhere in between, but it would seem that even in 1989 \u2014 during a relatively open juncture in the exceedingly clandestine history of the USSR \u2014 Soviet secrets were still kept close to the vest. In the years following this largely forgotten incident, there has grown an almost cult affection for the odd creatures that allegedly visited Levoberezhniy\u2019s park that chilly autumn evening, even spawning a line of Japanese toys. Whatever these entities were they\u2019ve never returned, leaving the rest of the world to speculate as to whether or not these creatures were a hoax, explorers from another world, interdimensional travelers or advanced scouts for an alien invasion\u2026 perhaps we\u2019ll be luckier if we never know.", "media": null, "score": 46, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comment_count": 5, "over_18": false}, "58": {"id": "1h1srpl", "locked": false, "subreddit": "cryptids", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "mistahfunniman", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1732936080.558541, "created_utc": 1732788265.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/p9485m5y8m3e1.png", "title": "I feel bad for Ningen because in most pictures hes just wandering around cluelessly with no goal, can somebody please get this guy home?", "permalink": "/r/cryptids/comments/1h1srpl/i_feel_bad_for_ningen_because_in_most_pictures/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 567, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comment_count": 32, "over_18": false}, "59": {"id": "1gxt8tv", "locked": false, "subreddit": "thetruthishere", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Magellan_8888", "link_flair_text": "Discussion/Advice", "time": 1732936080.818625, "created_utc": 1732342917.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1gxt8tv/had_a_very_serious_out_of_the_blue_period_of/", "title": "Had a very serious, out of the blue period of grief 2 days before the passing of a local student I knew", "permalink": "/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1gxt8tv/had_a_very_serious_out_of_the_blue_period_of/", "selftext": "*Warning* this post mentions death and self harm. please read at your own discretion.\nI'm 22m and have experienced a variety of \"crazy coincidences\" throughout my life, but this has got to be the weirdest.\nOn Tuesday, I was doing homework and happened upon the song \"mercy street\" by peter gabriel. the song is quite melancholy, and it made me unusually sad.

She was so gorgeous, confident, smart, effortlessly stylish, and always owning the room. Back then, I was too shy to talk to her. Seniors are already pretty intimidating to freshmen, but Alyssa was next-level intimidating because she was such a queen!\nI didn\u2019t expect anyone to see me the way I saw Alyssa, but I was pleasantly surprised in my senior year.\nIn my senior year, I started finding cute little notes in my locker. I wasn\u2019t expecting that at all, but I was really flattered. The first one said:\n\n\u201cYou were beautiful in that dress on Friday \u2661\u201d\n\nThe handwriting was neat and simple with a cute little heart at the end.\nMore notes kept coming, always in fourth period. I got a note every week or two. I know they came during fourth period because I checked my locker before and after every class. They were all really sweet. They said things like this:\n\n\u201cYour smile lights up the hallway!\u201d\n\u201cYou shine brighter than any star!\"\n\"Your homecoming photos are straight out of a magazine cover! So stunning!\"\n\nThere were more notes that I don\u2019t remember. They weren\u2019t romantic or flirty. They looked like things I might have said to Alyssa if we'd ever spoken. I thought maybe they were from a shy underclassman girl. I had my suspicions.\nI didn\u2019t tell anyone about the notes. I really didn\u2019t want my friends turning this into an investigation and embarrassing whoever was leaving them. Whoever was leaving these messages, I thought they meant well.\nThen in the second semester, my schedule changed. My last class of the day was upstairs near my friend\u2019s locker. My friend\u2019s last class was near my locker. We swapped lockers.\nI forgot all about the notes until my 18th birthday. That morning, my friend handed me a note she found in her (my old) locker. It said \u201cHappy birthday, princess.\u201d\nAt first, she thought the notes were meant for her since any of those compliments could fit her too. But when she realized the birthday didn\u2019t match up, she put two and two together.\nCome to think of it, I don\u2019t think any of the notes ever said my name.\nI admitted that the notes had been happening all year and explained that I didn\u2019t want to make a big deal about it.\nThen my friends launched their investigation that I had been worried about! All the girls in our friend group became detectives trying to solve this mystery. One friend, who didn\u2019t have a fourth-period class, stationed herself by the lockers to surveil that area. That worked.\nThe notes weren\u2019t from a shy freshman or even from a boy. They were from a janitor, an older woman none of us knew. We all recognized her, but I don't think any of us had ever talked to her. She\u2019d been leaving these notes for several months, watching me closely enough to comment on my outfits, field hockey games, and even what I posted on Facebook!\nI saw her at the last field hockey game of the season. She sat quietly in the stands. That was the only time I noticed her watching me, but I have no idea how places I didn't notice her watching me.\nNone of us brought this up to her.

It wasn't. he then searched everywhere on his property in his house everywhere. Nothing, he could not determine who made the footprints or where they went. Weeks leading up to this incident,  Kreszenz Rieger, the family maid abruptly quit. It was later found out she claimed hearing stranger noises coming from the attic. She believed the house to be haunted. \nOn the afternoon of Friday March 31, 1922, a new maid arrived at the Hinterkaifeck farm. Maria Baumgartner had been escorted to Hinterkaifeck by her sister, who left the farm after a brief stay. It was likely that Baumgartner\u2019s sister was the last person to see the Gruber family and her sister alive. A few days go by and No one hears from the Gruber family. Saturday and Monday, little Cecilia was supposed to attend her school, but she didn't show up to. and on Sundays, none of her family members went to church. On Tuesday April 4th, a mechanic visited the farm and spent a few hours fixing farm equipment, but none of the family came out. When the repairman thought it was strange and told the villagers of Kaypek, the villagers also wondered, The family of Hinterkaifek Farm are nowhere to be seen.\nAt some point during the night of March 31st. Andreas and his wife C\u00e4zilia, along with their daughter Viktoria and granddaughter C\u00e4zilia, were lured away from the house one at a time to the barn, where they were attacked and murdered.

The killer then went into the family's house, and using the same  weapon, killed the youngest son Josef, while he slept as well as Baumgartner, who was found in her bedroom. The bodies of the family and their maid would remain undiscovered over the next four days. The day after the murders, April 1st at around 3:30pm, Lorenz Schlittenbauer sent his sixteen-year-old son Johann to the Hinterkaifeck farm to see if they could find the whereabouts of the Gruber family. He eventually returned home and reported he hadn't seen anyone at the Hinterkaifeck farm. Schlittenbauer headed to the farm the same day in the company of Michael Pl\u00f6ckl and Jakob Sigl. The three men entered the barn and there found the  bodies of Andreas Gruber, his wife C\u00e4zilia Gruber, his daughter Viktoria Gabriel, and his granddaughter C\u00e4zilia. Schlittenbauer stacked on top of each other, he then went into the house alone shortly afterwards, and there found the maid, Maria Baumgartner, and the youngest family member, Josef, murdered inside the house. The victims in the barn suffered horrendous injuries. C\u00e4cilia Gruber was found to have eight holes in the right side of her skull, while her daughter Viktoria\u2019s skull was found to have nine holes after being hit repeatedly on the right side of her head.\nBoth of the murder weapons  belonged to Andreas Gruber, who suffered significantly different injuries to the other members of his family. He was found to have died from a fall onto the tip of the heavy pickaxe, which was found in the animal feeding trough. This wound tore open his carotid artery, causing him to bleed to death within a very short time. The flesh was torn open on the right side of his cheek and the cheekbone protruded. He only had this one injury. Detectives believe the killer had remained in the house for three days with bodies of the victims, and despite a thorough investigation, this gruesome crime remains unsolved to this day.\nThe police set about questioning eye-witnesses who came forward with information. One such person questioned was artisan Michael Pl\u00f6ckl. In an interview with Michael, he States he would walk past the Hinterkaifecker's property every morning and evening as he went to and from work. According to Michael, On Friday night March 31st around 9:00 o'clock, as he was returning from work, he was illuminated with a lantern by a man who was coming towards him from a field near Hinterkaifeck. This man, whom he did not know very well, then jumped back into the field without saying anything. As Pl\u00f6ckl told me, the figure of the man matched that of Lorenz  Schlittenbauer.\nAs he continued walking, Pl\u00f6ckl noticed that there must have been a fire in the Hinterkaifecker's oven because he saw smoke rising. This smoke had a disgusting smell, as if old rags were being burned. Pl\u00f6ckl also told me that that evening, or rather, on that night, the inhabitants of the Kaifeck were killed, at least that night was described by the homicide squad as the night of murder. Pl\u00f6ckl said  \"I am convinced that Schlittenbauer burned his blood-stained clothes in the oven that evening\". For many years people speculated that Schlittenbauer murdered the family after Viktoria demanded financial support for young Josef. Before his death in 1941, Schlittenbauer initiated and won several civil claims for slander against those people who described him as the \u201cmurderer of Hinterkaifeck\u201d. If Schlittenbauer had knowledge of who committed the Hinterkaifeck murders, he took the secret with him to the grave.   \n( Thank you guys for reading I hope you enjoyed it, I spent a whole day reading and watching documentaries and what not on this story.

The enthralled boys stared in awe as the larger of the two objects broke off and flew toward Mt. Atago, while the smaller one slowly descended to the ground, landing amongst the crops of a vineyard behind the estate. The boys later stated that the strange aerial objects emitted an odd crackling or \u201cticking\u201d sound, not unlike that of a Geiger counter.\nIt goes without saying that the curious youngsters wasted no time in removing their skates and charging into the vineyard in order to get a better look at this now earthbound object. As the two 2nd Graders approached the formerly orange \u201cspace craft\" they saw that it was actually a domed, silverish disc, which stood approximately 7-feet high and was almost 15-feet in diameter. This classically shaped flying saucer was perched on \u201cthree ball-shaped legs\u201d and had what the children described as \u201cstrange characters\u201d embossed on the metallic surface of its hull. While inspecting the craft, both Kawano and Yamahata were astounded \u2014 and no doubt a bit frightened \u2014 to see a hatch open on the side of the craft and a ladder automatically extending down to the ground below. The boys watched in stunned silence as a bizarre humanoid creature disembarked from the ship. It was at that moment that the boys noticed another \u2014 smaller, though similar looking \u2014 humanoid that remained inside the control room. Kawano and Yamahata reported that the first creature was long-armed, almost 4-feet tall and was clad in a \u201cglowing\u201d or reflective silver uniform.\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gend2i9r693e1.jpg?width=180&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2d12cf709c5c3f795cd39f99a16f45ab1967bc6e\nUnlike the\u00a0Kinnula Humanoid\u00a0\u2014 which was clad head to foot in a deep sea diver-like, green suit \u2014 the Kofu entity\u2019s skin was described as being dark brown and covered in wrinkles so dense that they obscured any noticeable features; save three, two-inch long, metal \u201cfangs.\u201d While the silvery fangs are a new twist, the wrinkly skin might ring a bell for those who have heard of the\u00a0Pascagoula Elephant Men. This strange alien sightseer apparently began to explore the terrain, seemingly oblivious to the enthralled duo staring at it. That was until it abruptly turned and placed one of its \u201chands\u201d on Yamahata\u2019s shoulder, patting him twice and uttering a series of sounds that sounded to the boys: \u201clike a tape recorder running backwards.\u201d At this point Yamahata collapsed to the ground, paralyzed.\nAlthough his friend believed that this was caused by fear, anyone familiar with so-called close encounters of the 3rd kind can attest that human beings are often placed in a state of almost suspended animation by extra-terrestrial visitors in, what one must assume, is an effort to prevent them from hurting themselves or anyone else. As soon as Yamahata dropped, Kawano \u2014 exhibiting a commendable bout of courage for one so young \u2014 rapidly pulled his friend up onto his shoulders and lugged him away from these vampiric alien assailants as swiftly as possible. Upon returning home, the now almost hysterical boys immediately informed their mothers about this bizarre close encounter. Their curious \u2014 yet almost certainly incredulous \u2014 mothers followed their clearly perturbed sons to the back of the Hinode Housing Estate, where, much to their shock, they confirmed seeing an orange light pulsating in the vineyard. This odd light show continued for five minutes. Before the boys could convince their mothers to investigate the strange craft at a closer range, the UFO launched with a burst of light so brilliant the eyewitnesses were compelled to avert their eyes.\nIt should be noted that while Yamahata and Kawano were the only ones to have actually seen the aliens, their classmate \u2014 8-year-old, Ichiro Minegishi \u2014 also reported that he saw a shining object flying toward the Hinode Housing Estate while he was riding in a car with his parents near the K\u014dfu Bypass, approximately one half-hour before the boys claimed to have discovered the UFO. The following day, Kawano and Yamahata had a captivated audience of students and teachers at the Yamashiro Elementary School, as they drew pictures and retold the harrowing tale of their alien encounter. It wasn\u2019t long before the buzz enveloped the entire school and the educational authorities \u2014 with what, at least in the 21st Century, seems to be uncharacteristic open-mindedness \u2014 decided that they would inspect the area for themselves.\nThe school officials arrived armed with whatever gear they could get hold of and immediately noticed that two solid concrete posts had been \u201cpushed over\u201d at the landing site. It was determined that the boys would have been unable to accomplish this task of ostensibly intergalactic vandalism on their own. This investigative team also found what they referred to as \u201clanding traces\u201d as well as a ring pattern in the soil near the broken concrete posts where the UFO landed. One schoolteacher even claimed to have discovered radioactivity within the circular patch. Following the event, both boys were questioned in depth by their parents, their schoolmaster, Nobuyoshi Kaneko, and noted UFO investigator Masaru Mori \u2014 their stories remained alarmingly consistent.\nUnsurprisingly, the authorities of the Civil Aviation Bureau of the Transportation Ministry claimed that the UFO was nothing more than the lights of a YS-11 propeller plane, which often flew at an altitude of a thousand meters and was visible to the naked eye. They apparently reserved comment as to whether or not this aircraft could also assume the form of small, pointy eared, fanged humanoids.\n----------------\nLink: https://cryptidz.fandom.com/wiki/Kofu_Fanged_Humanoids", "media": null, "score": 12, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comment_count": 0, "over_18": false}, "73": {"id": "1gyh9ku", "locked": false, "subreddit": "cryptids", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "Dangerous_Word_3769", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1732936090.7572443, "created_utc": 1732417517.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/wou4obbqmr2e1.jpeg", "title": "Looking for the artist behind this", "permalink": "/r/cryptids/comments/1gyh9ku/looking_for_the_artist_behind_this/", "selftext": "Been looking for the artist behind this or at least where it originated, it's tossed on pretty much anything spooky but especially mothman", "media": null, "score": 175, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comment_count": 9, "over_18": false}, "74": {"id": "1h0fttk", "locked": false, "subreddit": "thetruthishere", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "unsettlingmemorial", "link_flair_text": "Picture/Evidence", "time": 1732936091.0542088, "created_utc": 1732638263.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1h0fttk/unsettling_memorial_found_while_urbexing_phone/", "title": "Unsettling memorial found while urbexing (phone number removed)", "permalink": "/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1h0fttk/unsettling_memorial_found_while_urbexing_phone/", "selftext": "Hey all, tonight a buddy and I went exploring a place we've previously been. But upon arrival, both my friend and I felt a looking sense that was not previously present. We felt instinctively more on edge and aware of our surroundings.\nUpon making it to the factory, we pulled out our radio to keep an eye on security and listened.

Unsettling? Yes. Frightening? Not quite.\nUpon feeling relatively secure, we then ventured into a building, once we entered we felt a sense of heaviness and dread.
