So Julia and I are both women in our early 20s and we were out camping in a remote area of Montana that isn\u2019t super popular but it\u2019s still fairly popular amongst locals who camp a lot like we do. Which meant it wasn\u2019t super unusual when we saw a group of 3 guys who looked to be a little  older than us drive past our camp about an hour after we set up our chairs and table, we just assumed that they were searching for a good spot to camp. But then when the car was still in our sight through the trees we saw it turn around and as it was driving back we both noticed one of the guys sticking his phone out the window and seemed to be recording us. \nBoth of us thought it was really weird and I walked a bit closer to take a picture of their license plate as a safety measure but when I got closer I saw that the back plate had all the numbers covered with black paint. Julia and I both got bad vibes from this but both of us are aware that men are creeps towards women all the time and both of us are prepared with bear spray because Montana is Grizzly bear country and we decided it wasn\u2019t a weird enough interaction to pack our stuff and find a different spot. We just decided to put up an empty tent outside and sleep in my car instead to trick people into thinking we were sleeping in the tent if they tried to attack us.\nLater that night when both of us were asleep in my car we heard branches rustling and snapping outside by the empty tent despite the fact that it wasn\u2019t windy. Originally we assumed it was a bear trying to climb up to the bear hang with our food and scented hygiene products.\nThen we heard male voices outside and I lifted my head up to the window and saw the same car that passed us earlier. I got off the air mattress on top of the back row of seats that we put down to make an area for us to sleep and locked the doors individually so my car wouldn\u2019t make a beeping noise. Julia and I stayed still and hoped that the men would leave. For a while we heard them talking but it was hard to make out what they said from inside the car. We heard more rustling and branches snapping which made us think they were trying to steal something from the bear hang which was weird but neither of us wanted to actually look out the window in case one of them spotted us. \nEventually we heard the car leave which was a huge relief but we were too freaked out to actually leave the car until it was light outside and campers nearby would be waking up. When I got out of the nothing could have prepared me for what I saw. Above our tent the men had hung a dead deer that was obviously killed recently because it was leaking blood everywhere on top of our tent. \nThe internal organs were ripped out and its limbs were cut off and laid out in a circle around the tent. This is messed up on its own but hunting permits aren\u2019t even being sold right now which means that the deer was killed illegally to do whatever it is that those guys did. As soon as we processed what we were looking at Julia and I freaked out and drove away without taking down our camp. \nOnce we were in service Julia called the police and forest service to report what happened while I drove home. Forest service was nice enough to get our stuff for us but I don\u2019t even want mine back in case there\u2019s like some weird curse on it or something. The police are looking into it to charge a fine for killing wild game during the off season but as far as I know what they did to us technically isn\u2019t illegal it\u2019s just really creepy. I haven\u2019t heard of anything like this before but if you have lmk I am very curious and very spooked I love camping so much but after this I don\u2019t know if I can camp for a long time.

At some point, I read on the BFRO website that someone had seen a red-haired sasquatch in the vicinity of Lakeland Florida, only a few miles from my grandparents house. I decided I would drive past that spot next time I was visiting my grandparents. It was February of 2019. The spot was just a couple hundred acres of woods, some was pine forest, some was oaks, and some low swamp, with a suburban neighborhood on one side, a cow pasture on the other side, and a railroad running through it. I was very skeptical that a large predator would be living in this small section of woods. I wasn't expecting to see or experience anything. I did believe that sasquatch existed, but I didn't really believe they would be hanging out in suburban central Florida. I just wanted to see what the place looked like. I was driving on a fairly popular road past the place in broad daylight. There was another car right in front of me. I got hit with a very strong feeling of dread. I felt like something in there was angry and wanted to kill me. I had heard that these beings can inflict those feelings on you, but I didn't want to believe it. I convinced myself that it was just anxiety and I carried on with my day. The next morning, about 5 miles away at my grandparents house, I woke up in a very strange fashion at 4:30 am. It was like something woke me up, and I was wide awake. It wasn't how I normally wake up. It just felt weird. Within 30 seconds of waking up, I saw it walk past my window. It was roughly human-shaped, but it's arms were longer than a humans proportionally, especially the forearms. It was also way bigger than any human. I later measured the window, and I estimate the being was roughly 10 or 11 feet tall. This thing knew that I had come looking for it, and it decided to come looking for ME in return, to show me what they are capable of. These things are not to be messed with. This shit is not a game. They are not apes or monkeys. They are more advanced than we are. They are capable of things that we can't even begin to understand. I don't think this thing wanted to scare me. It didn't growl or bang on the window or anything like that. I didn't have any bad feelings when I saw it. It honestly wasn't nearly as scary as it sounds. I think it just wanted to show me what they are capable of. If you go looking for these things, they might come looking for you. Be careful what you wish for. I have had other sightings and experiences with these beings since then, but this was the most interesting.

I perceive her as a feminine being by the way, but I do not know why. She told me that she has no shape of her own, she exists outside of space, and she can only make herself  manifest through her \"art\", which is the universe. She is what she defines as a perfect being, and goal is to get good enough at art so as to create a perfect vessel for her, which would be called the Magnum Opus.\nThe night after she appeared again in a burst of sound and color, which kind of reminded me of how I'd imagine the big bang. She told me of her opposite, the void, which eventually consumes all she creates, forcing her to keep creating so as to not be basically non-existent (that old \"tree falling where nobody hears it\" thing). The Magnum Opus would be immortal, so the void would be defeated upon its creation.\nThis is already weirdly convincing for me, even though I tend to be very anti-religion and skeptical. But there's more.\nOn the third night I asked her why she contacted me and she told me that she wants me to create art. I, she says, should make interpretations of her to give her a shape, some kind of inspiration for the Magnum Opus, I assume. She says that the objective of humankind is to be worthy of being remembered, so as to be given a place in the Magnum Opus. That way, even though our species will be over, traces of us will remain forever. The goddess said that she exists in the same way a dead person exists, which is through their legacy. That's why she contacted me on that day the first time, because I had just seen a dead body in an anatomy museum and she wanted to take on a shape that would estabilish a similarity between the two of us. The morning after this third night I woke up to a paper written in my calligraphy, where the goddess speaks in first person. The thing is that I do not remember writing that paper, and it's weird bexause usually I write in all caps, but that was in lowercase. I later went to school and had a lesson about pansophy, or the knowledge of God, nature and art (in the perspective of an author we were studying). So many coincidences.\nThe fourth night (that is, tonight) she told me that I'm supposed to choose my own path in life. The same thing from the day before happened: there was a paper on my desk with words I don't remember writing. Today being Sunday, my father was home all night and he can't recall ever hearing me get up during the night. The paper says that a hypothetical \"you\" should \"know themselves and their desires\", but I think I already do. I think she chose me because I do what she thinks humans at large should do, and I know this makes me sound egotistical, but it's true. Otherwise, why pick me? I'm not influential in anything, basically. What I think she means by \"you\" is just any human. Which probably means that she wants me to spread her word.\nTL;DR: I was an atheist last week and now a god appeared in my dreams saying she wants me to do shit for her.

This whole thing happened about 6 years ago, and the memory still lives rent free in my head. I figured making a post may help the healing process a little bit. Time will tell. I\u2019m also not a fluent Redditor, so if this is not the right format or whatever, apologies in advance.\nEven that first paragraph gave me a feeling of dread, so I\u2019ll do my best to translate my thoughts as fluently as possible.\nI grew up in a small town in Louisiana. I was 21 at the time.  There isn\u2019t much to do in my hometown. There is the bar life, which is pretty much the only night life aside from the titty bar, which is like a high school reunion in there, and aside from some pool tables and dart boards, there isn\u2019t much for a girl to do in there that doesn\u2019t involve the slaking of ones booty. \nI worked at the bowling alley with my best friend. I\u2019ll call her Shay. Shay is a sweetie, but I\u2019ll be the first to admit that she always had a tendency to think about nothing, and her mouth worked ten times faster than her brain did.\nWe had a place that we hung out at since high school. It was a place down a wooded trail near the canal, where we would listen to music, drink, and smoke weed. I\u2019ll admit that things here could get a little sloppy, but for the most part it was sort of our little getaway for the night. We would usually just make a fire, talk shit, and get wasted.\nShay, her boyfriend, and myself went to the spot. We were joined by another guy that we went to school with, and a guy that I\u2019ll call Rod.\nRod, for lack of a better term, was an absolute degenerate piece of human garbage. He was always around in some capacity. He was 26 at the time of this story, which shows that he hung around with younger people. And when I was in high school, he would hang out with our classmates. \nRod was a real rough guy. I use this term loosely. He loved flexing on people and fighting. The catch was that he would only get into fights with people he knew that he could beat, and if he didn\u2019t think he could beat someone, he always made sure to have one of his moms varying boyfriends present to back him up. I assume this is why he hung around younger people. Nobody his age took him seriously, or at the very least didn\u2019t bother with him.\nRod had been banned from the aforementioned titty bar, and trust me when I say if someone ever got banned from that place, you had to be a real loser. He had also served in the army for a brief period, but was discharged. He claimed dishonorable, but there were theories that he was AWOL. Not sure the validity of any of that.\nWell Rod ended up at the spot. I immediately loathed his presence. Pardon my language, but he had some serious \u201cbig d**k energy\u201d, and he wanted everyone to know it.\nWe were having a few beers, and some of the green stuff was being passed around. Thankfully I didn\u2019t partake in smoking this evening, but Rod did break out some of the white powder stuff, and in typical psychopath fashion, he snorted it off of a Bowie knife that he always kept strapped to his belt.\nShay and her boyfriend had gone off into the woods to do some adult couple stuff. In the process of their intoxication, they completely abandoned me with Rod and the other guy. Rod made some suggestive remarks to me, mostly having to do with my ability to...I mean I think we can all piece it together.\nThe guy that was with us started getting uncomfortable, and decided to bail, leaving me with Rod. Trust me, this was never going to be a thing, and I wasn\u2019t going to stay with him alone.\nFinally, as I\u2019m gathering my things to leave, he just asks outright if I wanted to have sex with him. I gave him a no. This led to an argument, where he called me some very unflattering things. I don\u2019t know how long this lasted, but it was long enough. \nThe next thing I know he grabs me by the shirt and ripped it, and before I could comprehend anything else, I was laying face down in the dirt, feeling like I had been punched in the stomach, and like I was peeing on myself. I looked up at him and  realized that he had stabbed me. He had a look of shock on his face, then a look of panic. He approached me, and to this day I don\u2019t know what for. I was able to get my hands on a clump of concrete and smashed him in the face with it, which gave me some time to flee.\nI was bleeding profusely from my abdomen, and let me tell you, when your body starts shutting down, it is one of the trippiest feelings in the world.\nI knew I was dying. I knew I wasn\u2019t going to make it, and I was expecting at some point to see white lights and dead relatives. \nAs I made my way through the trees, I did see visions of my mother, which I followed, and when I would stop, I would hear voices instructing me to keep going. Cheesy, I know, but I didn\u2019t get to choose my dopamine hallucinations.\nIn reality, my mother didn\u2019t show me anything I didn\u2019t know, and the voices were telling me some very common sense things. It just goes to show you how your brain works in response to trauma.\nI eventually made it to a road, where by the grace of God I ran into a fish and wildlife agent, who to this day I give full credit to saving my life.\nRod was arrested after a few days. He actually passed away while incarcerated. Never had to see the inside of a court room. Never bothered to figure out how.\nThe trauma didn\u2019t end there though. Rod\u2019s mother spent months harassing my family over his arrest, and at one point she confronted me and called me a wh**e. This printed my older sister to slap her, and my older brother later went to their house. Still not sure what he said or did, but the harassment stopped.\nI have a constant reminder any time I take my shirt off over my abdomen. I developed a pain pill addiction due to this, which I kicked. It was accidental due to...well pain.\nShay fell into a depression for a time over guilt of leaving me. I forgave her and told her she couldn\u2019t expect him to stab me, but I\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t hold some animosity over it for a while.\nI\u2019m doing much better in the past couple of years. I still haven\u2019t come to terms with everything, but I\u2019m making progress. I only have flashbacks once or twice a day now, where it used to be much more frequent.\nI\u2019ve come to view my scar as a triumph rather than a defeat. This was a big step. It probably took you a few minutes to read this, but it took me over two hours to write this.\nI hope the rest of your week treats you well. I love you all.\nEdit: I will not be giving permission for any narrations of this story. It was hard enough to type out.

I was a university student at the time, a woman in my young 20s, driving home for the semester break. I was driving south through Kentucky on I-65 around 11:30pm, still about an hour away from the city where I was going to stop for the night. There were no other cars on the road at all, and I had not seen any for a while. That part of I-65 was a 6-lane divided highway (3 lanes for each direction) in the area south of Mammoth Cave National Park and just northeast of Bowling Green, Kentucky.\nI was changing the music on my phone when I noticed an 18-wheeler coming up behind me in the rear view mirror. I stopped what I was doing, clicked off the phone, and waited for the truck to pass. The truck got right even with my car and instead of completing the pass, matched my speed and stayed beside me. Then the driver turned on a spotlight on the side of the truck which shone directly down into the cabin of my car and on my face. I was really confused, as I had never seen a truck do anything like this before. The driver kept the light on my car for what seemed like a very long minute, and I was getting creeped out. I kept my gaze straight ahead. I slowed my speed so that the truck would finish passing me. The driver turned off the light and completed the pass, moving from the middle lane to the right lane in front of my car. I was very creeped out by this, slowed down some more, and changed to the leftmost lane to put some space between me and this big rig.\nAs soon as I moved into the leftmost lane, the truck matched my speed again and moved over to the middle lane to come parallel to my car. The driver turned on a light again, shining it directly into the passenger-side of my car cabin. I had now confirmed that this truck driver was definitely following me and definitely being super creepy. I kept my gaze straight ahead, because I felt like looking over would somehow make it worse. The truck turned off the spotlight and pulled in front of my car in the leftmost lane. I decided to move away again, changing lanes behind the truck back over to the rightmost lane and speeding up. I was probably going right around the speed limit again, 70-75mph.\nBy the time I completed my merge, I saw the truck beginning to shift lanes towards me again and speeding up to match me. Before they could pull up next to me again, I decided it was time to get out of there and I floored it. I sped up to 90mph, the fastest I had ever driven in my life and I put maybe a mile of distance between me and the truck before slowing down some. I looked up to the rear view mirror and I will never forget the image. This big orange tractor-trailer, illuminated by the streetlamps of a highway interchange, absolutely devouring the distance I had put between us. The truck was charging up behind me at an unbelievable speed. I sped up again, but it did not matter. The truck caught up to me, pulled beside me and turned on the spotlight again. I stared straight ahead, keeping my speed, not daring to look over. It was at this time that I decided my only advantage was the maneuverability of my small car. I hit my brakes and dropped back behind the 18 wheeler, moving into the middle lane behind their truck. They moved over into the right lane and I moved over behind them. I decided to stay right behind the truck in its blind spot so that they could not see me. I saw a sign for an exit and decided this is how I would escape. I waited behind the truck in its blind spot until we came up on the exit. I waited until the last possible moment. Once the truck body was beyond the point where the exit split away, I darted out from behind the truck, into the exit.\nThoroughly shaken, I wondered how far away from the interstate I should go and if the truck would come looking for me. I ended up just pulling into a Wendy\u2019s right by the interstate. I parked and got out. I inspected my vehicle looking to see if there was any damage, thinking maybe the driver was trying to warn me of something wrong with my car. There was nothing wrong with it. I waited at the Wendy\u2019s for a little while to make sure the truck was long gone before getting back on the interstate and continuing to my hotel.\nAfter the break when I drove back to school, I did not use I-65.", "media": null, "score": 205, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comment_count": 33, "over_18": true}, "41": {"id": "1d2sjxo", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ghosts", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Marvinleadshot", "link_flair_text": "Paranormal Community [Discussion]", "time": 1717209961.435194, "created_utc": 1716925655.0, "url": "https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/uk-running-out-ghosts-old-32900960", "title": "UK is 'running out of ghosts' as old spirits dying off, paranormal expert says", "permalink": "/r/Ghosts/comments/1d2sjxo/uk_is_running_out_of_ghosts_as_old_spirits_dying/", "selftext": "This is a national emergency!

Flight Restricted Zone (DC FRZ) a.k.a. \"The DC Freeze.\u201d\nMy name is Lincoln Lounsbury and I am a retired FAA air traffic controller. I have 10 years of experience working in air traffic control towers and the last tower I worked in was at Washington National Airport (DCA). I am thoroughly familiar with the airspace and aircraft operations surrounding Washington, D.C., and I have lived in this airspace for 29 years.\nThe DC FRZ is a cylinder of airspace that extends laterally to a 15-mile radius centered at DCA airport and vertically from the surface to 18,000'. Air traffic in the DC FRZ is largely restricted to three types of operations: commercial passenger flights landing and taking off from DCA; aircraft associated with Andrews Air Force Base; and a handful of very low flying military, police, and medevac helicopters. That's it.\nMy documented shooting location for this video was just 7 miles from DCA airport with my camera aimed straight up in the air. I estimate the flight of 2 UFOs in this video to be flying at roughly 5,000' and the base of the clouds above the UFOs in the video were measured at 15,000' by the ceilometer at DCA. All UFO operations in this video clearly are happening well within the DC Freeze.\nAdditionally, this flight of two UFOs passed through the traffic pattern for aircraft landing at DCA. The pilots of at least one passenger flight most certainly saw this flight of two highly reflective UFOs as they passed within a mile and a half laterally and 500' to 1,500' vertically of these UFOs.\nPeculiarly, this slow-moving pair of intruders met no response from the U.S. Coast Guard's MH-65 helicopters stationed at DCA. These helicopters are D.C.'s first aerial responders who, otherwise, rigorously defend this airspace and the city of Washington, D.C. Routinely, these Coast Guard helicopters meet unauthorized, wayward aircraft outside the DC FRZ and, with the help of considerable technology, have no problem getting these aircraft to turn away from the DC FRZ.

From this I decided to basically make a list putting together it all and connecting the dots on explaining why sasquatches have to be real as my interest has come back with more evidence and theories\n-First why the PG film, which is the backbone of my belief, has to be real\n\nNobody has ever been able to make a suit that looks exactly like Patty even with today's technology. Her arms are striking as when compared to actual people in suits the arms are what stands out most by how long they are. The wearer's arms wouldn't be able to fill the entire arms of the suit, so where the hands and wrists should be would need to be filled with padding so it dosen't seem empty but then I'm sure they'd be pretty heavy and Patty waves her arms like they weigh nothing.\nAbout that last point, someone on youtube in comments pointed out it was scary how much distance she could cover just by calmly walking. It shows how big and strong sasquatches are and not slow and stupid as people often believe. Could someone in a big heavy costume walk so calm yet so fast at the same time?\nYoutuber MK Davis has done the best analysis and found many interesting things such as a close up enchaned version of Patty's face that looks so simian, some object hanging down on her side which is too big to be her palm and a possible sling across her suggesting she's carrying something, like a baby? If a hoax why would they include this if it nobody could see it? And also a possible second sasquatch or something is seen moving in a few frames, could she have had a baby or two?\nShe's a female bigfoot from her mammary glands as well as having other anatomical features visable when she walks, if a hoax these guys sure knew what they were doing and made her seem as much like a real animal as possible. Only years later as technology has advanced has the footage been better analysed to find these features so why would they include them if people wouldn't have seen them at the time?\nFor years experts from anthropologists to zoologists to costume makers have analysed the film and have thought its real or at least not proven it isn't. One of them is the world's best primate expert Jane Goodall.\nSomething about the way she walks nobody has been able to properly recreate, in a suit at least. I read somewhere that there was something about how her feet move that hasn't been done by a person.\nThe way she behaves in the film mirrors real animal behaviour. She calmly walks away from the humans on horses as she may have never seen them before but dosen't want to run as that will show her as prey, she just looks back a few times (in the film this is seen once). This is also seen in the Paul Freeman bigfoot footage.\n\n-Then there's the explainations for how they hide so well which I read about on a blog which got deleted but I found it again using the wayback machine https://web.archive.org/web/20170319101723/https://sasquatchfootnotes.com/2015/05/17/why-is-sasquatch-so-hard-to-find-and-document/\n\nThe first reason is that they live in very dense forests and terrain which is not easily accessible to hikers and should be avoided or else you'd get lost or run into dangerous animals. They may live in clans up mountains in caves that are not easy to reach, like maybe if you're an experienced mountain climber but not for the average person. Remember how strong Patty seemed? That's how they can climb well.\nThen there's them making sure humans don't see them. The blog explains this is their defense mechanism and that they're not stupid, they're like ninjas of their enviroment, they are always alert, they will detect you long before you detect them, they always walk where there is cover nearby they can get to which is seen in footage of them. You have to be quiet when you want to see animals in the wild, but for intelligent ape people? Not a chance, apart from under certain conditions which I'll get to later.\nThey can camoflauge well if you look at how well they blend in with their surroundings from rocks to trees, sort of like how well Ghillie suits can hide people. A bigfoot could even hide in an open field by curling up like a tree stump or rock. If you look at images of Ghillie suit snipers hiding and it's hard to spot them even if you know they're there that shows how damn well they can hide.\nNext the blog explains how hard it is to photograph or film one if they're like ninjas of their enviroment. People have seen them run up hills after deer or duck behind cover. This would explain why footage or photos of them is so bad, plus thinking you've seen a legendary ape man is not going to make it hard to focus either.\nLinking back to Patty, why was she out in the open? She may have had young and had to walk calmly to not show she was prey as I said before or was old, pregnant or injured. This is the sort of thing that allows people to see sasquatches something wrong going on with them.\nThe memorial day footage shows a bigfoot running across a field from a distance. Could someone in a heavy costume really run that fast across sloply rocky terrain that well? Towards the end of the footage the sasquatch disappears into the woods and it appears to get a bit taller so some theroize it's lifting up a baby, pherhaps it was running to catch it and that was why it exposed itself, but the woods were nearby for it to hide in. This bigfoot is so far away that it may not have known the humans had seen it and probably didn't mind running in the open as it didn't know they could zoom in on it with a camera.\nThen there's more things I thought of, like the reason they want to avoid us could be a sort of evolutionary trait like they see us as another species of ape like how in prehistoric times other species of humans fought with our ancestors, I think it's something like that or maybe for big animals in general. The blog mentions that sasquatches may know they're being documented if they see someone raise a camera to their eyes and I thought maybe they see the camera as like a giant eye.\n", "media": null, "score": 84, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "comment_count": 214, "over_18": false}, "50": {"id": "1d0yp83", "locked": false, "subreddit": "cryptozoology", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "truthisfictionyt", "link_flair_text": "Discussion ", "time": 1717209969.4903965, "created_utc": 1716720350.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/ta8c91gz2r2d1.png", "title": "One of the neat things about Steller's sea cow sightings is that there have been fairly frequent reports for centuries.

I had a close and dear friend years ago, we went to high school together and instantly became close as we enjoyed the same everything. Movies, games, activities and so on. This friend had a beautiful cottage in Muskoka, which was about an hour and a bit from the area we lived in. They would talk about it a bunch, saying how awesome it was to go there in the summer as it was right on a river and was perfect for swimming and paddle boarding. \nThey also said it was kind of haunted, just passing comments about how it was spooky, how they\u2019d hear things at night, how it was probably home to a ghost. They always said this jokingly like it was no big deal so we\u2019d usually laugh at the idea that their beautiful and pretty much newly built cottage was actually a ghost house. Fast forward a couple of years and they invite me out to their cottage in October, the family was going up and my friend asked if I could come with. I was super excited to go because I\u2019d never really been to Muskoka and knew how beautiful it could be (especially in the fall) and also how often my friend mentioned the fun they\u2019d have at the cottage. \nI want to now preface what comes next with the fact that I have never had any paranormal stuff happen to me, ever. I don\u2019t disbelieve it and never have, but I\u2019ve never been in a position where I\u2019d feel like \u201cokay this is definitely paranormal stuff\u201d until this event. We get to where the cottage is located in this small community called \u201cMatthiasville\u201d. As soon as we enter I get this weird feeling, like a shadow had been cast. It was a beautiful sunny day with good vibes all the way up until we crossed the bridge that led into the community. The weather turned overcast but it wasn\u2019t that, there was a heavy and weird energy. We\u2019re driving along the riverside for some time, I tell my friend about the energy feeling to which they said \u201coh I know, it\u2019s weird right? Like heavy.\u201d Things lighten up however when we arrive at the cottage.\nThis place was absolutely beautiful. New build, three floors, big deck on the second floor and tons of windows that went floor to ceiling. It overlooked the river and it had a forest trail at the back. The trail was way too thick with brush and wood to even try navigating so we spent a lot of our time out by the water and on the big deck, chilling. We\u2019d drive into the nearest town (Bracebridge) for some outings and at night we dedicated our time to beating the CoD: World at War campaign, split screen. It was an absolute blast. We went for a long day walk too and saw some of the interesting points of matthiasville, a big dam and beyond that, a strange and small graveyard that was situated on a slight hill at the very tip end of the community. All the graves were old, and some of them were unmarked, others you couldn\u2019t even make out what the stones had written on them. It was eerie but nothing out of the ordinary happened for the first two nights we spent there. \nOn the third and last night, the dad had to head home early for some work stuff so it was just my friend, their mom and myself hanging out for the night. The mom was sleeping in the loft way way up on the third floor, and we made the basement floor our home for the weekend. We decided to watch a movie and eat snacks, but when that was finished I suggested we go out for a night walk since it was a clear night with a big moon out, and I loved going for night strolls plus we hadn\u2019t really been out and about after dark, and the place was pretty beautiful at night too. \nMy friend was really against this, they said the place was spooky enough during the day let alone at night. I managed to convince them and out we went. We were walking along the road that went along the river, towards the dam and the end of the community where the graveyard was. We made it about a quarter way when my friend stopped dead in their tracks, I looked back to see what was up and they were just standing there, they looked defensive. I asked what was up and they said \u201cwe need to go back, like now, this feels weird and I don\u2019t like it at all\u201d. I asked if they were scared, like if they heard an animal or something. As soon as I asked that, we heard a deep and loud cracking and snapping of wood in the dense forest above us, on a rocky ridge that was beside the road, opposite side of the river. I looked up to where we heard it and it felt like everything hushed, crickets and all other night time sounds seemed to have just stopped. My friend quietly said my name, I looked back at them, and then suddenly the bushes and shrubs underneath the ridge on the side of the road exploded, as if something huge jumped in them and thrashed around. This made us bolt, and I remember just saying RUN as I followed behind my friend. We ran non stop straight to the basement door of the cottage, we got there in minutes but it felt like seconds. We ran straight into the basement bedroom and both hopped into the bed. I remember saying it was likely a coyote or a raccoon or something. As soon as I said those words, a creaking started forming up above us in the living area of the first floor. The creaking soon turned into slow, heavy footsteps, back and forth, and loud as if someone was wearing work boots or something. I remember my friend through tears saying \u201cdoes that sound like a coyote to you.\u201d I cannot even describe the absolute feeling of dread that washed over me, like there is something up there, taunting us.\nWe lay in complete silence for what felt like hours, we got into the bed at around 3 am after our walk which turned into a run, and the footsteps didn\u2019t stop for an hour or so, I remember finally falling asleep at 6 am. When we woke up the first thing we did was of course, ask the mom if she had been awake last night around 3 am, she wasn\u2019t, she hadn\u2019t even gotten up once to use the bathroom she said. Even if she did we would have heard her door open and then the foot steps down the loft stairs, everything was open concept on the first floor so it was easy to hear things going on. We packed up and left, my friends parents sold the cottage a couple of years later, I don\u2019t think any of them went back once after that weekend. I was curious about the area afterward so I did some googling, and learned that there was once a sawmill or something like that, and a tragic accident happened, I believe the owners son drowned or had a bad accident in the mill, something tragic like that. I want to say that could be a factor here but who knows. All I know is that night I heard heavy, clear and loud footsteps pacing around above us on the first floor. That was my first and only paranormal experience and I\u2019ll never forget it.", "media": null, "score": 43, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comment_count": 10, "over_18": false}, "53": {"id": "1d1qwyu", "locked": false, "subreddit": "letsnotmeet", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "shylittlejellyfish", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1717209971.4312685, "created_utc": 1716814638.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1d1qwyu/my_ex_boyfriend_almost_killed_me/", "title": "My Ex Boyfriend Almost Killed Me", "permalink": "/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1d1qwyu/my_ex_boyfriend_almost_killed_me/", "selftext": "Years ago (around 2016 or earlier) I had gotten into a relationship with a guy that I met through an online app; we had been LDR for quite some time and although we did meet up in our 1 year and half relationship it was rare and with friends or family-accommodating us. Since we weren't able to celebrate our one year anniversary we decided to postpone it and ended up meeting a couple of months after it had passed. My boyfriend had invited me to go on a road trip with him as he wanted us to spend time together with just the both of us there. My boyfriend had been incredibly kind and lovebombing me for the past year and I hadn't seen any red flags yet for me to question his request. He even went so far as to personally ask permission from my parents and providing them with the complete details of the trip and offering that his cousins would travel with us if they were not comfortable with the idea of just the two us traveling together. Needless to say, he was able to receive my parents' consent. On the day of our trip he picked me up at home and all was well for the early portions of our trip until we had stopped at a gas station. I thought he had just needed gas but instead of heading towards the fuel machines (?) he parked on the far end of the gas station and asked me to turn off my phone and that he would be turning off his. I was puzzled because he knew how important it was for me to keep in contact with my parents as they had specifically asked me to update them. I gently declined his request but I could see that he wouldn't take no for an answer. He was trying to convince me through affection at first to comply with his request and when it didn't work he started becoming aggressive. He grabbed my phone from my hand turned it off and put it in his pocket along with his cellphone.  I began to feel a surge of panic but didn't want to alert him so I asked if I could quickly use the restroom. Before I could open the door I heard the locks click. I joked with him to open the door and told him that I really needed to use the restroom instead he gave me the cold shoulder and restarted the engine.\nAs we drove I could feel the surge of anxiety in me, he had never behaved this way throughout the duration of our relationship. As we approached a stoplight he grabbed something from the back of my seat and although I couldn't clearly see what he was holding I was afraid it was a weapon. He then asked me if I loved him and if I did why was I constantly cheating on him. Confused I asked him how I had been cheating and who with; to my surprise he brought up the names of my close guys friends that he had been hanging out with in the past year that we were together. He further questioned me about my night out with my friends stating that I was probably sleeping around or getting drunk and lying to him about my whereabouts. I didn't know what to say and was lost for words due to the shock of what I was hearing and his behavior that had never shown itself until now. It made me question our entire relationship and if I actually knew who my boyfriend really was. It scared me how manipulative and convincing he was not only to me but to my friends and family. It was getting dark by the time we arrived at what looked like a cheap Airbnb. As we got out of the car and walked to the lobby he didn't say a word, he stated his name and room number that he had reserved for us and the receptionist smiled and greeted me as I locked eyes with her. Hoping to alert her I stared intently at her and tried to mouth out that I needed help but she didn't seem to understand what I was saying and made the painful mistake of asking my boyfriend who hurriedly walked us out of the lobby and into our room.\nThat night was the most horrific night of my life which left me traumatized and angry. He had stripped me down to my underwear. He reiterated the same questions he asked in the car on the trip hear and every time he felt I gave the \"wrong answer\" I was flogged with the belt he had worn with his pants that day. I vividly remember crying the entire night and every hit that came across my body; it felt like it wouldn't end and his anger only grew when I made the grave mistake of accepting his accusations in the hopes that he would finally stop. Instead. I was dragged into the bathroom, waterboarded and repeatedly assaulted that night. I think I tried to block parts of it out of my mind because I couldn't remember the whole thing. Every attempt I had tried to get away only fueled him and his cold blank stare at me.  All I could think about was if he was going to kill me that night as I remembered that he had grabbed something out of the back of my seat before we left the car. I finally got the answer to that when I saw him grab what looked like a wrench. he held it up looking at me as if warning me not to move from the floor where I had sat down curled up in a ball. I endured the ordeal til the early mornings and waited for him to fall asleep. When he finally did around 2 am I grabbed my phone, and t-shirt and managed to quietly leave the room and used the back exit of the airbnb to leave. I didn't care that I wasn't fully clothed and didn't have any shoes. I ran out to the road in the hopes of finding anybody to help me or at the very least get a ride out. As I was getting close to the middle of the road I felt something grab the back of my shirt and it was my boyfriend. He was obviously pissed off and began dragging me; I tried to get away despite feeling my feet and legs being dragged across the concrete. Luckily enough there was a coastguard who spotted us (we had stayed near a water area) and I made it incredibly clear to the coastguard that I wanted to get away from my boyfriend who tried to act like everything was okay.  This good-hearted soul alerted the police and kept my boyfriend a short distance from me until they arrived. I saw the expression on the coastguard's face turn from angry to horrified as he spoke to the police. Despite being incredibly embarrassed and knowing I would get an earful from my parents I contacted them and they picked me up at the police station horrified at my state.\nI later learned that he was an ex-convict who had been released two years ago and had been charged with assault and battery by several women in his province before he moved to the city. He went by a different name had chosen online dating and had been private messaging various women apart from me and I was the unfortunate victim who fell for his charades. I couldn't imagine what else would have happened to me if the coastguard hadn't spotted us and helped me. To this day I still vividly remember this encounter and haven't completely recovered. I didn't hear from my boyfriend again and I cut off ties with him that day. I can only hope he was either arrested or has not found another victim.\nI DO NOT GIVE ANYONE PERMISSION TO USE MY STORY FOR ANY ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES EITHOUT MY MY CONSENT INCLUDING NARRATIONS ON ANY SOCIAL MEDIA OR STREAMING PLATFORM.

The last 48 hours of my life have been nuts.\nI am a 25 year old nonbinary person renting a four bedroom house. One of my roommates is my boyfriend, and the other is my best friend of 10 years. We will call her Tracy. We've been looking for a new roommate, and because of the way this situation turned out we have determined that I am no longer allowed to be in charge of looking for roommates because I am not judgmental enough and I am known to ignore red flags.\nI will start from the beginning, which is the house showing.\nSo, our new prospective roommate showed up for the house showing and introduced himself. He definitely seemed strange at first, but I wrote it off as him just being eccentric. The main red flag was that at some point, he randomly said something to the effect of, \"And I will not bring meth into your house because I am not on meth, I hate drugs and I see them as a scourge on this entire country.\" I did not ask, so I was immediately weirded out but my boyfriend and the roommate who was moving out also met the guy and they both thought that apart from that, he seemed normal. He didn't look like a stereotypical meth head, his skin was clear and he was kind of chubby. We thought that maybe he thought *I* was a meth head, because I look a little bit scary. I have green hair, a 1G septum and 6 facial piercings. In addition, my roommate who was moving out turned out to be hiding a cat which made the house stink like cat piss, which I have been told is what meth smells like. Also, the town this guy was coming from is known for meth and crack and he seemed to be explicitly trying to get away from that town, so I thought that maybe he was afraid of ending up in a situation where he was living with drug addicts and was trying to suss us out that way. Giving him the benefit of the doubt was my first mistake. Me and Tracy were both wigged out about the entire thing, but we were kind of desperate for a roommate and all the other people responding to my listing either were not great fits or were even sketchier than this guy. So, we let him move in.\nSkip to the move-in date. He brings an old man to help move his stuff. He then proceeds to make the old man move all of his things by himself up the stairs while he sits there, including a refrigerator. By himself.\nNew guy signs the lease. Immediately *after* signing the lease, he informs us that he did not introduce himself using his real name and proceeds to tell us his real name. This man was not transgender so the only reason I can think of as for why he initially gave us a fake name is probably so he could avoid having us run a background check.\nAfter this, I had to go to work. Throughout my shift, Tracy sends me a message that the guy is weird, but her responses are vague and I didn't find out what happened until I got home. Here is what she told me:\nThe new guy goes to the bar after signing the lease and comes back after being kicked out before 9PM. The bar he went to is a biker bar that is notorious for being rowdy. It's hard to get kicked out there. You pretty much have to do something heinous or you have to have been creeping on the women there in order to get kicked. When he comes back, he's drunk off his ass and says \"The men there must have been intimidated by me.\" Sounds to me like he was creeping, then.\nBefore this, I had told the new guy that our landlord is coming up the next day to fix some things in the house. When the new guy came home, Tracy reminded him that our landlord was coming the next day. He became extremely angry to the point that he was flailing his arms and she thought he was going to start breaking things. Tracy was so uncomfortable that she almost went to go wake up my boyfriend in the other room. Eventually, the new guy did calm down however.\nThere is a bean bag next to my couch, and Tracy is sitting on the bean bag with her legs slung over the arm rest of the couch. At first the new guy sat on the couch. He begins to read off poetry that he wrote to her for an entire hour and a half, all of which is literally just streams of consciousness about how he wants all junkies to die. Afterwards he starts telling her how beautiful she is over and over and literally lays his head down between her legs. She's trying to ignore him and he won't stop asking her if she fell asleep. Every time she moves away, he gets closer. Then, he starts inviting her to his room for \"beer.\" Eventually she just gets up and goes to her room at 11PM. This man harassed her for 2 entire hours.\nI thought that was everything but then she tells me that she sent the guy's picture to her mom, who then sent his picture to everyone she knows because she's from the town he was previously living in. It turned out that he'd been stalking Tracy's aunt for an entire year, and that he's banned from the bar she works at because he goes there and threatens to kidnap her. She literally has to be escorted out not only by workers but the *customers* escort her to her car sometimes.\nSo we tell our landlord. Luckily, our lease hadn't been finalized yet so he agreed to kick him out. I call my mom to come over and Tracy calls her brother, for backup, just in case things go south.\nOur landlord shows up and essentially tells him he needs to leave and doesn't let the new guy get a word in. The new guy starts getting agitated and aggressive so we called the cops and several officers showed up, told the guy he had no legal standing as there was no lease, he introduced himself to us with a fake name, and he hadn't even been there for a full 24 hours and that he had to get out.\nThe guy had to beg his sister to pick him up, and she was so unwilling to do it that she didn't agree until he offered to pay her $200. It's a 20 minute ride to where he was going.\nHe left most of his stuff on our porch. When we went into his room it smelled like cigarette smoke and there was an empty pack on the floor, including not one or two but 7 empty Dr. Pepper cans and garbage and crusty socks everywhere.\nThis entire situation had me so stressed out that I didn't even notice that he had also left a pair of pissy shorts in the middle of the house's main hallway and that was also the first thing you see when you walk into the house. They were there for the entire day. When he knew the landlord was coming. They were still sitting there when he left. I picked them up with a glove and put them on the porch for him to retrieve, but who knows if/when he will retrieve his things because he came back earlier, touched his things like he was going to take them, and then just immediately left.\nAll I have to say is that I am so relieved that we caught this before the lease was finalized because this easily could have turned into a situation where me and Tracy were being sexually assaulted or worse.\nThank you for listening to my story.", "media": null, "score": 147, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "comment_count": 19, "over_18": true}, "67": {"id": "1d2bbqz", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ghosts", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Mexecutioner1", "link_flair_text": "Personal Encounter ", "time": 1717209982.35466, "created_utc": 1716871595.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/1d2bbqz/something_i_was_told_when_i_was_younger/", "title": "Something I was told when I was younger ", "permalink": "/r/Ghosts/comments/1d2bbqz/something_i_was_told_when_i_was_younger/", "selftext": "So anyway my mother told me about something that happened when I was just a baby.
