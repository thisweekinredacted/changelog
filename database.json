Jim & Coral Lorenzen's book \"UFO'S OVER THE AMERICAS\" chapter \"the flesh crawlers\" goes on to describe the event as relayed by investigator Richard Greenwell to the APRO (now defunct), and was put into contact with the abductee via a Peruvian group going by \"Institute Peruano de Relaciones Interplanetarias\". \nIn this encounter the abductee is referred to as C.A.V, an acronym to protect their identify as Mr. C.A.V or \"v\" as described in the report via the recorded tapes of this interaction between Mr. Greenwell and V. The following will be a summation of these events in best order I could manage as C.A.V during this interaction with Mr. Greenwell has himself a difficult time recalling which events happened in which order. \nIn 1949 V/C.A.V was driving on the Pan American Highway to a location called Lomo de Ballena en route from Pucusana to Lima. C.A.V spotted a shining metallic Disc hovering off to the side of the highway and was approx. 500 meters from where C.A.V had parked. He made his way over to the disc which appeared to be hovering six feet off of the ground taking around ten minutes to arrive. \nC.A.V was twenty meters away from the object when three entities exited the craft, the beings did not appear as far as C.A.V could recall, to exit from a visible door but simply arrived in front of him. Quoting C.A.V directly he described the entities as \"-they didn't have a defined form. They looked like three mummies. They had the profile of human beings but their legs were joined. They did not have two legs but one \"double\" one--like twins.\"\nAgain he reiterated \"-they had the form of, well, the description was as if they were sort of mummies. They had no exterior sign of sex, ears, or eyes. A body, a head, and legs joined together.\"\nHe would then go on to state to Mr.Greenwell that these entities has \"one large foot\", and they moved as such \"Yes, yes. They went along the ground but they moved, they sort of slid along the ground.\" Going on to state they moved \"normally\" and made no sound when doing so. \nWhen describing the hands and arms he would go on to say \"Yes, they had arms but their hands consisted of a group of four fingers stuck together and a separate thumb.\"\nThe question of their overall appearance was as such \"No. They had a sort of strange skin, a sort of towely, sandy-colored skin.\"\nWhen asked by Mr.Greenwell if C.A.V meant \"clothing\" or a suit of some sort C.A.V replied \"No, no! They didn't have any clothing. Their only covering was a strange towely skin.\" As well as adding to their facial features or lack-there of\n\"The head had no features at all, except at about the height of the eyes there was an oblong substance like jelly with a sort of bubble in the center. It was the only exterior feature. No ears, no mouth, no nose, nothing. The nose, or where it should be, had a form of a nose, sort of like when you pass a tight stocking over your face. No Nostrils.\"\nIt was at this point these entities began to speak (In the interview C.A.V could not determine which entities were speaking, and whether or not this conversation was occurring via normal speech or via some sort of telepathy) \nAdding to this already strange encounter, the entities did not speak to him in Spanish but in an English accent he described as \"someone who learned the language without adopting an accent.\" The entities would then ask C.A.V where they were located, and if they were located in north america, to which C.A.V informed them that it was in fact south america. At this point the entities swapped from using english into Spanish. Again C.A.V would refer to this spanish as \"learned spanish\" without a specific accent. \nWhen asked if these entities were surprised to find themselves in the wrong continent C.A.V stated they did not, and to speak with the \"chief\" of the land which C.A.V would state there were many \"chiefs\", he attempted to correct the entities asking if they meant \"president\" however according to him they were adamant in using the term \"chief\" specifically. \nIn C.A.V's words he would then say, \"Well, I said I could arrange maybe for someone to come and speak to them. I said I was frightened that they would do us harm, but they answered that they wanted to do no harm and just wanted to speak to my chief, as they had very important things to tell him. then came a series of questions and answers on both sides-\"\nEmphasizing he could not recall which order these questions were answered C.A.V would state the following questions and responses between him and these entities. \n\"One of the things they told me is that we were playing around with a new substance that could endanger the peace of the world--of the universe\"\n\"I asked them where they came from, and they said a strange name. We would call it a star they said, but they came from a place with a strange name I could not understand; probably their planet somewhere.\"\n\"From the conversation we had, I was able to deduce that they were frightened that, by playing around with atomic explosions, we would create some sort of chain reaction which would not only destroy the world but endanger the universe\"\n\"In another question, I [C.A.V] asked them who their God was and I noticed a sort of mockery. \"God?.\" they said. \"What God?\" \"Well, the Supreme Creator,\" I said, \"who made the universe.\" \"Well, we are like gods,\" they said. \"How can you be gods?\" I asked. And they said that we were very backward. They said that we fought over a flag, over a frontier, that we had wars of trifling matters, like children. We were like children literally still in our diapers. We fought over food, we fought over sea. I then asked them if they did not have those same defects. but they said that they had overcome those years, centuries ago.\"\nMr Greenwell would ask for clarification of years or centuries which C.A.V would reply with \"Well, I couldn't say. They said a long time, a long time ago they had overcome the defects of our planet. They told me that they extracted from the sun...I learned later that this is called photosynthesis--which I did not know. the sun, which is the chief source of all energy, provided them with all their necessary energy. They obtained humidity from the atmosphere.\"\nAgain during this conversation as C.A.V asked the entities how they traveled across space \"\nV: No. The name they gave me was strange and unknown to me...I asked them what propulsion method they employed to cross space. They said that, at will, they could add or subtract weight from their vehicle. They accumulated energy through a heat system. Well, I don't understand it at all, but they said it was a method of changes in temperature which created some sort of energy. They said that we had to swallow, digest, and convert our food into energy, whilst they received their energy directly from the sun. They also said they did not practice sex. they said they had no sexes any more or sexual desires, and had no sex problems like us humans. They never felt hunger, which did not make them envious of their brothers. Everything belonged to everyone, while the humans on earth fought over silly things like flags and lands. I then asked them if they had no sex, how did they reproduce? They said that they had the ability to divide themselves down the middle and split themselves into two creatures.\"\nC.A.V would then ask how they could survive traveling at high speeds without their bodies being harmed and one instructed C.A.V to touch him. From C.A.V \"I sort of put my arm around one and pressed his body and had the idea that, if I could make him stay, this would be my proof. You see, I was under a state of shock and was not thinking too clearly. I felt something sort of \"biscuity\"--they had hard bodies. They had no bones, apparently, but cartilages--this permitted them to receive all sorts of blows without damage. I asked them if they had hostile intentions toward us, and they said no; all that they wanted is that we stopped playing around with such a dangerous weapon.\"\nAt this point the entities invited C.A.V aboard the object itself, unlike other such UFO encounters, C.A.V had to physically pull himself into the craft as there was no ladder or steps (which was described as semi-circular), nor was he lifted by any sort of anti-graivty system. He would state that the inside of the craft was mostly empty besides a \"ledge\" that circled the whole interior of the craft. \nOnce C.A.V was inside the craft the entities made noises among themselves described as similar to static on a radio. These beings would then show C.A.V how they would share liquids between each other simply by placing their shoulders together. C.A.V was unsure whether or not this was water as we know it or some other type of bodily substance. But he was told that they receive such moisture from the atmosphere via humidity. \nInside the craft itself C.A.V would state this ledge and the encompassing area on the inside of the craft was transparent and curved towards the edges of the inside where the disc would naturally appeared to follow. And when asked by C.A.V the entities stated the \"ledge\" was all that was needed to accumulate  energy and to pilot the craft. \nThe craft then rose up as C.A.V could feel the process as it flew over the coast, stopped  and went back to its original position. C.A.V would remark that this felt \"rather fast\" and the entities stated they could travel and maneuver at higher speeds but C.A.V would be unable to survive it himself. \nAs they returned and \"landed\" back to their original position C.A.V would ask these entities to demonstrate this ability to split and divide to which they complied. One of these entities would lay down on the ground inside the craft and the middle section of the entity would begin to thin in the middle before splitting in half to form another identical being. The entities stated that the newly formed being retained all memories and knowledge of the original entity after splitting apart. C.A.V asked if they got bored of being \"eternal\" and that this process was a kind of catharsis for them. C.A.V would state that one of these entities was smaller in size than the original and remained that way for the remainder of the encounter. \nThen in a next step which might surprise many, C.A.V attempted to actually grab or capture one of these entities (stating that he was under some type of altered thought process, and that normally this would never be something he would consider otherwise). But when embracing the entity it released a type of soapy liquid that let it slip out of his arms. C.A.V stated that he believed if he had proof of this encounter by taking one of them that he could become rich. \nAt some point they agreed to return the following day in the same location with the requested \"chief\", the entities climbed aboard the craft (C.A.V did not recall how the door closed or if it did). C.A.V would remark how it left, stating \"no. It inclined at about thirty degrees, made a semicircle as if it were going toward the hills, turned toward the sea, picked up great speed and disappeared.\"\nThe entire encounter was as far as he could tell, about half an hour. \nC.A.V would later return to that area, however the entities did not return possibly due to the \"chief\" not being in tow with C.A.V but we can only speculate.", "media": null, "score": 100, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comment_count": 7, "over_18": false}, "10": {"id": "17t9fzk", "locked": false, "subreddit": "cryptids", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "scottdude8131", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1700279526.090513, "created_utc": 1699752700.0, "url": "https://v.redd.it/jkoq6snfltzb1", "title": "They found it.", "permalink": "/r/cryptids/comments/17t9fzk/they_found_it/", "selftext": "", "media": {"reddit_video": {"bitrate_kbps": 1200, "fallback_url": "https://v.redd.it/jkoq6snfltzb1/DASH_480.mp4?source=fallback", "has_audio": true, "height": 480, "width": 652, "scrubber_media_url": "https://v.redd.it/jkoq6snfltzb1/DASH_96.mp4", "dash_url": "https://v.redd.it/jkoq6snfltzb1/DASHPlaylist.mpd?a=1702871525%2COGNlOTM5Yzc2ZTVhMTIyZWQ3Y2YyNzc4YmZhZWRjOWUzYThlMDA4MzM0MjYyM2NjZmE5OTMwYzA3YmYwYTljYQ%3D%3D&v=1&f=sd", "duration": 17, "hls_url": "https://v.redd.it/jkoq6snfltzb1/HLSPlaylist.m3u8?a=1702871525%2CNTg1MWZiODQ1MTM3NDQ4MWMwZDZiZWQwNzBmZTQ5ODNkZmY1M2RjMjAwOTRlNzRiMTQ1MzUwYzQ4NjEyNmQ0Zg%3D%3D&v=1&f=sd", "is_gif": false, "transcoding_status": "completed"}}, "score": 2725, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comment_count": 133, "over_18": false}, "11": {"id": "17wqpp2", "locked": false, "subreddit": "thetruthishere", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "spooky_b1tch", "link_flair_text": "Shadow People", "time": 1700279526.331608, "created_utc": 1700151243.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/17wqpp2/i_saw_something_when_i_was_a_kid/", "title": "I saw something when I was a kid", "permalink": "/r/Thetruthishere/comments/17wqpp2/i_saw_something_when_i_was_a_kid/", "selftext": "When I was in elementary school, I lived in a house that creeped me out from day 1. I never felt comfortable there. I always felt like I was being watched. I refused to even sleep in my own room because my room gave me extreme bad vibes. I cannot explain why I felt so uncomfortable in that house so immediately, but the vibes were completely off.\nMy animals also reacted poorly to the house. My dogs would bark and growl at nothing, and would stand over me at night as if they were protecting me from something. Sometimes I'd hear weird things and the dogs would also react, so I knew it wasn't just me. \nWhen I was around 9, I was sitting in the livingroom floor and playing with some toys while I watched TV. My grandma was passed out in the chair near me. I heard something, thought it was my dog, and turned to look at the hallway. I saw a tall, black shadow figure move from the hallway, across the livingroom, right in front of me, and through the side door to the side patio. I was extremely freaked out and ran off to go look for my dogs for comfort. They were in the backyard, so the sound couldn't have been them, and nobody else was in the house. \nI often slept in the guest room, for some reason it felt safer than my own room did. The window in the guest room overlooked the side patio that the shadow figure went through the door to. Almost every night, without fail, my dogs would bark and growl at that window amd stand over me or lay directly on me, as if they were protecting me from something. After this incident, I didn't feel truly safe anywhere I slept. I would be up most of the night, too creeped out to fall entirely asleep. \nOther things happened in this house too, but that was most notable for me as it was the first time I saw something unexplainable. I was not asleep. I've never had sleep paralysis. I do not have schizophrenia. What I saw completely changed how I viewed the world. I've had a lot of unexplainable experiences since then, but this one shaped my beliefs in a major way. \nHas anybody else seen shadow people/shadow figures?", "media": null, "score": 176, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comment_count": 48, "over_18": false}, "12": {"id": "17vj4u7", "locked": false, "subreddit": "letsnotmeet", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Userrnotfoundd", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1700279526.5852308, "created_utc": 1700014669.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/17vj4u7/kidnapped_and_zip_tied/", "title": "Kidnapped and zip tied", "permalink": "/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/17vj4u7/kidnapped_and_zip_tied/", "selftext": "So now that the case is over and I can talk about it freely, I figured I would share my story of the time I got kidnapped. (This happened in 2021)\nI was 20 at the time and I had just got off work around 11pm and went straight home to get ready to go out and meet my friend at the strip club. He messaged me via fb messenger to hang out and smoke and I told him that I was meeting a friend and didn\u2019t want to hang out, so he offered to drive me to/from the strip club. \nWell, around 1230am he came to pick me up and said he had to dump some some garbage first (he had a couch on the back of the pickup truck bed which I assumed was the \u201cgarbage\u201d he was talking about) he said he made us \u2018margaritas\u2019 but I told him I didn\u2019t want to drink till I got to my destination so we ended up just smoking marijuana on the way to dump the couch, it was about a 25-30min car ride to where he wanted to dump this couch and by the time we made it to the destination it was about 1:15am. \nThere was logging road just off to the side of the highway that goes for miles. He pulled all the way down to the end and left the couch there then got back in the truck and started driving back towards the highway but once we got halfway back to the highway he stopped and put his truck in park then pulled out a pipe and started smoking more marijuana. \nAfter taking a hit, he turned his head to me and stared at me for a minute with a weird smirk on his face, then all of a sudden he almost looked like he wanted to jump at me but stopped himself in the moment with his hands in a motion that he was about to grab me (I got I scared at this point and was frozen in shock not knowing if it was a joke or not) I quickly realized it was NOT a joke and opened my door like I was about to get out and he did the same. I closed my door and he closed his too, we ended up playing door tag and eventually he got tired of it and got out of the truck and ran to my side (I was in the passenger seat) he opened my door and tried pulling me out by my legs, as I was trying to kick him I pulled my phone out to call the police and of course my Face ID didn\u2019t want to work in that moment and he ended up snatching the phone out of my hands. I kicked him hard enough in the chest and he FLEW backwards falling to his butt. I grabbed my purse and hopped out the truck and started running toward the highway, I kept looking back to see how far behind me he was and he gave me a head start before running after me, grabbing me by the back of my shoulders and forcefully throwing me into the ditch. \nI landed on my stomach with one leg straight out and the other one was bent at a weird angle, he sat on top of my legs/butt and was holding my left hand behind my back. I screamed and begged him to bring me home and that I wouldn\u2019t tell anyone, he got upset that I was screaming and tried suffocating me with his other hand while still holding my left hand behind my back. I kept trying to pull his hands off my face with my right hand because it got to the point where I couldn\u2019t breathe, finally he let go of my face and I turned my head around to see what he was doing and to my surprise I watched him pull zip ties out of his front Jean pocket.. he zip tied my hands behind my back then tried forcefully pulling my panties off me (I had on a skirt and was still laying on my stomach) I remember digging my knees into the ground so he couldn\u2019t get them off, he didn\u2019t. He got up and started pacing saying \u201cit shouldn\u2019t have happened this way just do what I say\u201d I cried telling him if he was going to do anything to me then put me back into the truck and he did. Not going to go into detail about this part of the story but what I did notice was he pulled out a really small ziplock baggie out of his Jean pocket and pulled out a CONDOM!! (He took the condom out of the actual wrapper it came in and put it in a really small ziplock baggie) I asked him what it was and he said \u201cit\u2019s for protection\u201d. \nAfter all that went down he got back in the truck (mind you I\u2019m still tied up) and he drove back to the highway and started driving around. I made up every excuse to get him to take them off me and he wouldn\u2019t. I asked for a cigarette (I don\u2019t even smoke cigarettes) and he lit one, smoked on it a bit then held it up to my mouth saying \u201cI\u2019ll hold it for you\u201d at this point I thought to myself \u201cwhat can I do to  get myself out of this situation?\u201d I thought I was going to die. \nI started saying things like \u201cyou can be my sugar daddy and I will pay to take us out to dinner tomorrow, if p**** is all you wanted from me you could have just said that\u201d he loved it so much he started saying he would put me on his life insurance policy so when he dies I get can the money. Eventually, I asked him again if he would take the zip ties off (they were on so tight it was cutting my circulation) he pulled to the side of the road and pulled out a mini pocket knife from his car keys and cut them off me. It took a few tries because of how tight they were and gave me my phone back. I had an Apple Watch on my wrist and asked him for it after noticing it wasn\u2019t on my wrist anymore and he had this surprised look on his face and said \u201cWE NEED TO GO BACK AND GET IT\u201d he turned around and headed back to where all of that just happened at.\nI got so scared and thought to myself \u201cyep. this is it. I\u2019m going to die tonight and nobody will know until somebody finds my dead body\u201d once we got there, he told me to stay in the truck and he got out and searched the ditch for my watch. He came back to the truck after 5min and said he couldn\u2019t find but it would be back in the morning to look when it\u2019s light outside. We got back on the highway and headed back to town, once we got into town he asked me \u201cwhat do you want to do now?\u201d I said \u201cbring me to my mom\u2019s house I have to work in 4 hours and I\u2019m tired\u201d (it was about 430am by this time) and he brought me to my moms. After getting to my mom\u2019s house I looked up his name on google, and he was on parole for first Degree murder. \nHe had served 17 1/2 years in prison for murdering somebody for their life insurance policy. I\u2019m 22 now and I\u2019m so thankful I got to see another day.

I watched the 1931 Dracula and went to bed on Monday and randomly a random forest popped up which made me feel like I had to get away from that but I didn't know why.\nIt wasn't until I woke up and went looking through the old ritual game warehouse for what that could possibly be that I stumbled upon the Bath Game and the White Kimono games, I didn't read anything but preventative measures and the beginning steps to make sure I didn't actually start them subconsciously and I didn't or so I thought but later that same night, I got the vision of the Bath one slipping and falling in my kitchen with images like the Lazy Masquerade video and \"I accept.\" going in my head repeatedly while I just thought \"No, I don't accept.\"\nNow do bear in mind I have a good imagination and I haven't done any rituals to summon either, the only things that have popped into my dreams is some black-haired woman in a business suit and then one with an eye covering in my nightime thoughts before thoughts during the daytime of Kayako and Sadako.\nBear in mind I was nowhere near a bath-tub and thought that some spiritual banishing dealt with the problem if any but I've been looking over my right shoulder just in case, seen nothing like the descriptions of the Bath one though and even my two \"Kita!\" tries seemed to be just me losing it.\nBut I made a rather dumb decision to look into Yetiforestman's experiences with the Kimono one and while I know it wasn't a good idea, I had to make sure I was safe and while he does explicitly say you need to actually say the ritual and I didn't feel the warning signs he mentioned, I felt a wave of panic when someone put one of the ritual steps in the comments and I completely panicked with my chest pounding like a warning sign. I do think I have food poisoning from Arby's so that might lead to a lot of my discomfort and I didn't have any odd thoughts when I closed my eyes yesterday, plus, I don't get actual dreams except on rare ocassions do these are more like my mind showing me images I might want to or might not want to see.\nAnyways, the end result of this is me asking if I'm alright and not in any mortal peril?

I was 33 years old, and our apartment was a 4th floor walk up unit, very typical low budget chicago rental in a \"changing\" neighborhood. \nThe layout of our building is going to matter to this story. Our building had a total of 12 units, mine and the 3 below me had a shared front entrance, and the other 8 units were through a second entrance. All 12 apartments had connected back porches and stairs that shared a walkway to a rear gate, which lead to an alley. From the front stairwell, there are windows on each landing to the back porches, so you can see the back door of my apartment when standing at the front door through that window. \nWe had good relations with our neighbors, especially those that lived directly below us and shared our front door. This was the thing that saved all 3 of us (my partner, my dog, and me).\nMy partner was in a touring band at the time, and would leave for weekends or weeks at a time, and it was a scary thing for me bc I was SAed and stalked by an ex in my teens and twenties. I always worried something would tip him off and hed start stalking me again. \nA little less than a month before a 2 week tour my partner had scheduled, I received a creepy fb message from that stalker ex from yet another new account. About a week after that my car was broken into. The glove box was emptied, things were thrown around, but the only thing that was taken was a bag of dog treats. I had about $20 in change in the compartment between the seats, and they left the money. \nI was on HIGH ALERT at that point, and very scared about the time I'd be alone during the tour. My partner was kind of irritated with me and the situation and felt that it was too last minute to cancel, especially over what amounted to a bad feeling and a few isolated things that weren't direct threats. And truthfully car breakins are very very common in Chicago- its happened to me like 15 times and police usually do the reports over the phone and dont even come to the scene. What I found really strange was that the thief didn't take the money. There WAS a homeless man who had started camping on the blvd nearby recently.\nMy partner left for his tour, and I set up cameras and bought door braces for my front and back doors. I became completely nocturnal, unable to sleep at night. My poor dog developed diarrhea, maybe because she was picking up on my stress level. It meant that I was taking her down all 4 flights of stairs for her to go blast her bowels 6 or 7 times a night. \nI had the distinct prickly crawling sensation of being watched when i would take her out. But I couldn't tell what was genuine and what was my own fear and paranoia.\nHer diarrhea lasted an unusually long time, like 3 or 4 days. I was going in and out the main door a lot, feeling very scared, and I noticed that some of my neighbors wouldn't pull the door all the way closed, so the lock engaged. I mentioned it to my downstairs neighbor one day, including that i was extra careful bc of the stalker. He was supportive, said hed mention it to the other neighbors if he saw them, and i noticed that the door was locked more frequently after that.\nMy partner came home at about 11 am on a Sunday morning. At about 830 am that morning, my 1st floor neighbors place was burglarized. He was a metalhead dude who collected instruments, sold weed and psychedelics, and lived alone. I guess he went out for breakfast and he left his door unlocked while he was gone. Someone had come in, eaten the leftovers in his fridge, took a coat and pair of boots (and left a filthy coat and pair of boots), took his college diploma but left $500 in the same cabinet. They left all the expensive musical instruments and mixing equipment, left the drugs, but did take a set of keys. The keys were to the 1st floor apartment, and a master key for front door and the back gate.\nMy neighbors ran into each other right after the break in, and the 2nd floor neighbor said to \"go tell No-doughnut because she has a stalker\". So my metal head neighbor came up to let me know what had happened.\nMy partner had just gotten home from his tour when he knocked at the front door. I jumped out of my skin but looked through the peep hole, recognized him, and the 3 of us stood on the stairs at my front door while he told us about the breakin.\nWe jabberjawed for awhile, about 15-20 minutes. While we were talking we heard the front door open and close below us but thought nothing of it.\nThen we saw a man climbing up my back porch steps to my back door through the window.\nThere was no other apartment he could have been going to, and he had to walk past all 11 more accessible units on his way to mine.\nHe was not my stalker/I did not recognize him, but his image is burned in my mind. He was wearing flashy black and white high top sneakers (not the ones stolen from downstairs), his black coat was oversized and hanging off his shoulders. \nWe locked eyes through the window and he froze halfway up the stairs to my back porch. He slowly took a cell phone and called someone as he slowly turned around halfway up the steps. He walked back down the stairs in artificially slow-motion, like he was pretending to be nonchalant, and then bolted into a sprint as soon as he hit the porch below mine.\nMy neighbor ran downstairs and dialed 911. My partner and I ran through the apartment to the back porch and saw a sedan and a windowless van pull out from the sketchy building two doors down. Both cars floored it out of the alley. We didn't get the plates. But the cops said it wouldn't have mattered- there wasn't any crime committed and nothing concrete to justify stopping them. They very condescendingly explained this to me as they took my statement later. My neighbor is the one who actually made the call and has the police report, my partner and I were just considered witnesses.\nFor a long time the thing that scared me the most was the \"tool\" that my neighbor found when he went running downstairs. It was a 2x4 piece of wood, cut to about 2 feet, but about 6 inches of it had been made into a handle. It looked like a paddle and for a long time I couldn't figure out what it was, but I'm pretty sure it was a ram for the door jamb/locks. When I looked at my door afterward, it looked like the frame had been repaired. Like it had been broken open before. It seems like they used the one master key to place their ram, get somebody at the back door to catch me if I tried to run out that way, and somebody else was going to come back around (since they only had one key) and they'd break in my front door and go forward with whatever they had planned. \nWhen we caught them before they could catch me unaware, they seemed to have aborted the plan. I suspect they'd been watching me, especially while I was taking out my dog, and figured that I was alone. It was pure coincidence that my partner had gotten home 30 minutes before all this. I feel that we all could have been horribly injured or worse had we been trapped inside and they had gotten the jump on us. \nNothing else ever came of it, except that my landlord refused to change the locks but he did agree to let us out of our lease. I moved out of Chicago and now have added a younger dog I'm training to do some bitework. My house is surrounded by cameras and floodlights and wingnut neighbors. \nSo whoever was on my back porch and whatever they had planned: let's not meet.", "media": null, "score": 159, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comment_count": 11, "over_18": true}, "28": {"id": "17xa7z3", "locked": false, "subreddit": "truecreepy", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "MisterMysteriesYT", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1700279539.3094747, "created_utc": 1700208258.0, "url": "https://youtu.be/zvC8p9kDB5o", "title": "Ted Bundy killed at least 30 victims over the course of 4 years, but his true body count could be over 100...", "permalink": "/r/truecreepy/comments/17xa7z3/ted_bundy_killed_at_least_30_victims_over_the/", "selftext": "", "media": {"type": "youtube.com", "oembed": {"provider_url": "https://www.youtube.com/", "version": "1.0", "title": "Ted Bundy: America's Most Notorious Serial Killer | True Crime", "type": "video", "thumbnail_width": 480, "height": 200, "width": 356, "html": "<iframe width=\"356\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zvC8p9kDB5o?feature=oembed&enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen title=\"Ted Bundy: America&#39;s Most Notorious Serial Killer | True Crime\"></iframe>", "author_name": "Mister Mysteries", "provider_name": "YouTube", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zvC8p9kDB5o/hqdefault.jpg", "thumbnail_height": 360, "author_url": "https://www.youtube.com/@Mister_Mysteries"}}, "score": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "comment_count": 0, "over_18": false}, "29": {"id": "17x05vk", "locked": false, "subreddit": "threekings", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "llamalucky", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1700279539.5229416, "created_utc": 1700175618.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/threekings/comments/17x05vk/creation_of_ritualsgames/", "title": "Creation of rituals/games?", "permalink": "/r/threekings/comments/17x05vk/creation_of_ritualsgames/", "selftext": "Hello fellow people!

Maybe go to some well-known paranormal places etc. \nIf you guys have any comments or helpful tips on maybe combining rituals of sorts, please let me know! or if you have a site with more rituals I would love to see it!

My mother was the only other person in the house, and I know for a fact that she was asleep at the time. The sound that I heard didn't sound like adult footsteps; they sounded more lightweight and rapid like that of a scampering toddler. And no, there were no pets in the household.\nMy bedroom was at the dead end of the hallway, and these scampering footsteps would repeatedly run from one end of the hall to the other, but every time they reached the end where my bedroom was situated, there would be a momentary pause in front of my door before resuming. This exact same cycle repeated for about five minutes, and then it just abruptly ceased. I sat upright in my bed petrified with fear the entire time this was happening and was much too afraid to open the door during or after. I still have no idea what was making that sound, but I got a distinct feeling that whatever it was seemed to be aware that I was aware of its presence. Don't ask me how I know that; it's just one of those things that you can feel, but you can't rationally explain it.\nThe second incident occurred a few years later when I went down to the basement workshop to retrieve some tools. As I was standing in front of the pegboard selecting what I required, a female voice aggressively growled directly into my left ear. I immediately went into an adrenaline-fueled panic and dropped everything I had in my hands before sprinting out of the workshop and up the stairs like a frightened cat. Even remembering that now makes me feel an icy chill throughout my entire body like I did when it happened. That incident was far more traumatic than the previous one.\nI live in a city in Northwestern Canada that is somewhat remote, and the neighbourhood I grew up in is situated on land that was once an Indigenous village inhabited by the Lheidli T'enneh people. Their entire village was burned to the ground in 1913 by British colonizers who wanted to permanently drive them out of the area so they could annex the land. Make of that what you will. I don't know if it's connected in any way, but I thought that it might be worthwhile to mention it.\nHas anyone else ever experienced anything like either of these incidents?", "media": null, "score": 91, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comment_count": 9, "over_18": false}, "42": {"id": "17xp14j", "locked": false, "subreddit": "letsnotmeet", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "ale314159", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1700279551.7657557, "created_utc": 1700255059.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/17xp14j/stalker_followed_me_from_gym_and_i_am_terrified/", "title": "Stalker followed me from gym and I am terrified", "permalink": "/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/17xp14j/stalker_followed_me_from_gym_and_i_am_terrified/", "selftext": "I normally take a walk every friday to attend my weekly pilates class. It's a 15 minutes power walk from my apartment in a relatively safe city from Eastern Europe. I have never ever felt unsafe in my city and I wouldn't normally exercise caution when walking alone at night.\nTonight however after the end of class I began my usual walk back home and 5 minutes in and lot of corner cutting and alley shortcuts I notice that this strange looking man is still following me. The first glimse I got of him at that point was a young man in his 20s, incel looking, hat on, shiny elegant shoes on and a black coat. On a closer look he had a link chain ( the kind of CHAIN you use in heavy transportation and to pull heavy loads) around his neck. I instantly got shivers down my spine and changed my pace of walking to very slowly than very fast to check if he does too. He changed his as well and I could see from the corner of my eye he was still behind me. He was also on the phone and I got the feeling he was taking pictures of me.\nAt this point I completely freaked out, but my first thought was that I was athletic enough to put up with this creep and that I need to stay focus. I was on the main boulevard parallel from my apartment and I decided to turn right in a a very fast and abrupt way. He kept on walking and I thought I was just crazy and it was all in my head, but 2 minutes later he was still behind me. I must  mention that there were people on the street at every corner so even if he wanted to attempt something it would have been virtually impossible. \nWhen I reached my apartment I entered the house very fast, checked if he wasnt behind me and that was it. However, the SCARY PART comes now: after an hour or so my husband checked our building's security camera and sow that as I rushed into the flat, this creep hid behind a car and stayed there for good minutes  watching the building. Afterwards he approached the entrance and took a picture of the entrance and the address engraved on it. \nI am now scared he will start stalking me and my family.

I hope this is the correct format, apologies for the length. \nMy older sister and I shared a room while we were young. Our room was at the end of a hall, but the doorway faced another door at the end of the hall - not the actual length of the hall. We had a bunk bed at this time and I had the bottom bunk that had a curtain around the top perimeter of my space while my sister had the open space top bunk.\nI often woke my sister up because I heard my mother calling my name. We would ask my mom in the morning why she called for us in the middle of the night but my mom denied it.\nA few years later, my sister moved into her own room and I had a terrible fear of the dark. By this time, my sister slept with her door closed and locked. Whenever I woke in the middle of the night, I would run to my brother\u2019s room on the other side of the house and sleep on the stretch of carpeted floor between his bed and the wall. \nOne night, I heard my mother call my name again. I ran as quickly as I could to my brother\u2019s room and settled into my usual spot. When I looked up, I saw an apparition that appeared as a glowing blue transparent woman in a long dress with what looked to be a veil. The clothing was blowing in the wind, but the room was unnaturally still. I remember thinking that it was so still that my heart wasn\u2019t beating and I wasn\u2019t breathing the entire time. The apparition was floating halfway over my brother and seemed to be just watching him sleep. It was at this moment that the apparition sharply looked to the left, where I was laying, and  disappeared. I can visualize that exact moment in perfect detail today - 35 years later. \nMy mother passed away in 2018 after a long illness. The bed that she passed in just happened to be the room that was once my brother\u2019s, where I saw the apparition. My sister and I were discussing the incidents that we encountered in our childhood home and she reminded me that she also saw the woman I did - while we were sharing a bedroom. She didn\u2019t tell me at the time, but one of the nights that she heard my mother calling her name in the middle of the night she kept watching the door, instead of hiding under the covers per usual. The description of what she saw matched the woman that I saw, all the way down to the dress blowing in non-existent wind.\nI\u2019m not sure what it is we both saw, or why the figure used my mother\u2019s voice. I like to think that my mother\u2019s spirit broke the laws of time and visited us throughout our childhood- but I haven\u2019t seen anything like it again.", "media": null, "score": 29, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comment_count": 2, "over_18": false}, "55": {"id": "17u3z70", "locked": false, "subreddit": "letsnotmeet", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "tiefegg", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1700279565.1197555, "created_utc": 1699854026.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/17u3z70/ceiling_walker/", "title": "Ceiling Walker", "permalink": "/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/17u3z70/ceiling_walker/", "selftext": "It\u2019s been about ten years since this happened, but I still remember things pretty clearly. I should note that this is told from my perspective, and I wish I could get my mother\u2019s perspective on it as well; she just doesn\u2019t remember the events as well as I do. For context, I lived in a mid-sized city in the southern United States, where the main thing to do at the time was go to the mall. Sure, we had movie theaters and a couple of bowling alleys, but besides that, there really wasn\u2019t much to the city.\nMy mom worked at a department store located in the mall, and, having nothing better to do, I would regularly go and sit in the break room while she worked. It gave me a reason to get out of the house, and if I wanted to, I was allowed to walk around the mall or get something to snack on in the food court. Honestly, though, I was shy and preferred to just stay cooped up in the break room, playing video games on my Nintendo 3DS. My mom\u2019s coworkers were generally very sweet to me and frequently popped in to say hello or just to check on me during downtime. \nIf I was lucky enough to go with my mom on weekends, I could usually convince my mom to pick up my \u201cfriend\u201d (we were actually dating, but since we were both girls, I didn\u2019t want that to get out) to go along with us. Going to the mall meant I was free from doing chores at home, and it was a cheap way to sneak a secret date in every now and then. My girlfriend, though, never really liked staying in the break room with me; she always wanted to walk around the mall. I should note that she really enjoyed taking walks, so it wasn\u2019t out of the ordinary to want to do so at the mall as well; I just didn\u2019t like walking as much as she did, so I tried to weasel my way out of it whenever I could. \nI could usually convince her to just walk over to a nearby store and look around or to go grab something from the food court rather than walking, but I noticed pretty quickly that she wasn\u2019t trying to actually get me to walk around; she just didn\u2019t want to be in the break room. Now, my girlfriend was more perceptive to things than I was, and I assumed she just didn\u2019t like the ambiance of the break room for some reason. \nFor a little while, I let it go, but eventually, I got frustrated and asked directly: what was really bothering her about the break room? I thought she was going to tell me that it was too cramped or the lights randomly cutting off made her uneasy- the things that bothered me about it too- but no. What she told me was that she heard things in the ceiling, like someone was walking around in there. I had learned from my mother that there was a room in the ceiling, but it wasn\u2019t for walking around; it was for maintenance. Most of the stuff in there was wiring and insulation, but, technically, someone could go up there, so I told my girlfriend this and said it was likely an employee up there to fix stuff. \nShe said that was fine, but she didn\u2019t really like it and still preferred walking around or sitting in the food court. I understood her discomfort and wanted to help, so I agreed; we had a really good relationship in the sense of communication and, though I got frustrated, I wanted to make sure she felt comfortable. \nLater that day, I mentioned what my girlfriend had told me and asked what they were fixing in the ceiling. Though, my mom just looked distressed and said they hadn\u2019t been up there fixing anything that day, but she wanted me to see something. My mom took me into the receiving room of the department store, which was just a room off in the back filled with boxes and random junk the store was going to put out for sale. The layout of this room, though, was sort of an \u2018L\u2019 shape. One part of the \u2018L\u2019 was used for receiving, but the other part was the way into the ceiling. \nI should clarify for this next part that to get into the ceiling, the store would have to call for the mall\u2019s maintenance team; they didn\u2019t have a ladder or anything on hand to climb in there as it would have been a safety hazard. The only thing that this particular area had was a hatch that led into the ceiling- that was it. So needless to say, I was horrified to see what appeared to be claw marks leading up the wall to the hatch. \nI still remember the way they looked: brown gashes that had been dug into the concrete wall of the receiving room. I asked my mom if it was a prank, but she told me that this wasn\u2019t the first time it had happened, and she had no way of knowing I would even ask about it. According to her, these weird carvings had shown up several times over the course of a few months. Each time, the store would call in the mall\u2019s security and maintenance teams who would clean the wall up and then go into the ceiling to investigate. Nothing had ever come of their searches, though, and they eventually gave up dealing with the marks. \nThe only explanation mall security could give was that it was likely a homeless individual who had made their way into the ceiling by sheer willpower and happened to be very good at hiding during the searches. I stopped staying at the mall with my mom after that, and any time I wanted my girlfriend to come over, we found somewhere else to go during the day. Sometimes she\u2019d just come over to my house and we\u2019d watch TV or whatever, but I didn\u2019t feel safe going back to the break room after that.

I started posting my own content for the first while and mostly didn't wander away from r/conspiracy, but after a year or two I slowly found a few other subreddits that made me laugh like r/oddlyterrifying and r/technicallythetruth. I decided to start experimenting with posts like videos, comics and memes just to see what was popular among the masses of various subreddits, and what was not.\nLong story short, I've accumulated an additional 300,000 Karma (or over 1,000,000 likes) in roughly 18 months and I've learned a ton about how this website operates. I've made the front page of Reddit 7 times, 4 of those being top 10 and one of those hitting #1 briefly. (I even got a special invite to the most boring, censored subreddit you can imagine for hitting #1.) I'm don't really care about Karma, it means absolutely nothing, but I DO like experimenting on Reddit in the sense of trying to get a pulse on how redditors think and feel. \nI want to focus on two big things I'm certain of now.\n#1: Reddit doesn't care what is popular, only what is politically correct. You can have a video going viral right away and be appropriate for a subreddit, but if the video has a chance of hitting the front page, moderators of *some* sort make another check to see if they WANT it to hit the front page. If they don't, the post gets scrubbed before it happens. Just so you know... the front page of Reddit is NOT popular opinion. It's heavily censored and posts only make it to the front page if they are Reddit approved. I know this from firsthand experience with absolute certainty. I probably would have had double the posts I've had hit the front page if it wasn't for this. Also, this kind of censorship extends to subreddits as well, but some can still be good unless you start going potentially front page viral.\n#2: Without any doubt in my mind now, Reddit has bots that will downvote certain kind of content, in particular during the first hour. There is a strange phenomena that happens across the board on any subreddit. The vast majority of dislikes come at the very beginning. If you can survive an initial onslaught of having your \"like\" ratio be as low as 65% (assuming the post has traction), within a few hours it will be above 80%. By the end of a 24 hour period, it will be up to 90-95%. The rational question to ask is, \"where are all the haters after the first hour?\" If these people were real, the ratio wouldn't skew so much in the beginning. The ratio of people who disliked something would remain more constant hours later, but it never, ever does. The reason this actually happens is because there are bots that discourage certain kind of content. The pattern is the same in virtually *every* subreddit.  \nBasically, Reddit is truly doing everything in its power to cause the public to believe its USERS think and act a certain manner, but the truth is the average redditor's worldview is simply not represented in the algorhythm. Certain opinions or ideas get traction and others do not. Just remember, even though Reddit is a collection of users, we do not get a version of this place that is an accurate representation of how said users think and feel. \nI can think of many reasons this happens, but I would say one of the biggest ones is to dishearten us. There are FAR more of us sane, open, zany, rational types than Reddit wants us to believe, and by us believing we are in a minority rather than a majority causes manyto dishearten and turn away from the fight. Why go to war when you can deceive your opponents into thinking the enemy's army is much bigger than it is and take away their will to fight? \nSo I'm here to tell you after fucking around with Reddit's algorhythms on various subreddits, we're not really the minority, we're just made to believe it. And on the flip-side, the minority is convinced they are the majorty. Funny, how that works.\nCheers.\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b", "media": null, "score": 1555, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "comment_count": 298, "over_18": false}, "64": {"id": "17uup54", "locked": false, "subreddit": "bigfoot", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "rabidsaskwatch", "link_flair_text": "squatchy environments ", "time": 1700279575.927667, "created_utc": 1699937677.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/17uup54", "title": "I gave in, left this inn a national forest with a lot of reports", "permalink": "/r/bigfoot/comments/17uup54/i_gave_in_left_this_inn_a_national_forest_with_a/", "selftext": "I know the odds are slim but you never know, feels good to be proactive.

It was around 9:15pm on a Saturday. That night I decided to go on a run since I had just started going on a diet and trying to go on a more healthy path. The park this occurred in was very close to my neighborhood, and it interconnected other neighborhoods that were nearby mine. I don\u2019t recall why I wanted to run through a dark park at night, but I know I won\u2019t anymore. The moment I entered the park I noticed it was empty. Or at least I thought. I ran for about 6-8 minutes until I needed to catch my breath, in fact I was so exhausted from running I was hunched over practically panting. The moment I erected myself I immediately noticed a shirtless man sitting on a park bench. The park lamp was illuminating him. Not even 2 seconds go by and immediately he looks up from his cellphone. Almost like he was watching me before I had even noticed he was sitting there. Creeped out, I turn around and begin \nheading home. I didn\u2019t feel like running anymore anyway. Maybe 10ish seconds later I turn around again and the man\u2019s gone. I didn\u2019t think much of it at first until I started to hear rustling? It sounded like grass. The section of the park I was in had a huge forest on one side of the path, the other had a mass of cut grass with houses visible in the distance. It sounded like it could\u2019ve been an animal, I hoped it was. It happened once, then it stopped, then it happened again, the second time scared me. I was genuinely afraid at that point. For some ungodly reason I stop in my tracks and just stand still. The rustling stops. Almost like whatever was lurking in the dark woods was moving in unison with me. The thing that traumatized me the most, out of EVERYTHING that occurred, was while I was standing still, the dead silence was broken with what sounded like heavy breathing coming from the woods. At that point I didn\u2019t hesitate and sprinted for my house. When I got to the entrance to the park, I heard distant groaning coming from behind me. I wasn\u2019t noticeable given the distance.
