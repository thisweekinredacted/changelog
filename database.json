There are a couple of possibilities for his continuous denial: \n\n\nHe is brainwashed by the rigged science and lies we have been fed for half a century about space, gravity, and extraterrestrials. This has caused him to defend this narrative of lies because his entire belief system and career is based on those lies and disinformation. \n\n\nHe is like Albert Einstein and many other scientists, including the man who created the original Cosmos show and the golden plates for the Voyager crafts (Carl Sagan). Also, the former Nazi scientist Wernher von Braun who created the rockets for Nasa. And many many other scientist who know the truth - UFOs and Extraterrestrials are real - but continue to lie, mislead, withhold, or spread disinformation on the subject. \n\n\nWhy would they do this? They are paid and make a comfortable living off of spreading the disinformation narrative. This is the same with many others who have been paid off by the CIA and other agencies for decades. If not paid directly, they receive jobs, incentives, TV shows, government funding, and other sources of financial benefit with the help of government entities and those in the know. In some instances, if they do not cooperate, then their careers and possibly even their lives are ruined and ended. Von Braun would have been imprisoned. Einstein would be a no name, Sagan would have been shelved, etc., etc. \nIf you don't think this is true, then you haven't done enough research on this subject. Several former intelligence officials have explained in detail how scientists, journalists, TV producers, and many politicians have been on the government's payroll for a long time to spread disinformation. \n\nThis goes even more sinister but has a lot of credibility to it. NOTE: I will write this using the simplest terms and analogy possible. \n\nThere are alien species here on Earth that have been on this planet long before humans. Let's call them the \"bad\" aliens. There are other \"good\" alien species (some are human-like in origin from other planets across the cosmos) who actually seeded this planet with beings like humans, animals, etc in hopes of making this planet a positive, loving, and happy place to thrive. This has been happening since the beginning of time as we understand it. \nHere is the issue both the \"bad\" and \"good\" aliens are in a universal race to spread their version of life across the galaxies and planets. The bad aliens who rule and control Earth have capabilities beyond your wildest dreams. Using such capabilities, they do everything in their power to ensure there is constant chaos, division, hate, anger, war, murder, etc, etc., going on between the beings on this planet. They essentially thrive and feed off such energy and it ensures we never sway too far over to the \"good\" side. \nI hate to say it, but these bad aliens have people like Neil deGrasse Tyson and many others in their pocket. This goes really deep but you get the idea, I hope. This spread far and wide from academia to business, politics, and more. \nHere is the important part. We are at a point now where the people and positive forces are starting to build momentum to expose the truths I have laid out for you above and much more. Unfortunately, the bad aliens will do everything in their power not to lose control of a planet (Earth) that they consider theirs. In the past, this has led to considerable disasters and destruction; and the wiping out of the intelligent species (humans on Earth) who have awoken to the reality they are living in. \nThe way the bad aliens look at it. It's better to wipe out the species and start fresh than to be exposed and forced to lose their territory. However, there are many other factors and rules at play. With several other species who are good, monitoring and intervene on earthly human's behalf. There is a kind of \"UN\" (The Galatic Federation and others) with both good and bad species having \"veto\" power. Earth and humans on this planet are at an infliction point between the \"the powers that be\" and its getting very interesting! \nOkay, I've gone pretty deep with all this, but I tried to do it in the simplest terms possible. If all of this sounds like straight nonsense, or out of a movie, or completely made up to you, then I highly advise you to stop listening to me or what other people say and do your own research. And I will help you with that. Below, I will provide two amazing links with all the proof and hard concrete data that you need to wrap you're head around all this. There is A LOT there so take your time with it and the truth will start to click. \nWhether people like it or not, alien disclosure is coming soon and it's better that you realize all the things you thought were impossible dealing with the subject of aliens, UFOs, space, etc., are actually a reality! \nLink 1.

This was mostly all private citizens. As in professors, lawyers, business people, a few scientists, retired military, current fbi, and other government agency members. In the end, we were allowed to allowed to ask questions. Some asked him about this, and what he said was that he was part of an extremely secret program that had figured out how to track and find uap's in our atmosphere and near earth orbit. He said his oped will include much more details regarding this.\nIt was hosted by a wall street big wigs and his lawyer friend. It was sort of a small saloon style talm. David also did it for free. Even went as far as to fly in to NYC just for this. He had arrived only a few hours beforehand and then left 1st thing the next day. The idea was to get a group of both skeptics and believers from all these different walks of life for a talk regarding David and the things he has said. Most of the people that left had left as believers. Or at the very least believed that David was not lying and truly believed everything he said. He also mentioned a few other things that I haven't heard him say before. Like that, he was told about a uap that was in our possession that had a diameter of around 40 ft, but once u went inside, it was the size of a football field. They believed that the object was somehow able to manipulate both space and time. He also said that the objec wast both using and creating energy that was more than a terrawatt when measured. Which is an absolutely ridiculous amount of power, something along the Iines of 1,000,000,000,000 watts. He also mentioned that he had recently been informed that a US adversary was considering full disclosure to get out ahead of the US and that he passed this information along to the US government. He also alluded to the retaliation that wqs had taken against him. It sounded pretty terrifying, and he wasn't the only one to be retaliated against. Multiple people involved in not only his investigation but also his fellow peers in the uap task force, such as Jay stratton, were also threatened. He wouldn't go too much into since it's an open investigation , but these people pretty showed him that they could touch him or his family any time they wanted. He also mentioned that the US has taken part in a fair amount of crash retrevials before 1933. Also that we wouldn't be surprised by what the NHI look like, such as they look like the typical grey and they aren't sure where these being have come from. There is also a chance that they are extra dimensional, but that it could also just seem this way because of the technology they use rather than them being actual extra dimensional beings. Interestingly, he also mentioned how many people know the full scope of the phenomenon to be no more then 50 people, but it wasn't clear whether this meant 50 people currently alive or 50 people ever in history. All in all, it was extremely interesting and pretty hopeful for the future of disclosure ( This was after the uap amendment was shut down.) and that he believes we will know much more in the near future.\nAnd apparently, it was the only private non goverment talk that he has done so far. As for how I feel about everything after hearing him speak. He is extremely smart, I mean, he has an almost unbelievable memory and knowledge about intel laws and other things that have to do with uap's. My opinion is that he is the real deal. Almost everyone left that night with fully believing what he was saying or, at the very least, that HE believed what he was saying as the truth. So, eithier way you cut it, I believe he is telling the truth as he knows it.\nAbout how they tracked UAP: No, i believe he said that this had something to do with a frequency that they can track or some kind of signature", "media": null, "score": 488, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comment_count": 110, "over_18": false}, "20": {"id": "1905xin", "locked": false, "subreddit": "conspiracy", "stickied": false, "category": "Consipiracy", "author": "TheForce122", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1705126827.8868468, "created_utc": 1704564334.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/xum65i9s0vac1.gif", "title": "Never forget... the worst terrorist attack in US history", "permalink": "/r/conspiracy/comments/1905xin/never_forget_the_worst_terrorist_attack_in_us/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 2843, "upvote_ratio": 0.74, "comment_count": 1232, "over_18": false}, "21": {"id": "1954im0", "locked": false, "subreddit": "conspiracyfact", "stickied": false, "category": "Consipiracy", "author": "forhealthy", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1705126828.4373786, "created_utc": 1705090290.0, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk2ZCFp9miw", "title": "Clear video footage of a UFO, It looks like an octopus in the sky of Mexico.", "permalink": "/r/conspiracyfact/comments/1954im0/clear_video_footage_of_a_ufo_it_looks_like_an/", "selftext": "", "media": {"type": "youtube.com", "oembed": {"provider_url": "https://www.youtube.com/", "version": "1.0", "title": "Clear video footage of a UFO, It looks like an octopus in the sky of Mexico.", "type": "video", "thumbnail_width": 480, "height": 200, "width": 356, "html": "<iframe width=\"356\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vk2ZCFp9miw?feature=oembed&enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen title=\"Clear video footage of a UFO, It looks like an octopus in the sky of Mexico.\"></iframe>", "author_name": "Minute To Know", "provider_name": "YouTube", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vk2ZCFp9miw/hqdefault.jpg", "thumbnail_height": 360, "author_url": "https://www.youtube.com/@minutetoknow88"}}, "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "comment_count": 0, "over_18": false}, "22": {"id": "194hzgl", "locked": false, "subreddit": "bigfoot", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "casablanca123456789", "link_flair_text": "humor", "time": 1705126829.310205, "created_utc": 1705021134.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/pzym19v7rwbc1.jpeg", "title": "Facts", "permalink": "/r/bigfoot/comments/194hzgl/facts/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 169, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "comment_count": 11, "over_18": false}, "23": {"id": "192g6lq", "locked": false, "subreddit": "cryptozoology", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "EmronRazaqi69", "link_flair_text": "Discussion ", "time": 1705126829.970249, "created_utc": 1704811182.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/j0cgo8tr9cbc1.jpeg", "title": "Am I the only one that finds Cryptozoology somewhat Depressing & Sad {READ COMMENT BELOW}", "permalink": "/r/Cryptozoology/comments/192g6lq/am_i_the_only_one_that_finds_cryptozoology/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 213, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comment_count": 34, "over_18": false}, "24": {"id": "193reic", "locked": false, "subreddit": "humanoidencounters", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "The_Titam", "link_flair_text": "Bedroom", "time": 1705126830.1290827, "created_utc": 1704942554.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Humanoidencounters/comments/193reic/both_me_and_my_cat_saw_a_shadow_person/", "title": "Both me and my cat saw a shadow person.", "permalink": "/r/Humanoidencounters/comments/193reic/both_me_and_my_cat_saw_a_shadow_person/", "selftext": "I have never experienced seeing shadow people until I saw one a few weeks ago.

I'd love to hear if anyone has any other similar stories!\nIn the first grade, I slept over at my friend's house. We had done a lot of fairy \"hunting\" activity, more like trying to summon them. we made fairy houses, watched tinker bell, chanted, anything that you could imagine. So, I wake up and check my surroundings to see if anything had changed since I had gone to bed. In my peripheral vision I see a little figure more-or-less hovering above the ground, it was smaller than a finger. It was black and had wings. My shoe, with laces, was sitting on the ground and the bedroom door was open. The figure flew out the door, but on its way out it grabbed my shoelace and pulled my shoe onto its side and closer to the door. Unfortunately, my friend did not see it and she still does not believe me because her sister had been the one responding to our fairy letters the whole time. But it would have been impossible for her sister to have done it.\nThe second time I saw one (around 5th grade), it was a very similar experience. I was outside in the carport, when once again I saw something in my peripheral. A small black figure hovering above the ground. Flying very fast. I saw it go into some short shrubs, (it was not windy) and I heard and saw it push the leaves out of its way. My sister was there, but once again did not see it.\nLastly, in high school, I dove back into fairies. I researched them and did all the things to try and interact with them again. I was outside during twilight with my friend, literally talking about them when we heard the most magical, peculiar sound which to us, sounded like it was coming from an old tree stump. Imagine if maybell flowers (lilly of the valley) could ring, and there were 1000s of them. That is what we heard, a soft and higher pitch-ish sound. We BOTH heard it. We go to investigate where it is coming from, and there are no birds or bugs that we can see. Neither of us had heard a sound like it before, nor have we heard one since.

She\u2019s 4 and was waking up in the middle of the night, getting into things she\u2019s not supposed to. Of course, right? So I installed a hallway camera to alert her dad and me of movement if she gets up in the middle of the night, and one night this was caught on camera. \nNow, I know the radiator looks rounded at the top, but there\u2019s a ridge on top that makes it flat. I had this roll of plastic sitting on top of it, for a few months or so, and I heard some noise one night around 12:30 in the morning, looked at the camera and she was awake. Told her to go back to bed. Then I heard a loud \u201cthunk\u201d a few minutes later, and I went up there to make sure she went to bed. \nI sent this to my mom one day saying this is what I\u2019ve been waking up to the last couple of weeks. Well, she\u2019s the one that pointed out the heavy plastic roll fell off the radiator. So I zoomed into the roll and you can see it open a little right before it gets knocked off(??). \nThoughts..? \nI went and tried to blow the roll off one day to try and disprove it, but it didn\u2019t budge. I moved it to different spots on the radiator and tried to blow it off, still no movement. \nThe prior owner said there was a little girl ghost named Polly who would \u201cget upset\u201d if there was noise after 9pm.

I was over at a friend's house, we had a good amount of people to play with their ouija board, maybe 5 or so people? (I want to preface this by mentioning the board we were using was used before to \"summon\" the well known ouija demon known as Zozo, by the person who owned the board. They supposedly \"sold their soul to Zozo for the demon to protect them from their biggest fear, which was being in a car crash\" or something similar to do with cars in that way?)  \nAnyways, we started playing. We circled the board with the planchette to warm the board up, and began asking questions. It began to answer, responding yes to if there was a spirit with us, and answering basic questions such as it's name, how old it was and why it died, which it gave answers to (i believe the first spirit had answered \"hospital\"). The group I was playing with began to ask dumb and all too playful questions and not taking it seriously, even making fun of me when I chastised them for not being serious about it, so I stopped playing with them after a while.I remember their non-serious nature went on for a while, but as they continued to ask questions, they all had gone silent and had seemed to become entranced by the board, deeply focusing and having a very very long session with it. I had tuned out mostly at this point, hanging out with my other friend on the couch who had also not opted into the session.This wasn't that I wasn't interested in playing, I just had no tolerance for the group not taking the game seriously, as I've always experienced paranormal shit since I was a baby in every single one of my households I had lived in prior, and was really sensitive to the paranormal.\nThis was my first experience with the board, before I was followed by something.\nI asked to borrow the ouija board, and my friend gave me permission. This marks the next time I played the board, which (this is going to be very dumb and cliche), but the day was Friday the 13th, and I decided on playing in Cal Anderson park in Capitol Hill in Seattle, WA. My friend and I took the board to the park, and I managed to find a few strangers to play with (my next mistake).We sat down and circled the board, I took to asking the questions. The spirit I managed to contact began to give me random letters, as opposed to the previous session having clear English written out. I asked if this was Latin, as I knew if the board began speaking Latin, you're supposed to end the session. It answered yes, then I asked if it was a negative spirit, it answered yes. Then I (my NEXT mistake) ASKED IT PERMISSION if I could end the session. It told me no... then began to circle the board in wide circles. I got really uncomfortable, and tried to push the planchette to goodbye, and a strong force pushed against the planchette, not allowing me to pull it to goodbye. I did manage to push it to goodbye after some more force, and told the spirit it was not allowed to contact me again. I cut contact with the session, and flipped the board, believing the session was cut off, but left with a deep feeling of dread in my stomach, like something wasn't right. And that feeling was correct,\nMy ex and I kept the board at his house in his shed for some time after that, because when we kept it in his house, strange things would happen such as footsteps, doors closing and opening, knocks underneath the floor, his doorknob wiggling, and other happenings.We returned the board to the original owner after this, the one who had summoned Zozo with it, we didn't want it around anymore and the owner had wanted it back.\nAfter all of this, a spirit followed me home. I would hear footsteps running up and down my stairs outside of my bedroom, I would wake up freezing cold with a deep feeling of dread and a figure at the foot of my bed, one night there was heavy banging noises in the garage, which my parents blamed on me, to which I frantically responded \"see? something isn't right, something did follow me home from the ouija board\", they began believing me more that night after the banging. I was so scared during this time that I sprinkled salt around my entire bed and doorframe, smudged with white sage (before I knew it was closed practice), slept with crosses and a bible on my bedside table and prayed to God every night. I became extremely spiritual around this time because I honestly had no idea what else to do or where to turn. I just wanted the haunting to stop.\nOne morning, my ex and I heard my mom knock on my bedroom door and ask us \"why are you guys sleeping still?\" and he got aggravated at my mom waking us up so early, I checked the time and it was 7am, which is really unlike my mom to be wondering why we were still sleeping at that time. When I went upstairs, a bit annoyed, to ask her about it, she was on facetime with my sister's kids in the living room, and had no idea what I was talking about (my mom isn't the type to prank me like that or lie, and she was really busy with the facetime call at the time it happened) I honestly think back and wonder if whatever asked us why we were sleeping was mimicking my mom or was an entirely different woman's voice and we had just chalked it up to being my mom since thats the only lady in the house. The thought still makes me sick honestly.\nThe person who owned the board who summoned demons with it was also extremely troubled, and ended up committing suicide a year or 2 after I stopped being friends with them.\nI haven't touched a ouija board since, and the experience left me with some trauma. I still sleep with the lights on. I still did continue use with my pendulums, tarot cards, practiced with gems, and scrying. But I never touched a board again, and I never will. The concept interests me still, and the fact I did have such a profound experience I'm not sure if I'm morbidly lucky to have had, I'm just glad that thing that had followed me home stopped contact after some time.", "media": null, "score": 38, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "comment_count": 5, "over_18": false}, "42": {"id": "19460qk", "locked": false, "subreddit": "threekings", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Assistance_Salty", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1705126844.952699, "created_utc": 1704991299.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/threekings/comments/19460qk/soul_travel/", "title": "Soul Travel", "permalink": "/r/threekings/comments/19460qk/soul_travel/", "selftext": "Is there a way to change your DNA via Soul Travel/ charkras,let\u2019s say you get Cancer or something and doctors can\u2019t do shit about it, is there a way to change DNA and Survive?", "media": null, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "comment_count": 2, "over_18": false}, "43": {"id": "18zu7b9", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ghosts", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Fullsend667", "link_flair_text": "WDYT?

So when I was about 4 or 5 years old, I woke up in the middle of the night while sleeping in my parents room. At the foot of the bed I saw this man who I didn\u2019t know walk into the room and look around at everyone who was in the room. He looked kind of transparent, and I could still see the color of his clothes and even his skin tone. After a few seconds of him looking around he just turned around and walked into the closet, I got up and tried to follow him but he was just gone. \nA week or so later my family went to a funeral and only then did I recognize the man. I didn\u2019t tell any of my family until years later and they only sorta believe me because of the recent event with my other uncle. \nSo anyways fast forward to last Tuesday and I had just gotten off the closing shift at my job. Me and my brother who share a room with our uncle was just kind of chilling the rest of the night, and our uncle had been out for the whole day basically. So we didn\u2019t know when he was coming home, finally I saw him walk inside from the back patio as he closed the sliding door and locked it. I only knew it was him because of the tattoos on him and the white tank top he would always wear. The rest of the night wasn\u2019t anything out of the ordinary, my uncle would walk around the room and the house and I even remember seeing him walk into the kitchen to grab something to eat.\nFinally I was getting ready to go to sleep at around 2:30 and I remember looking around the room and seeing my uncle lay in his bed. I also remember looking at my brother on his iPad with max brightness and thinking to myself \u201che should turn down the brightness or he\u2019ll bother uncle\u201d. It wasn\u2019t until the next morning when I got woken up with a knock at the door, and it was the detectives and my uncle\u2019s parole officer. They spoke with my grandma and told her my uncle was in the hospital, I didn\u2019t think too much of it because he had went to the hospital a week prior for stomach issues.\nAn hour later I got a call from my sister crying saying my uncle had been hit by a car and was brain dead. For the rest of the day I thought that this had to have happened sometime after 3 in the morning. Later that night we found out that it had happened around 9:30, while I was at work and before I even got home.\nI don\u2019t really know what to think of it.

So I started remembering only small parts since 7 and kept remembering bits and pieces throughout my life. I am gonna go out and say it this memory I have is of the otherside. \nThere I was in a void I could not see anything I did not have a sense of cold or heat or emotions like anger cuz I did not have a body. I was there floating at the great speed toying and playing around since I realized that I was an orb of light. So I was floating there happy I guess in every direction just messing around like a child. \nThe other glimpse of my memory is that of me waiting in line like in queue like on airport waiting for checkin type queue and it was a white I guess everything was white and there were other orbs like me. \nThe other memory I have is choosing my life idk what lead me to want to experience life but I really did not wanna miss out since everybody was doing it and it was kinda like fomo. So anyway choosing phase there were beings with me male energy and female energy? male to my right and female to my left? I was presented with thousands of different planets,worlds to live in like literally there so many I could choose from and it was presented like a in a screen. In those I saw futuristic city like metropolis type and feeling I get from that world was that it was very advanced civilization and the other screen I saw a reptilian humanoid being in a cave or rather he just got out of the cave to view the landscape I guess it was night and dark blue rocky area/world? It was overwhelming to choose just one life and I did sense that there was a pressure to hurry up? So I was kinda recommended by beings/guides/entities to go to the planet earth. So then I was to decide which of the family and year I wanted to incarnate to and what life I was gonna have. There were maybe three/four options to choose from? So anyway I was kinda interested or rather considering to choose options but I was again recommended to choose one family over other or rather I guess I wanted to at least incarnate in country city that was most advanced??? I saw glimpses of what that life would be like and I saw that I would get to experience life in other countries. I saw what my body would look like. So anyway the advantages of this life would be to get to experience life in other countries and this life would be much more relaxed in comparison to other options I was considering but there was gonna be a suffering internally. Life after 20s I guess was gonna be struggle? And I saw I would get to live till my 80s-90s? I only saw like moments/glimpses of the life I am living now. From the point of my orb self I was excited for this life I would say naive and I knew that this was not gonna be easy but it was the easiest from the other options. I also remember telling them that I wanna remember  and there were now three beings discussing this and I could not perceive them or did not know what they were saying??? Were there always three or is it because I did not notice the third one idk and the male one to my right did not communicate much it was like professional like he was doing his job but female one to my left was loving/caring? I also sensed other orbs too they were like me choosing I guess. I should also mention that choosing part was happening in darkness/void area. \nThe next memory after that is of me floating over planet earth and I felt like there was a pressure behind me to hurry up and through some device or pool or tube thing I entered or rather was sucked magnetically like sucked and instantly the first feeling I got was fear and I was shot like a bullet to earth at great speed I said to myself to remember this memory I willed it that I wanna remember and there as I was being bulleted to earth like zooming at the speed of light. From my perspective I wanted to stop and explore the earth as floating orb but I could not control the force. As I was approaching to the destination I decided I was gonna research everything about this planet and feel this freedom again. Then there was white light or rather a flash signifying that I already entered the womb and boom darkness again but now it was so warm and occasionally I felt that I was being fed that was strange since I as me me I do not need anything such as food/water/air and after there was another memory of just everything being blue?? \nOther memory begins of me slowly shifting from third perspective of me perceiving my body to the first perspective. I was excited and ran to the mirror to see as I looked I realized that it was not me and I was in a body? I surprised that I could move my hands for the first time. So there you go this is my memory from the other side.", "media": null, "score": 36, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "comment_count": 11, "over_18": false}, "68": {"id": "1928xlq", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ghosts", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Hopeful_Pay9339", "link_flair_text": "Personal Encounter ", "time": 1705126878.7945278, "created_utc": 1704784563.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/1928xlq/ghost_experience_in_hotel_turned_me_into_a/", "title": "Ghost Experience in Hotel turned me into a believer", "permalink": "/r/Ghosts/comments/1928xlq/ghost_experience_in_hotel_turned_me_into_a/", "selftext": "So this is an experience I had in 2018, when I was a Management Trainee with an organisation and it entailed a short one or two week stint across their major offices in different cities. Our office organised for accommodation for us too. \nFor my 2nd stint, I was put in a city where I had never been before and had no friends or acquaintances. So, the company booked a hotel close to the office premises. \nThe room was rather big and seemed quite luxurious, albeit a bit old and shabby. What stumped me the most was how economical it was. The first night was uneventful and for a woman, travelling alone for the first time, it felt secure & comfortable. \nThe 2nd night, at about 9.30 pm, I ordered in and after finishing my dinner, I went out of my door to place the food trolley for collection by the staff. Just when I turned around to close my door, I saw someone staring at me from the corner of my eye. The person was at the end of the corridor and it was very dimly lit. Let me add here, that only 2 out of the 20 rooms on the floor were occupied and 10 were being renovated. Hence, the dim lighting at night. When, I turned to look, the person ran out of view towards the elevator. I was creeped out & locked the room and reported this to the reception. \n3rd night- I was talking to my Mum on a video call and heard heavy pacing and running at about 10 or 10.30 pm. My mumma heard it too. I sneaked to the peephole and saw no one. But I heard the footsteps right outside my door. Called the reception & they sent someone to check, who reported that there was no one and I checked their CCTV footage. No one was there. \n4th night- I got a call on the Hotel Intercom and when I answered, I heard only heavy breathing and low growling noises. This continued another 2 times before I called the reception again to raise a complaint. They checked their call panel records and said I had not received calls from any current hotel guest or staff lines. I checked again next morning just to be sure and they showed how the system is automated and no one can tamper with it. It showed no incoming or outgoing calls from my room. \n5th Night- Heard a constant knocking on the wall behind the bed and it moved across the room, basis where I was standing. This creeped me out much more and as someone diagnosed with Hyper-anxiety & Depression, it felt like I was losing my mind and I got an anxiety attack. \nI ran out of my room to the reception, 2 floors below & the Manager on duty calmed me down and I was extremely upset. I questioned everyone around and none of the staff said anything and said it was strange such things were happening. \nLater, a woman from my hometown, who was currently employed there, accompanied me to a new room they assigned me to. She told me in private that The floor I was on was sealed for 5 years and had recently been opened. Rumour has it that some old hotel staff had molested a woman and she was killed in the struggle. The administration covered it up and paid off the perpetrator and family of the victim and sold this property to the current owners. Since then, people have reported multiple occurrences on that floor. \nAlso, these were major events. Some other small things happened like the feeling of being watched constantly, cold spots and feelings of nausea and panic. \nI checked out promptly the next morning and got another hotel, paid from my pocket and have since then, been extremely scared & anxious to be alone in any hotel room.", "media": null, "score": 214, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "comment_count": 59, "over_18": false}, "69": {"id": "194wtl8", "locked": false, "subreddit": "glitchinthematrix", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "RyzRx", "link_flair_text": "Glitch Vid", "time": 1705126879.5422053, "created_utc": 1705070973.0, "url": "https://i.imgur.com/QWTOicS.gifv", "title": "Day & Night Divider", "permalink": "/r/GlitchInTheMatrix/comments/194wtl8/day_night_divider/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 23, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comment_count": 1, "over_18": false}}}
