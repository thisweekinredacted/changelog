They soon realized that this man was not their neighbor and was a part of a group of non-human entities. The former having a head described similar to a hawk and the others were bald with square, black eyes and light yellow skin. After the jogging humanoids dissapeared, a ghostly apparition of what looked like a woman appeared with the smell of sulfur. She had no face and parts of her body kept appearing and disappearing and once even walked througha wall. She raised her hand and pointed towards the UFO the boys sighted earlier and walked away once a police car began to drive towards her. The boys panicked and ran back to their house and called the police.

Excuse my writing because I'm not a writer. \nTo begin with, my dad is native american and spent a lot of his childhood and early adulthood. \nThe first one-- my dad was walking around in the woods of a reservation with his friends. His friends were back at the car, he was walking about 50 feet away from them. \nHe saw another native man behind a bush but he could immediately feel something was wrong with him. The guy had on no clothing as far as he could see, no jewelery or makeup or anything distinguishing. His hair was pulled back into a ponytail.\nThey held eye contact for a long time, what felt like hours, was in reality probably less than a minute and a half. He was temporarily frozen with fear. He called for his friends but none came, he turned to face them. Then he looked back and the man was gone. Within seconds, noiselessly, no sign there was anyone there at all. \nThe second was is definitely a lot closer to what most people think of when they hear about skin walkers. My dad was out in an secluded forest when he heard a piercing scream very close by. He described it as a mix of a native throat cry, the ayayayaya sound sort of sound mixed with that of a feral cat or hurt bird. They brushed it off this first time. \nThen, they heard it a second time. It was just as close as it had been then despite them moving. They decided to get out of there.

It all started around one in the morning when Luisa saw a bright white discoid object in the sky. The observation continued until 2:00 a.m. when the three decided to go to bed. After about an hour, Lisa woke up with the distinct sensation of feeling an annoying presence in the room: a freezing cold filled the entire room, making her teeth chatter. He opened his eyes and saw a greenish, fluctuating light that filled the entire room: a few steps from the bed was the blurred silhouette of a monstrous, semi-transparent human figure. He had very thick arms and legs, his height was around two meters; the being extended two large, chubby hands towards the girl as if to grab her. It looked huge, although it had no features, it was like \"shaven.\" Luisa felt she was being observed by a horrible gaze. The being touched the face of the witness with her hands, who screamed at the top of her lungs, thus waking up her mother, who however, upon seeing the being, fell backwards. to bed passed out. At that moment the \"figure\" began to retreat towards the window, shrinking until it was reduced to a small green dot (like that of old televisions when they were turned off). Meanwhile, Roberto, awakened by the screams, also ran towards the room, being able to see the green dot and noticing the low temperature present in the room. It must be said that after 2 months the family was again the subject of \"visits\".

During a picnic, Maestro Federico was preparing lunch, when he suddenly noticed a strange figure standing behind some nearby bushes. He described the figure as short, with a strong build. Only the area from the waist up was visible. On his head he wore a gray metallic helmet, similar to those worn by \"Roman soldiers.\" On the helmet were a series of spike-like metal protrusions, about 4 centimeters long. Where the eyes would have been, there were 2 round holes, no nose or mouth could be seen. The helmet was connected to a gray jumpsuit that looked like an asbestos suit. Another witness then arrived and tried to use a camera. At that moment the figure made a strange gesture with his hands, performing a peculiar \"writing\" movement with one hand on the palm of the other. The witness then felt dizzy and scared and was unable to take any photos. When he regained his composure the strange figure was no longer there. Moments later the witnesses heard a whistle coming from the sky. Looking up he saw a disk-shaped object disappearing at high speed to the northeast.

I only arrived in Thailand two days ago and it was an unfortunate as I almost got kidnapped on my first night. \nI went to Bangla road which is well known and had a few beers at a bar and then went to the popular club Illuzion. \nI was having a good time, dancing and meeting people. In the club I had only 3 drinks, tequila and orange juice. But at some point I realised I was a lot more drunk than expected. Do not know if I was spiked, but I was dumb and had my drink on the table next to me while I was dancing and it was very crowded. In total over the space of three hours I only had two beers + three tequilas. Usually that is an okay amount for me to be aware. \nI went to the bathroom and felt very intoxicated and threw up. Upon leaving the bathroom a guy who I do not know, grabbed my arm. He seemed young and I asked him what he was doing. He said he would help me down the stairs. After we got down to the road he dragged me down an alley and put me in his car. l was really scared at this point and didn't know how i'd gotten myself into a bad situation so quickly. I am very small and not very strong so it was easy for him to take control of me. \nHe started driving and I kept saying no, no, no and to stop but he said don't worry i'm taking you somewhere safe which was so scary. I had maps open and we were driving out of Patong. Finally after some time I started telling him I would throw up all over him and his car if he didn't pull over. This seemed to annoy him and he pulled over. The second he stopped the car  I got out and ran down the street. Luckily there was a moterbike taxi who asked if I needed a lift and I jumped on and told him where my hotel was. I could see the guy walking down the road after me as we sped away. \nMade it back to my hotel safely. Honestly after that I'm not going to any bars or clubs alone. I don't trust anyone, feeling very vunerable. At least it was a lesson that I need to be a lot more careful.

I got out of my car still on the phone, telling my husband yeah, kiddos have the flu, I'm picking up medicine at the CVS, etc.   \nIn a very pleasant voice, the man says to me \"Hey! I got a question for you, you know where Main Street is?\" I , assuming he is asking for directions or the location of something, tell him I do. I'm still holding my phone to my ear, it's in a bright pink case so I'm sure he could see it. Now, this man is standing directly in front of me. There is a pillar and a trash can behind him, around the corner is a propane cage and a Red Box against the store's wall. Getting past him would put me in arm's reach. Next, he asks for a ride there. To a homeless shelter. It's very cold outside and he doesn't want to freeze. I empathized with him but said I couldn't. I offered to buy him gloves and/or a blanket and to ask if an employee in the store could assist in finding him a ride. Sweet baby Jesus, this guy's face instantly changed to pure rage. Then right back to pleasant. \"Well, you know what happens to homeless people stuck outside... You're going to help me. It's right. Down. The. Street.\" I'm standing there unsure what to do. My husband is on the phone asking what's going on. I gently tell the man that I don't feel comfortable doing that and that I have the flu (I don't) and my husband is on the phone with me. \"I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE FLU.\" Now he's getting more angry and not moving away from my route into the store. I didn't want to turn my back on him to go back to my car which was several feet away in the dark. \nWhile this guy is glaring at me, I decide to quickly walk past him. I had my mask from the clinic in my jacket pocket so I pulled that out and held it in front of me while I moved towards the trash can. He looked disgusted but kept telling me I need to give him a ride. It's right down the street, he insisted. But I know where that street is and it's not as close as he says. He tried to guilt me and his words felt threatening but he didn't actually threaten me verbally. Once I was around the corner, I rushed into the store straight to the pharmacy. My husband said he's calling the police. He heard the way the man was talking to me and said to stay in the store. My knees were shaking. I'm not usually the type to be so afraid when confronted. When I got to the pharmacy, I interrupted the pharmacist and a customer, apologizing, then told them what happened. The pharmacist sent the store manager out (tall guy with a long beard, looked like he doesn't take crap from people). The police had already arrived. The man was told to leave... which he did momentarily. He came back inside the store yelling obscenities and something about me. Now the store manager has told him to gtfo, he's trespassing on the property. The cop came back to talk to me and told me she has arrested him many times. He's loud and likes to yell at people. But he isn't violent. The pharmacist had me hiding behind the screen where they give vaccines and left the half-door to the pharmacy cracked open in case I needed to get out of there. The cop had also told me this guy's first and last name, as did the store manager (is that normal?). The prescriptions are finally filled and I leave the store. The police parked next to my car to keep an eye on me. Oh, and the man refused a ride from the cop to the shelter.\nLater, I looked him up. His name is unique so he was easy to find online. Surprise surprise, he has a loooong record spanning three states and several counties. Tons of public intoxication charges, DWI, urinating in public... assault and battery and indecent exposure! I also looked up the homeless shelter. Yeah, as I thought, there isn't one where he wanted me to take him but that area is super sketchy. Earlier today I went to the corner store across from the CVS and told my friend, the overnight shift employee, what happened. She kicks him out of the store and calls the police every time she sees him because he yells at and threatens customers. But he always takes off before the police arrive. \n\u200b\nI know I could have handled that better. I was blindsided by his instant shift from pleasant to filled with rage. Big thank you to the pharmacy team who kept me safe and the store manager for confronting the creep. They didn't have to do all of that. I'm thankful my husband recognized I was in an unsafe situation over the phone. \n\u200b\nThis man is still out there somewhere in my area.", "media": null, "score": 157, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comment_count": 29, "over_18": true}, "55": {"id": "199vols", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ghosts", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Elliot_bug", "link_flair_text": "Personal Encounter ", "time": 1705733352.639138, "created_utc": 1705599353.0, "url": "https://v.redd.it/nqfsnx4ki8dc1", "title": "A video my sister took a couple years back", "permalink": "/r/Ghosts/comments/199vols/a_video_my_sister_took_a_couple_years_back/", "selftext": "Something runs past the doorway, looks like it could be a small kid by its size but idk, ( I commented some pictures of that doorway showing that no human could have ran that fast in such a little space) ", "media": {"reddit_video": {"bitrate_kbps": 800, "fallback_url": "https://v.redd.it/nqfsnx4ki8dc1/DASH_360.mp4?source=fallback", "has_audio": true, "height": 640, "width": 360, "scrubber_media_url": "https://v.redd.it/nqfsnx4ki8dc1/DASH_96.mp4", "dash_url": "https://v.redd.it/nqfsnx4ki8dc1/DASHPlaylist.mpd?a=1708325352%2CMzJhZWRlYTBlYzI1NzdmNjNiNzJlMmNhZDUzNGE5ZmFmNGFjYTM5MzExNzg3NTQ3OTc2NTIxMDVhNTBmNGQ0Ng%3D%3D&v=1&f=sd", "duration": 2, "hls_url": "https://v.redd.it/nqfsnx4ki8dc1/HLSPlaylist.m3u8?a=1708325352%2CYWVlMzE2OGQ2MWQwNGNhNjhmYWQwZjAzZWYyNjUyZDI2ZmViMmNiZDQ0MTgzNGQyNWU4OGFjYTZiZDAyZWJhMg%3D%3D&v=1&f=sd", "is_gif": false, "transcoding_status": "completed"}}, "score": 472, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "comment_count": 250, "over_18": false}, "56": {"id": "1999p1q", "locked": false, "subreddit": "glitchinthematrix", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "LastTarakian", "link_flair_text": "Glitch Pic", "time": 1705733352.8305528, "created_utc": 1705530313.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/s3rihjb9t2dc1.jpeg", "title": "This carrot in my bag of carrots from the store.

He grew up with his many many sibling being passed around through homes and orphanages. He would usually tell me a lot of funny stories because I was still young before he passed. But one story was different and I didn\u2019t remember it until just now, when I found out that this sub existed. I have no proof other than my word.\nOne night, when he was ten or so, he\u2019d gone to bed at one of the orphanages he once stayed at. It was really late at night and he was having a hard time sleeping. But when he did fall asleep he had weird dreams where he made it sound like he was having an out of body experience. He was seeing himself sleeping in his bed that night like he was in the body of another person entirely. He described it like he was standing over himself, so I have to assume he was much taller. Then it all ends because he wakes up and opens his eyes. He said standing over him surrounding his bed (only the back end was touching the wall) were five or so really tall dark people. Dark as in shadowy. He couldn\u2019t see their faces at all. He said he didn\u2019t feel scared, and that he closed his eyes again. Then he said he fell asleep again and woke up in the morning. \nThat was how he ended the story. No pay off. He never told the story to me again and he\u2019s been dead for a long time so there\u2019s no way to find out anything else. Based on vague memories of how he ended up telling me the story, I believe he was trying to say they were aliens. As a kid I remember saying \u201cthat\u2019s awful\u201d at the end, because I think at the time I thought he was implying they had hurt him in a bad way. But looking back I don\u2019t think he meant it as a scary story. He was very quiet after. \nMy step-grandfather was great. He was a father figure for me and I think I just wanted to share his story to honor him. I miss him a lot, and I do want to take his word for it here.
