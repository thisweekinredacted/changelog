I waited a few more nights before I decided to post to see if this was some reoccurring, explainable thing. It hasn't happened since so I feel it's appropriate to post.\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I were going to bed around 10 or 11PM. Our bedroom is in the basement and our room mate lives upstairs. His schedule is the opposite of ours, so we have become accustomed to him knocking on our door later in the night if he needs anything.\nFianc\u00e9 and I were having our final conversation before drifting off and we hear a familiar knock at the door. \"Come in,\" I say because we're all pretty close and he knows he's welcome. No one steps through the door and I say again, \"come in!\" Still nothing so we call his name and, when he doesn't come in the door, I get up and open it. There was no one there.\n\"Huh,\" I sat and we joke briefly about how it's \"the ghost\" (long story short, we've had some other weird experiences, as people often do with an old house, but nothing as weird as what happened this night) and go to bed.\nFianc\u00e9 falls asleep and I start to drift off. As I'm falling asleep, another knock. This doesn't wake fiance up so I don't say anything and instead get up and decide to investigate the basement a little. Maybe the cat is being a brat, or something is settling. I note that the knocking sounded similar in tempo to the first time it happened so I wondered if it was some pipes in the walls adjusting to the winter temperatures. I figure, yeah it must be that, but I couldn't help the feeling that the noise was very obviously knocking against our door. We are very used to the sound as our our roommate very often approaches us that way. I also know what creaking pipes sound like and this was not that, nor had the pipes ever adjusted that way in previous winters.\nWell, whatever. It's annoying but no big deal. I go back to bed and actually fall asleep this time. About 30 minutes later, the knocking starts again. *Knock-knock-knock,* it could be something settling in the house but it so obviously sounds like knuckles on the wood of our door. The pattern, the tempo, and the hollow sound of our door. And it IS happening at our door. It's not in the walls or the ceiling. We have our laundry room a room away from our bedroom but our door is so thick that we NEVER hear anything happening out there. It is decidedly weird but I'm tired and have to work in the morning so I try my best to ignore it.\nEVERY 30 minutes to an hour, the knocking comes back and with each occurrence, the knock pattern changes. Deliberate *knock-knocks,* fast *knockknockknockknockknocks,\" there was even a *shave-and-a-haircut.* Each time I'm trying to ignore it and fall back asleep, only to be jostled awake again.\nI had lost track time but I assume it was early morning when I was SHOT awake by a knock followed by a male voice saying, \"Hey!\"\nOkay, so this HAD to have been our roommate. I got up and once again opened to door to find no one. Well, maybe he was messing with us. He has a weird sense of humor. I begrudgingly put on some clothes to go walk around upstairs and find him. Turns out, he's still at work. The house is pitch black and I'm starting to freak out. I go to the front door and see if someone was knocking there and there's no one. Of course if there was someone trying to get in all night, the dog would have been freaking the fuck out, but I really had no other explanation.\nSo, I make myself go back to bed. Maybe the pipes are not only shifting to sound like knocking on wood, but also creaking to sound like a man calling out. The night goes on and, though the knocking continues, I finally get used to it and actually get a few hours sleep...\nUntil around 7AM when my fianc\u00e9 and I LEAP out of bed to another obvious \"Hey!\" From outside the room. One last time, I open the door to find no one. I confirm with her that yes, she woke up because of the \"hey\" and I explain to her that I've been dealing with the knocking all night.\nRoommate doesn't come home until later in the day and I ask him if he tried to talk to us the previous night. He confirms that never came home and stayed at a friend's house. I tell him what happened and he's as stumped as we are.\nLike I said at the top, we waited the following nights to see if there would be any more weird house sounds and, even as things have warmed up and cooled down again, there have been no more weird noises to suggest pipes or other old house sounds.\nIn general, we're fans of paranormal activity stuff but I always err on skepticism. This was probably the weirdest things to happen to us at this house and I still don't know what it could have been if not some genuine high strangeness.", "media": null, "score": 97, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comment_count": 33, "over_18": false}, "12": {"id": "1gtypjj", "locked": false, "subreddit": "letsnotmeet", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "harlequinns", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1732331118.062233, "created_utc": 1731911705.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1gtypjj/my_new_friend_turned_out_to_be_a_cult_leader/", "title": "my \"new friend\" turned out to be a cult leader", "permalink": "/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1gtypjj/my_new_friend_turned_out_to_be_a_cult_leader/", "selftext": "PSA: Oh my god there have been TWO new incidents since my original post. I've had to edit this bitch twice. Receipts at the end.\n_\ntdlr; I thought I was meeting a group of likeminded women and instead, I just watched a cult take advantage of vulnerable people\nSo, this started on one of those \"meet new friends\" apps.\nI'm not just a huge loser, I swear. I moved to my current city during the pandemic and have a work from home position, so it just hasn't been the prime circumstances for a social life.\nI matched with this random girl, we'll call her Annie. I can't remember if I saw her first or vice versa. Honestly, I was paying more attention to the profiles than the pictures, and she seemed okay. Spirituality came up somehow. I can't remember how this happened either, and to be fair, it could have been either of us. I've recently been more seriously following norse paganism, but it wasn't something I was seeking to explore with other people. It's mostly a private thing, not to mention my own beliefs are more metaphorical.\nBut that doesn't mean I'm closed to the experience entirely. So when she mentioned having a \"LGBTQ neurodivergent pagan femme\" coven, I was like... okay wow, that's either very specific or very broad. But hey, why not? Maybe it'll be fun. So we agreed to meet first before I went to the event.\nONE weird thing that stuck out in our text conversation was that her partner was in some \"bizarre Scientology rehab\". At first, I assumed this was a place where one recovers from Scientology lmfAO. But I DID ask her if her partner was a Scientologist. I didn't get an answer.\nWe only met for an hour to have coffee. I think more red flags would have popped up if we'd had more time, because the little things that went off on my radar were things that weren't... THAT weird. Like there were explanations, or I decided to give her the benefit of the doubt, and my dumbass didn't ask again about the Scientology thing. I kept MEANING to google Scientology rehab, but kept... forgetting to do it. I've since googled it and can't find anything about a rehabilitation for ex-Scientologists soooooo I wish I'd done that sooner.\nThere were, however, OTHER things that stuck out. They're relatively benign out of context, but putting everything together in retrospect made me feel dumb:\n- She wouldn't answer any direct questions about herself. And not for lack of asking. I'm the kind of person who is conscious of when the attention is ALL on me, so it made me uncomfortable, and I didn't... learn anything about her, really. Most of what she said had to do with her spiritual \"awakening.\"\n- Her spiritual awakening itself sounded weird asf. She said she had a realization that she was like a lighthouse that was drawing people toward their personal enlightenment. And okay, I DID think this was weird, but like? She's from California, idk. Maybe that's normal. I just chalked it up to her personal beliefs being whatever they were.\n- Reincarnation came up. Reincarnation is a big part of paganism, although Asatru additionally focuses on your ancestors. She told me she didn't think she had any past lives and is a \"new\" soul, which doesn't make a lot of sense, but okay. Whatever. Not my circus, not my monkeys. The vaguely supernatural element she placed on herself was strange, but I know a lot of people want to feel special. That didn't mean I had to believe it.\n- At one point, I told her about this random woman I met at the pagan festival who tried to con me. She wanted to charge me so I could be \"under her wing\" or whatever, lmfao. I don't need someone to protect or guide me, so I declined. As I was telling this story, I could tell Annie was conflicted. Like she wanted to agree, but didn't. Finally she said something blas\u00e9, like how it was only inappropriate because the student should CHOOSE the teacher. So I clarified that I did not want a teacher.\n- Her responses were very mirroring. And I'm not a moron. I was getting a weird sense that she wasn't being honest with me, that she was telling me things that I wanted to hear, and told myself she was probably just nervous. I have a strong personality. I'm very independent, so I can understand if someone wouldn't want to go up against the things I said at our very first meeting.\nI know I'm just dumb at this point, but I didn't want to be paranoid. I don't trust people easily and I KNOW that, so I was trying to loosen up and be more chill.\nYeah, big mistake.\nSo, I go to this thing.\nIMMEDIATELY it's weird, ya'll. IMMEDIATELY. The second I step foot in that house, I'm uncomfortable. It's filled with people and completely silent. Everyone is looking at me. I'm laughing and saying hi, and no one is like... really responding, lmfao, and here I am awkwardly dropping my keys AND phone while everyone is just watching me.\nEventually I take a seat on this short couch, because there's no room in the large circle. It's a very small living room and there are like 20 people circled up. There's a cushion on the couch, so I sit on that. The \"leader\" starts talking, and as she's going on, I'm looking around at the people there. I was curious. Out of the corner of my eye, I see the leader TRYING to look at me. The girl sitting in front of me is partially blocking our view of each other, so the leader is like... leaning over to try and meet my gaze. Finally I felt awkward enough to like, shift over, so that I was leaning against the arm of the couch.\nStaying perched on a fuckin cushion was UNCOMFORTABLE by that point, so I shifted off and spread out a bit to be more comfortable. The leader ended the speech with, \"so spread out, I GUESS,\" which was clearly directed at me. It was said with some humor though, so I... wasn't sure what to make of it.\nEveryone introduces themselves and is their own unique brand of neurodivergent. I'm ADHD, but I guess I don't subscribe to labels beyond the requirement to stay medicated. I've been medicated since 2015, so this isn't a new diagnosis for me. That was the ONLY question we got asked about ourselves, beyond our name.\nThe leader guides us through this meditation, and people are making these weird breathing sounds and hums. I get it. It's spiritual, right? UNFORTUNATELY, my ADHD ass can't focus to save my life, and it's impossible for me to follow the guided meditation. I do not understand. HOW can anyone with actual attention issues listen past trills and deep nose breathing?\nSo I'm sitting there with my eyes closed and BARELY paying attention. Because I can't. But I DO hear the leader say that we should think of anything we'd want to ask her, or need from her, and THAT got my attention. Wtf did I need to ask her? Other than where the snacks were. Because I paid 8$ and don't see a single snack.\nOnce the meditation ended, Annie and the leader walked around to give us material for an activity. Annie gave me two long pieces of twine and the leader gave me two sticks. As the leader was handing me the sticks, I asked her where the snacks were.\nShe was like \"in the kitchen. On the table. Where snacks tend to be.\"\nI'm a dry, sarcastic person, so I thought it was her brand of humor. I laughed and played along all, \"oh right, I think I'll find them!\"\nLiterally she was deadpan, unsmiling. \"Mm-hm.\" And then walked away.\nSo stupid me thought she might just be like that, but then I saw her laughing with the other girls, and realized something was off. As the activity commenced, she went back over to Amy and started stroking her back, kissing her hair, and giving me this creepy smile. YEAH. IT WAS WEIRD. I was so uncomfortable, I wanted to get up and go. But I couldn't.\nWhy? Because of this damn activity.\nThe activity was the last straw. They wanted us to think of something we wanted to discard that brought us pain. Then they wanted us to FEEL how bad that thing made us feel, as we slowly twisted the piece of twine around the stick. That's shit I would only ever do with my therapist. Obviously, people were emotionally melting down before long.\nI wasn't comfortable doing the activity for obvious reasons. So I sat there awkwardly with the sticks and the string in my lap. I was the only one NOT doing it, and it was obvious. But because I wasn't doing it, I had the opportunity to watch Annie and the leader, and it was chilling.\nAnnie was doing some weird pyramid thing above her head with her arms. There were a lot of references to her as being a lighthouse, or some sort of guiding figure throughout the meeting. She was the ONLY one who wasn't doing the ritual, other than the other leader. They were both running it. Suddenly, it occurred to me (as it probably did to ya'll already) that Annie had been using this app JUST to bring people into their group. She was the only person who seemed to know EVERYONE, yet no one there knew each other. Even the name of the group now made sense - they weren't being *specific*, they were casting a wide net. And I had this big realization in a handful of seconds. It made my stomach turn.\nSo yeah. I was done. But I couldn't get up, because people were sharing their experiences and shit, pouring their hearts out. This was the most fucked up part of it, imo. There's no reason to do a releasing ceremony that forces people to feel their trauma. Especially at the VERY FIRST MEETING. It's also inherently manipulative, because it requires people to let their guard down. Then they can \"save the day\" by showing people how to release the very same pain THEY just inflicted.\nBut that isn't the fault of the people there, so I didn't want to disrespect them. Like, people were sobbing on top of my shoes I left by the door. I had to wait for the best time to ask someone to pass them to me. Finally I got up and told everyone I had to go to the car, then took off.\nI texted Annie and told her I wouldn't be back and that I hoped she found \"her people\", lmfao. Just make sure you're not her people. Be REALLY careful of any spiritual ceremony or practice that demands vulnerability from you, especially directed by people who don't know you beyond a name.\nAnnie, let's not, under any circumstances, ever EVER meet. Again.\nAnd if ya'll ever hear the term \"neurodivinity\", run. If ADHD made me divine then I'd be on my 94th incarnation by now.\n_\nEDIT: Ya\u2019ll there\u2019s been an update. The girl who ran it texted me and I have the receipts. Don't worry, she's got ThEm CeRtiFiCaTiOns!!! It's also EXTRA hilarious that she accuses me of projecting my trauma and insists that's why I took issue with her method. THEN she had the audacity to APOLOGIZE for the imaginary trauma she assumes I have. ALso... I don't know why she thinks I actually did the exercise, because I left behind the twine and sticks untouched. I did not participate or even try to think of a trauma to release.\nBecause to be honest, although there's some trauma in my past, I'm not haunted by it, and have worked through a lot of it with a licensed therapist. The ad hominem attacks were just silly to me.\n_\nEDIT EDIT: oh my GOd I am shaking this time. Ya'll. I went back on the app bc I had new matches and messages. One of them seemed normal at first, we were talking about video games, and she asked me about zelda. Zelda is my name on a lot of social media. People typically assume it's about the video game, but I'm actually weirdly obsessed with Zelda Fitzgerald lmfao I'm a lit nerd ok. Anyway, she said \"I would love to get together and hear more about what Zelda means to you.\"\nOkay seriously, who talks like that? I'll give you two guesses, but you're only going to need one. So I looked at her profile. 0 mention of spirituality. Finally I ask, dreading the answer, and she is part of Annie's group.\nWhat's particularly hilarious was how vehemently the leader denied getting her members from that app, and yet, the VERY NEXT PERSON I ENCOUNTER ON THE APP is in her group.\nI swear, ya'll. I swear. I am getting off this fucking app. I am deleting it off my phone. I'm getting an entirely new phone. I'm changing my number. I'm going to space.\nFuck new friends.", "media": null, "score": 467, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comment_count": 57, "over_18": true}, "13": {"id": "1gwimgy", "locked": false, "subreddit": "truecreepy", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "HamletX95", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1732331118.1856143, "created_utc": 1732204826.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/y6al8y362a2e1.jpeg", "title": "In 2006, a 70-year-old fire lookout disappeared from her isolated post near Hinton, Alberta, leaving behind only a smear of blood on the porch of her cabin.

For those who dare invoke its rites, prepare to be bound in perpetuity to the inky blackness that precedes the dawn of time, doomed to a tormented existence besieged by nightmares and visions potent enough to fracture the strongest of wills.\nOrigins: In the dim recesses of time, when Earth lay unformed and the heavens but a canvas devoid of stars, there thrived beings of immense power and malevolence, beings that even the gods hesitated to name. Foremost among these was a presence known simply as \"The Mouth.\" Legends whisper that The Mouth was the nascent echo of creation, a voice rising from the void to speak of all that was and all that could never be. This entity, older than the cosmos itself, holds knowledge so profound and so harrowing that it taints all who dare to perceive it.\nIt is told that King Solomon, in his insatiable thirst for wisdom, once summoned The Mouth. From their encounter, he penned a chapter of the Goetia so accursed that all copies were believed destroyed. Yet, whispers persist of a sole surviving manuscript, the Liber Obscurum, which is rumored to contain the true rite of The Mouth along with other dark arts.\nPreparations:\n\nEncase the room with heavy, black drapes to banish all light, mimicking the eternal abyss.\nA Candle of Midnight Black: To be lit only briefly, serving as a beacon to the shadows.\n\nA Boundary of Salt and Charred Bone Dust: Blend these to create a barrier between the realms of mortals and the abyss.\n\n\nAn Heirloom Mirror: A relic, preferably, that has borne witness to the visages of the departed.\n\nA Silver Blade: To draw blood, a sacrifice essential to capture the attention of The Mouth.\nA Veil of Black Velvet: To shroud the mirror after the ritual, entrapping the essence of the entity.\nA Cup of Wormwood Tea: Brewed to be consumed post-ritual, emblematic of the bitter knowledge to be gained.\n\nThe Ritual:\nThe Summoning:\n\nInitiate at the stroke of midnight, the witching hour when the veil between realms is thinnest.\nIgnite the candle and position it before the mirror. Encircle yourself with the salt and bone dust.\nWith the silver blade, incise your palm, letting your blood seep onto the surface of the mirror while chanting:\n\"From the void, I summon thee, The Mouth that speaks from beyond the sea of stars. Speak, and let your words unfold the cosmos before me.\"\n\n\n\nThe Revelation:\n\nExtinguish the candle, plunging the room back into darkness. Gaze into the mirror, allowing your eyes to adapt until shadows begin to dance within the glass.\nA voice will emerge, not through your ears but within your mind, speaking in the primordial tongue of creation. Its message, though arcane, will imbue you with a terror and understanding beyond words.\n\nThe Binding:\n\nDrape the mirror with the black velvet, sealing The Mouth's presence within. Recite the binding oath:\n\"By blood and bone, I bind thee to this silent throne. Speak no more but through the dreams of lore.\" \n\n\n\nThe Closing:\n\nCast the remaining salt and bone dust over the cloth-covered mirror, ensuring it is thoroughly concealed.\nConsume the wormwood tea, embracing the bitter truth you now possess.\n\nAftermath:\n\nYou shall be afflicted by relentless nightmares, each a vision of potential realities and cosmic truths too formidable for mortal comprehension.\nShadows will cling more closely to you, and whispers will tease the fringes of your awareness\u2014The Mouth still imparting its accursed wisdom.\nMirrors will spontaneously fog, a sign that The Mouth continues to observe.\n\nCautions:\n\nNever perform this ritual more than once, for each summons deepens the entwining curse.\nThe insights gained will forever set you apart from your fellow man, isolating you within your cursed existence.\nGuard against sharing this knowledge; to do so is to propagate the curse, dooming others to the fate you now endure.\n\nIn your quest for the forbidden, you have tethered yourself to an eternal darkness, one that will forever overshadow the light of your days.", "media": null, "score": 11, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comment_count": 2, "over_18": false}, "15": {"id": "1gx260e", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ghosts", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Lowyy_hatake_99", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1732331118.7735758, "created_utc": 1732259380.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gx260e", "title": "photo of a real ghost (Little Girl in a church)", "permalink": "/r/Ghosts/comments/1gx260e/photo_of_a_real_ghost_little_girl_in_a_church/", "selftext": "Hello everyone, I wanted to leave you with one of the clearest ghost photographs ever taken.

On one hand it\u2018s been nice to read all the comments and input on what I could do to further investigate. On the other hand it has been terrifying to revisit this encounter in such detail and to carve away at the mystery of what I\u2018ve seen for the first time basically ever. My excitement quickly turned to fear of what I might find and talking to the owners only deepened my worry.\nI had pretty much dismissed the idea of talking to the owners of the field in my head. I had convinced myself that I didn\u2018t want to come off as weird by asking them six years after the fact and I also convinced myself that nothing would come off it anyway. I think I was honestly just afraid that they might not be able to give me what I wanted to hear which is that what I\u2018d seen was nothing more than a scarecrow of sorts. Holding back on asking them is what kind of kept that possibility a reality in my mind and gave me some comfort in knowing it could\u2018ve been a scarecrow, so I didn\u2018t want to rob myself of that comfort by talking to them to potentially find out it wasn\u2019t. Well it wasn\u2019t.\nI took these last week to really think about how I want to continue with this and I thought about what they told me 24/7. I\u2018ve been as afraid and as paranoid as I\u2018ve ever been since my encounter and I\u2018m not sure if I want to continue looking into this. I tried to stop thinking about it and distracting myself but what they\u2019ve told me is keeping me awake and keeping me from functioning normally these last days. I even have doubts about sharing what they told me and I have not idea if I\u2018m just reading way too much into this. But I took a chance on asking them so now I\u2018m gonna take a chance on telling you guys what they said.\nI told them what I saw and tried to leave out as much of the weird details as possible so as to not come off as crazy. I basically asked them if they ever had a weird looking silver Scarecrow or machine in one of their fields. They were very VERY interested to find out more about what I\u2018d seen. Apparently around the time right after my encounter, so April of 2018, they had to stop using the field for their horses because the horses repeatedly got sick from grazing there and were acting weird and unusual in general. They said they had the field looked at by a an environment examiner. They didn\u2019t hear back for a while until they were informed that the land had been contaminated but didn\u2018t receive a detailed explanation of what happened. They told me it was very hard to get a concrete answer on what happened to their field and that they received an offer to buy their field by some sort of environmental protection organization a couple of months after the official examination. They told them that the field would most likely never be safe for usage again and that they wanted to make further examinations of the ground. Apparently it was a very good offer which made it possible for the owners to move on from all the losses they endured due to the sick horses and new space they had to rent for them to graze, so they took it.\nThey told me that they\u2019ve never heard back about the field and that they could never get any information when they tried to talk to someone. They have also never seen anyone other than that first examiner look at the field. I showed them the pictures I took (see my second post) and they said that they know nothing of fires or anything similar which could\u2018ve caused the ground to look like it looks and they were very surprised because they thought no one was active at the field but from my pictures it looks like there is. That would also explain the weird smells but I\u2019ve also never seen anyone in that area other than farmers and other dog walkers or people going for walks. The stress of the whole situation made them to just want to be done with it but they were still very interested in what I\u2018d seen and the pictures I took and they pretty much asked me more question than I asked them.\nWhen they told me their horses got sick I got extremely worried about my dogs since they were biting at some of the surrounding grass but both are fine at this time and I\u2018ve never seen any sort of signs that warned people of contaminated grass or something. So either the area is not contaminated anymore, it never was contaminated or me and my dogs got very lucky.\nStill, I\u2018m extremely paranoid that I did something very stupid. I wish I never talked to them and I just hope I didn\u2018t give them any ideas. I\u2018m scared that they tell the people who bought the field about what I\u2018ve seen (if they don\u2018t already know). I don\u2018t want them to get in trouble and I\u2018m scared for my safety. I\u2018m very paranoid. Looking back now the way I acted was so stupid and naive.

I\u2019m someone who\u2019s always been somewhat cautious, so I was alert, keeping an eye out for any unusual activity.\nAs I walked down the street, I noticed a guy about 20 feet behind me. At first, I didn\u2019t think much of it\u2014he seemed like just another person walking the same route\u2014but something about his movements caught my attention. He wasn\u2019t walking in a normal manner. He was clearly trying to keep his distance, but his pace matched mine, no matter how fast or slow I went.\nAfter a few blocks, I decided to take a detour. I turned onto a side street that was a little less populated, hoping he wouldn\u2019t follow. I checked over my shoulder, and sure enough, he was still there. It\u2019s hard to describe, but I felt the hair on the back of my neck stand up. My instincts told me something wasn\u2019t right.\nI crossed the street, hoping that would throw him off. But he crossed too, without hesitation. I thought, \u201cOkay, this is weird now.\u201d I had to make a decision. I wasn\u2019t that far from home, but something about this guy\u2019s persistence made me uncomfortable. I decided to stop at a nearby 24/7 convenience store to try to lose him.\nThe store was empty, save for the cashier, who barely looked up from their phone. I quickly grabbed a drink and stood by the door, hoping to see if the guy would pass by. He didn\u2019t. He stopped right outside the store. At this point, I could see his face clearly through the glass. He was staring directly at me.\nI panicked and ran back into the aisles, trying to calm down. I could hear his footsteps growing louder as he approached the door. I couldn\u2019t stay here any longer. I tried to pay, but I was so rattled I couldn\u2019t focus on anything. The cashier just stared at me, probably wondering why I looked so frantic. I threw the drink on the counter, paid quickly, and bolted out the door.\nI ran down another street, not wanting to look back but knowing I had to. I didn\u2019t see him for a while, and my heart slowly started to calm down. But as I turned the corner to my street, I saw him again, standing at the far end of the block. It was like he had been waiting there the whole time.\nI wasn\u2019t sure what to do next. I considered calling the police, but he hadn\u2019t really done anything illegal, just followed me for a while. I didn\u2019t want to overreact. But I also couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that this wasn\u2019t a coincidence. He was still standing there, watching me, and now he was closer. I took a deep breath, checked both ways, and made a beeline for my apartment building, not daring to look back until I was inside.\nWhen I got to my apartment, I locked the door and stayed there, staring out the window for what felt like hours. I didn\u2019t see him again after that night, but the whole experience left me unsettled for weeks. I never felt comfortable walking home alone late at night after that, even though I\u2019ve lived in the city my entire life.\nI still wonder if I was just being paranoid, but there was something off about the way he followed me. It felt intentional, and it left me with a gut feeling I couldn\u2019t shake.\nIf you're reading this, the guy who followed me for hours that night\u2014let\u2019s not meet again.", "media": null, "score": 201, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comment_count": 14, "over_18": true}, "29": {"id": "1gt5bed", "locked": false, "subreddit": "threekings", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "FranceCance", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1732331128.0370245, "created_utc": 1731816556.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/threekings/comments/1gt5bed/have_you_ever_had_anything_happen_by_reading_the/", "title": "Have you ever had anything happen by reading the rituals?", "permalink": "/r/threekings/comments/1gt5bed/have_you_ever_had_anything_happen_by_reading_the/", "selftext": "Hello, FranceCance here.

Most probably it happened n 2008 or 2009. I was friends with a fellow student at the time, we used to meet frequently, both at the university and back at the dormitories were we lived. We also went to the same fencing club together. One summer we used to meet a lot at the top of the tall dormitory building where he lived, which was located in Sogn student town. The building had a lot of floors, I seem to remember it had 10, so it was taller than most of the other dormitory houses sprawled around it. My friend lived in the top floor. There was a quite small balcony at one end of the top floor, where it was possible to get some fresh air. The floor itself was quite deserted the times I were there, I rarely saw anyone else, and we had the balcony for ourselves. We used to grill out there, drink wine and smoke a hookah he had, and in general had a great time together. \nOne late evening I remember we got back into the shared student kitchen after having been sitting out on the balcony for quite some time. It was pitch black outside. At one end of the kitchen, there was a row of large windows, looking out in the dark night. I believe we may have been talking about mysterious topics, but I am not sure. We sat at a kitchen table by the row of windows, all alone, facing each other across the table. Outside the window, and fastened above it, there was hanging a power cable to the ground far below. Suddenly, I noticed in the corner of my eye that there was a dark figure hanging below the cable, crawling up it. My friend noticed it too, staring in fear and being so frightened that he fell of his chair. I instinctively pushed away from the window myself in the same instant. The \u2018vision\u2019 lasted only a second or two. We both talked about it, and found out that we had seen the same figure crawling up the cable. If anyone of you have seen the movie \u00abAliens\u00bb, the sequel to the horror classic \u00abAlien\u00bb, you might remember a scene where the characters are hiding in a kind of control room at the space colony. They are very anxious, as the electronic detectors indicate many aliens are closing in on them, but they cannot understand how. Then one of them opens one of the ceiling plates above them and takes a look inside. He sees the aliens hanging upside down and crawling forward inside this narrow space. The crawling movement of the figure I saw, was exactly the same. At the time, I dismissed it as a shared illusion or hallucination. We were surely scared, but I left the place soon afterwards. I do remember me and my friend talking about the experience later, several times, but I did not attach any importance to it. It was merely a curiosity. \nHowever, many years later (in 2021 or 2022), I shared the experience with another friend. And he immediately said: \u00abCheck if somebody has fell from the building\u00bb. The thought had never entered my mind, but I promptly searched in Google for this. And, lo and behold, it came up right away. Several news articles came up, describing how one student had fell out of a building at Sogn student town and died. It happened during a party. The police had researched it, but found no evidence of anything criminal. This occurred in 2006, a few years prior. I immediately contacted the old student friend whom I had seen the figure with, sharing the news articles, and asking about his opinion. And he said he knew of the case. It was a foreign exchange student from Russia who had fallen out of the same building he had lived in. My friend said he had fallen out from the floor below where we sat, if he remembered correctly. There had actually been rumours for a long time afterwards about sightings of his ghost in the area.\nSo what I originally had regarded as just a trick of the mind, became all these years later something much more eerie. Was it really a ghost? I don't know, and I never will. I certainly had never heard about the death of the student at the time the experience occurred, so it cannot just be my mind imagining things based on my expectations of something paranormal occurring. If anyone has experienced something similar, please share. This experience has at least led me to consider other peoples weird experiences with an open mind.

I have some crazy stories where I have been genuinely scared for my life, but this has got to be the worst. \nI\u2019m working a double at the restaurant. Around 11 am a delivery man comes in with a package that I had to sign for. He comes, I sign for the package, and tell him to have a good day with a smile. I continue my shift per usual. This was a Friday or Saturday, I can\u2019t remember specifically, but later on we got BUSY. The restaurant and parking lot full. I see a lot of different people daily, plus seeing someone (for the 2nd time ever) out of their uniform, you may not recognize them. FedEx driver comes and sits at the bar. I don\u2019t (obviously) remember him from the 25 second interaction we had that morning. I start talking to him as I do all my customers. I get him a drink, appetizer, another drink, entree, etc. Our conversation started\u2026\nHim: \u201chow long have you worked here?\u201d \nMe: \u201ca few years, I\u2019ve worked my way up\u201d \nHim: \u201chow do you like it here?\u201d\nJust regular conversation with a bar guest. It slowly became\u2026. Not so regular. He asked me if I had a boyfriend, I said yes. He would change the subject and then go back. Complimenting me saying how beautiful I was ever few minutes. \n\u201cCan I have you number?\u201d \n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think my boyfriend would appreciate that.\u201d \n\u201cOkay What\u2019s your last name, we could just be Facebook friends?\u201d All annoying, but normal interactions I have had with men in this industry. \nHe started to become really pushy over time. Pressing for my phone number or social media. I continued to politely decline and laugh it off. \nHe then tells me\u2026 \u201cI actually came this morning to drop off a package with fedex. You signed for it??? I came back just for you..\u201d\nI smile, and continue with my stupid customer service \u201coh yeah, I remember you!\u201d Smile and laugh it off. \nI even stepped in the back to vent to my manager at this point, about how he was being extra pushy and uncomfortable. \nFlash forward about an hour, he pays his tab and leaves. I\u2019m just glad he\u2019s gone at this point. \nWe\u2019ll say as a guess, it\u2019s about 7 pm when he leaves. We are still busy, and we close at 10. \nWe finish dinner service, customers slowly start to leave, and the restaurant is finally empty. Ive been cleaning for a while, and am finally finishing up. It\u2019s about 10:30 at this point. I\u2019m cleaning the bar, I look up, (the whole front of the restaurant that im facing consists of large windows that face the parking lot) and I see one (1) car in the parking lot, I notice that the delivery driver/ guest from earlier, is standing outside of the car, walking around it and seeming like he is cleaning the backseat out. Doors open, and he is leaning in and out with a bag. As soon as I realized it was him, who had \u201cleft\u201d almost 4 hours ago, my heart sank. Why was he still here?? Why was he cleaning the back seat out?? I freak. My manager and I are the only people left in the restaurant at this point. It\u2019s almost 11. I run to her and tell her everything. About how he came back \u201cjust for me\u201d and about how he had seemingly left 4 HOURS ago, and I made her come from the back of the restaurant to behind the bar up front so she could see him in the parking lot\u2026 idk, WAITING for me???? \nShe says she\u2019s gonna call the police. At this point my boyfriend and I had an apartment literally 5 minutes away from the restaurant. I told her not to worry about it, I\u2019ll just call my boyfriend to come get me. \nI did just that, but my bf could immediately tell something was wrong, and when I\u2019m scared/ anxious, I ramble\u2026. So I gave him a quick debriefing of what was going on. He said he would be there soon and I hung up. My manager made me sit in the office until he got there, so I didn\u2019t see this go down. \nAll I remember is my boyfriend coming into the restaurant to get me, walking me to the car through the back door, and me getting home. \nMy boyfriend, who is very confrontational and protective, later tells me, that he pulled in the parking lot to see fedex driver sitting in the drivers seat of his car. My bf walked up to his car and knocked on the window for him to roll it down. He does, and my boyfriend tells him something along the lines of \u201c you need to get out of here\u201d this is where the scariest thing happens.. the dude responded to him in a different language, mumbling and acting like he didn\u2019t speak English!! My boyfriend said something like \u201cI know you speak English, you\u2019ve been talking to my girlfriend all night, and you need to get out of here\u201d dude continued to ramble in a different language, until my boyfriend raised his voice and basically said, you have 15 seconds before I pull you out of this car and you never leave this parking lot, for the guy to finally, put the car in drive and speed off. \nI was on edge for weeks after this interaction and even considered switching jobs. \nWhy was he still in the parking lot that long after close and hours after cashing out his tab, and WHY was he cleaning his back seat???? \nTo the creepy bar guest/delivery driver, let\u2019s never meet again.

I know that memory can be tricky, but I have also thought about this experience every day since it happened. It\u2019s less important to me if this experience was real or not, and more important to me that whatever it was - it had a significant, long-lasting impact on my life. \nAnd the crazy thing is, it lasted just a few seconds. \nIt was the night before or early morning of January 25th, 1999. Central California. And I only know the exact date because it was the only time it snowed here (in a really long time anyway) so you can still Google the newspaper articles about it. \nAnyway - basically, I woke up, like sat up straight in bed\u2026and crouching on the bed (one knee bent on the bed, one leg off the bed) was a typical gray alien. Large head, big black eyes. To me the skin looked greenish-gray and had an almost rubbery or just very smooth texture. No nose, slit for a mouth, no visible ears. Remember it not wearing any clothing. \nIt just stared at me and I just remember feeling shocked\u2026like not enough time to even feel terrified (that came the days, weeks, months after). For whatever reason I just laid backed down, turned on my side, put the covers over my head, and I guess I fell asleep. \nThe whole next day I was thankfully partially distracted by a rare snow day, but I also was very aware that I would not be able to go to sleep without feeling petrified for a long time. I thought about telling my parents, but I didn\u2019t have a word for what I had seen. No reference for it. Didn\u2019t know it was an \u201calien\u201d or a \u201cgray.\u201d For lack of a better word, it was totally alien and unknown to me. \nIt wasn\u2019t until I was at a friends house whose dad was watching a sci fi movie that had typical grays in it, that I learned to associate what I had seen with the word alien, and that they were at least \u201creal\u201d enough to be depicted on tv. And then of course, I noticed them everywhere - in shows, movies, art, etc. \nI accept that this could have been a hallucination or very vivid nightmare or whatever\u2026maybe I had seen them depicted on tv before and my subconscious picked up on it\u2026but it is the single event that led to a lifelong obsession with aliens and unexplained phenomena. Sometimes I wonder if that was the whole point of that experience in the first place or if that\u2019s a part of the reason why they appear to people - just so stories about them will continue to influence our culture, mythos, spirituality, etc. \nAnyway, thanks for reading!

One evening he went hunting alone in the bush. In an isolated area he suddenly felt something coming from behind him. He turned around and saw something in the sky, which at first he thought was a helicopter. He assumed it was performing an emergency landing and ran towards the scene to possibly render assistance to the pilots. As he approached the location he realized that the object was so bright that he had to shield his eyes from the glare. When he got even closer he saw something that shocked him. The object was not a helicopter, but clearly a UFO which in the distance seemed to have a diameter of fiver meters but which in reality was much larger, possibly 50 meters. Its shape as described by Mr. X was round and on one side of the device black smoke and fire spewed out. When it landed a tripod like landing gear came out.\nConfused, he still wanted to offer his help. Meanwhile a metal ladder dropped down from the top of the object and five men got out. They wore some kind of blue diving suit that shone so brightly that it stung the witness\u2019 eyes. The men wore helmets made of a glass like material that had some kind of shiny metal cover on top, from which a tube came out and connected to the mouth and forehead. Two other hoses ran behind and were connected by two metallic devices on the back of the entities. The men also seemed to have several rope like devices hanging on their backs.\nWhen the entities got down from the ship, X walked up to them. He added that one of them was carrying a strange instrument in his hand. He then made a sign to the, the peace sign used by Natives. This made theme recoil, apparently startled. The leader then spoke to the others in a quick foreign and high-pitched sounding language. According to X. outwardly the entities resembled humans. The one that seemed to be the leader turned to X and spoke to him in a melodious Spanish and told him that they were from the planet called \u2018TIOS\u2019, which us earth people knew as Jupiter. Then he scratched the witness\u2019s back, and this gesture was repeated by the other four. At this point, the witness felt sedated, his head was spinning and he was unable to speak. At the same time the leader kept speaking to the witness and wondered how they could have come across a man similar to themselves. He claimed that they were here to help earthlings, and to obtain substances that were indispensable to them. The leader then invited X to inspect their craft. He then allowed himself to be lifted on board. At this moment he was seized with panic, and felt like an \u2018ant\u2019 in their presence. The craft was brightly lit inside by an unknown light source. Inside, X saw hundreds of appliances and indecipherable feeder boards, monitors, etc. The leader told him that the craft was powered by some form of electricity. He was taken to a room which resembled a laboratory which contained large maps on a wall. There he saw about 15 other men who were apparently \u2018scientists.\u2019 He was then taken to the \u2018engineering hall\u2019 and there he saw what appeared to be large \u2018smoking\u2019 turbines that were linked by cables. There was also equipment similar to transformers. The witness was soon escorted off the ship and the entities and ship left, but not before promising a return visit.\nHe was taken to a room which resembled a laboratory which contained large maps on a wall.

He became very ill after this encounter and finally had to admit himself in a hospital in Lisbon. The doctors could not come up with a satisfactory diagnosis as to what was causing X\u2019s illness. He died in 1973, and according to his nephew during the autopsy it was discovered that his organs had turned green. X never discussed the incident with anyone, except for his family.\nSource: UFO Information 1981 # 1 citing Jose Garrido in \u2018UFO Nachrichten\u2019 nr. 245, June 1977.", "media": null, "score": 74, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comment_count": 12, "over_18": false}, "68": {"id": "1gxcvpa", "locked": false, "subreddit": "cryptids", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "CryptidKing04", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1732331156.628163, "created_utc": 1732295613.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/r6yorix8kh2e1.jpeg", "title": "Never forget that Teddy Roosevelt was going to hunt the Snallygaster ", "permalink": "/r/cryptids/comments/1gxcvpa/never_forget_that_teddy_roosevelt_was_going_to/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 169, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comment_count": 10, "over_18": false}, "69": {"id": "1gu96ii", "locked": false, "subreddit": "thetruthishere", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Bulky_Western357", "link_flair_text": "Unidentified?", "time": 1732331156.9405432, "created_utc": 1731948442.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1gu96ii/weird_yellow_cream_ish_colored_humanoid_in_forest/", "title": "Weird yellow cream ish colored humanoid in forest ", "permalink": "/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1gu96ii/weird_yellow_cream_ish_colored_humanoid_in_forest/", "selftext": "A few years ago, I saw something weird in Cumming Ga, in someone\u2019s backyard by a small creek. It was around 4\u20135 PM during the fall, and everything was calm and quiet, with some birds in the background. I was with a few friends and my brother at the time.\nWe noticed this figure, and it stood out because of how strange it looked. It was cream-colored or off-white and didn\u2019t have any facial features at all. The head looked football-shaped, not exactly a football, more like an elongated oval, and the rest of the figure seemed pretty human-like in shape mixed with alien. It was around the same height or maybe a little taller than a normal person, and it had a slim build \u2014 not fat, but not muscular either.\nAt first, it was just standing there, staring at some sticks it had in its hand. After a while, it looked up and stared at us. It didn\u2019t move or make any sound, just stood there watching us. We ended up running away after that. I wasn\u2019t really scared at the time cuz I was like 7 or 8. The area around us was completely still, with no breeze or movement in the trees. It felt too quiet. The stillness added to the weirdness of the whole experience.\nAbout a year or two later, I went back to that area with just a friend and my brother, and I saw it again, only this time it was closer, maybe about 150 feet away. It was still staring at us, just standing there and not doing anything else. It didn\u2019t approach us fast but it slowly slowly hovered towards us, i definitely knew it was aware of us. After that, I never saw it again.\nI was wondering if anyone has seen anything like this before, or if you might know what it could be.
