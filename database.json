On the night before New Year's, we had a terrifying encounter with something horrible. It was 1.30 AM, and we had stayed at the house all day, ate pizza, watched movies and played Mortal Kombat. We had also been to the sauna and had all been in good spirits as later that day it would be New Year's. We were outside my friend's house, which overlooks a very small valley, about 10m in depth and 60m in length and we were blowing up some firecrackers that we had prepared ( his house is quite isolated with the nearest neighbours about 100m away. We blew them up one by one by throwing them into the valley that was next to the house. As we were doing this, I was the first to notice a black silhouette with a glowing cigarette in the distance moving towards us extremely fast. I immediately notified everyone with me and told them to get inside the house's courtyard. My friends saw the figure, were confused as to who it may be and what they were doing but weren't worried, as the figure was a very long way away, and we had at least 2 minutes before he came close enough to properly see our faces or do anything. I looked back at the figure and immediately noticed that his eyes had a faint glow, nothing crazy or bright, just a very faint, yellow/goldish glow, similar to the way a cat's eyes reflect light in the darkness. I also noticed that the figure had travelled a very large distance in the 5 seconds I took to turn around and inform my friends, this was especially worrying as he was walking, not running. I immediately knew that it was time to leave, I ran towards the gate to the house and yelled for my friends to follow me, which after witnessing what I had witnessed, they obliged, except one of them. One of our friends looked frozen in fear, his eyes were wide open, his mouth slightly open too and he was not blinking. This entire time he was looking at the figure. I ran and pushed him in order to get him to move, which made him snap out of some sort of light trance, as he was slightly lost.  By this point the figure was about 100m away, and nearly at the same time, all of us were filled by a visceral feeling of dread, not fear, but more like: 'Whatever is happening right now is very, very wrong', we later realised that this probably emanated from the man. As we were entering the garden and ducking behind the fence, we noticed that the man was moving a minimum of 5 times as fast as a regular person running, while making absolutely no noise, even though he was walking. We hid behind the fence for ages and managed to get a picture of him from underneath the fence. He then walked into the nearby woods, leaving behind absolutely no footprints and making no noise at all. I have no clue what this was but we are 100% that whatever this was was not human.\nUPDATE!!!: I forgot to add but one of my friends said that the man apparently turned into smoke at one point??

A couple of months ago, I was looking for extra work because my hours at my regular job were shit. I\u2019m quiet, anxious, and don\u2019t have any friends so I turned to Craigslist. I knew the site could be sketchy, but I was desperate for side gigs and I hadn\u2019t had any luck as someone with no skills and not whilling to do sex work.\nOne ad caught my attention. It offered $50 for someone to take photos of a property using either a camera or something above an iPhone 12 (I have an iPhone 14), promising it would only take an hour or two. I emailed the poster and soon got a text back. The man said I seemed like the perfect fit and invited me over that same day. What\u2019s funny is I actually made a post on r/toafraidtoask about if it was a dumb idea, which everyone told me to take a person with me. I didn\u2019t and deleted the post shorty after.\nThe house was about 20 minutes outside of town, surrounded by dense forest. It was small and run-down, but nothing that raised alarms. The man who greeted me looked like he was in his 50s, unremarkable. He invited me inside. The house was completely empty\u2014no furniture, just dust and dirt.\nI asked where to start taking photos, but was dodging the question, making small talk and asking personal questions about me instead. My anxiety was building so I kept the small talk going, but then he began staring at me intensely. I dropped my phone at one point when we eventually started taking photos though the house, and when he picked it up, he held onto it a little too long before giving it back.\nUnprompted when taking photos of the master bedroom he brushed my face with his hand, complimented my skin. I knew it was stupid coming here but at that point my blood truly ran cold and I was done making excuses in my head. I made a quick excuse to leave, something about my mom, but when I turned toward the door, he grabbed my arm. I still have the picture I took after the ordeal of the bruises on my forearm. It felt like it was gonna get snapped in half. I had brought a small knife for self-defense, a gift from my paranoid mom who would have never let me come here if she had known. Without thinking, I pulled it out and stabbed him in the arm (it was released with the push of a small button. He let go, swinging at my arm with the knife  but I was already running out of the house. I got into my car and drove until I was at a gas station and my heart was calm. \nI called the police and explained everything. They took it seriously, I came in to make a report and answer questions. They searched the property and the surrounding forest but didn\u2019t find him. The house turned out to be abandoned, and in the basement, they found a pack of zip ties. A report was made, but he\u2019s still out there. I call sometimes for updates but it\u2019s never anything of substance. I\u2019ve never told anyone about this other than the police, not even my mom. I know typing this I sound pretty unbothered but that\u2019s the first time anything like that has ever happened to me and I have trouble leaving my house most days.

For me it's pocong. The pocong is a ghostly figure deeply rooted in Indonesian and Malaysian folklore. It is believed to represent the soul of a deceased person whose burial rites were improperly completed. According to Islamic tradition, the deceased is wrapped in a white shroud (kain kafan) for burial, and the cloth is tied at the head, feet, and around the body. The pocong emerges when the ties at the head or feet are not untied after burial, preventing the soul from resting peacefully.\nIn folklore, the pocong is said to rise from its grave, seeking help to have its burial ties undone or wandering as a restless spirit due to unresolved issues in life.\nCharacteristics of Pocong\n\nAppearance:\n\nThe pocong is wrapped entirely in a white burial shroud, with only its face exposed.\nIts face is pale, often decayed, resembling a corpse. Some depictions include hollow eyes or darkened, sunken features.\n\nMovement:\n\nDue to its tightly wrapped state, the pocong is often portrayed as hopping rather than walking.\nIn some stories, it floats instead of hopping, adding to its eerie presence.\n\nBehavior:\n\nThe pocong is not always malevolent. In many tales, it appears to seek closure or assistance.\nHowever, its sudden appearance and unsettling form are enough to instill fear in those who encounter it.\n\nSymbolism:\n\nThe pocong serves as a reminder of death and the importance of properly following burial rituals.\nIt also reflects cultural beliefs about the afterlife and the consequences of unfinished business or neglected spiritual duties.\nThe pocong has become a popular figure in Southeast Asian horror films, literature, and urban legends, symbolizing a blend of fear, tradition, and spiritual mystery.", "media": null, "score": 439, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "comment_count": 131, "over_18": false}, "16": {"id": "1i01n3b", "locked": false, "subreddit": "glitchinthematrix", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "coachlife", "link_flair_text": "Glitch Vid", "time": 1737168699.1352012, "created_utc": 1736728676.0, "url": "https://v.redd.it/lg9wyua0qnce1", "title": "What is this?", "permalink": "/r/GlitchInTheMatrix/comments/1i01n3b/what_is_this/", "selftext": "", "media": {"reddit_video": {"bitrate_kbps": 800, "fallback_url": "https://v.redd.it/lg9wyua0qnce1/DASH_360.mp4?source=fallback", "has_audio": true, "height": 358, "width": 640, "scrubber_media_url": "https://v.redd.it/lg9wyua0qnce1/DASH_96.mp4", "dash_url": "https://v.redd.it/lg9wyua0qnce1/DASHPlaylist.mpd?a=1739760699%2CYjMzY2ZjMWFhNTBlNzM4NTJkMmJlYTg1M2IwNGQxYTE3YTFhZDk4NTUyZDY0NmM4MDBkZjY5NTU5MDMwMzQ0ZA%3D%3D&v=1&f=sd", "duration": 15, "hls_url": "https://v.redd.it/lg9wyua0qnce1/HLSPlaylist.m3u8?a=1739760699%2CZDE3MGIyZjI3NmE3ZTc0ZDM5OWJhNWIxYmFhZjZjM2VlN2FjMDc1NDFhNWZkY2EyMTRiOWYyODQ0Mzg3OGViYw%3D%3D&v=1&f=sd", "is_gif": false, "transcoding_status": "completed"}}, "score": 1791, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "comment_count": 366, "over_18": false}, "17": {"id": "1hyzwj9", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ufo", "stickied": false, "category": "Aliens", "author": "2_Large_Regulahs", "link_flair_text": "Post Disclosure World", "time": 1737168700.8192918, "created_utc": 1736613812.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/8zy4i7vg8ece1.jpeg", "title": "Jimmy Carter promised to disclose \"every piece of information\" regarding UFOs if elected president.

He grew up in the country where it\u2019s mostly farms and and agriculture, houses are very far apart except for a few villages. this event would\u2019ve taken place sometime in the mid to late 80s, and as has been explained to me by both my parents, around this time there wasn\u2019t any phone lines, just streetlights and that\u2019s abt it. \nMy father started working around the age of 9, he would go down to villages or centers in order to sell or deliver vegetables as my grandparents grew vegetables like lettuce, tomato\u2019s, and more. He would very often stay out late as he would be required to deliver vegetables to several restaurants. One night as he was heading back, a herd of goats was obstructing the road, to put into perspective he uses a little carriage like the ones ice cream vendors tend to use in hispanic countries, so he couldn\u2019t just scoot by as his carriage was being blocked as well. Then from behind him, he heard a voice state \u201cCuanto para una lechuga, muchacho\u201d which translates to \u201cHow much for a lettuce young man\u201d. When my father turnt around, he says he saw a 10 foot tall man, who looked very skinny bordering on malnourished with pale skin, he couldn\u2019t completely see his face however he stated that from the little he could see his face was very sunken. The man was wearing overalls with a flannel shirt, a bandana on his neck and a straw hat, I know the description sounds very stereotypical however again, this does take place in the deep county, like an hour away from any city or town. According to my father the straw hat casted a shadow thus he couldn\u2019t see the man\u2019s eyes, however he could see his sunken cheeks and crooked teeth when he talked. My father was weirded out but due to how young he was(in his early teens, around 10-13), he just assumed it was a very tall man, instead of something paranormal or something he should be afraid of, thus my father said the price, the man paid and my father handed him a piece of lettuce which according to him, the man was able to hold with one hand comfortably. As the man walked away with the lettuce, according to my father, the man whistled and the goats followed the man. My father then just headed home. If he told my grandma, or anything like that I\u2019m not sure he didn\u2019t specify. \nAs said before this took place decades ago, and the area this took place was very isolated with no houses nearby. To explain the area better, a lot of Oil Palm trees are grown there thus there are areas where you won\u2019t see a house for a few miles and all you\u2019ll see are just huge banks of Oil Palm trees. As for how he knew he was 10 foot, it was just a guess however he state he was as tall as the ceiling of the house we were in when he told the story, and the ceiling was pretty high, at least 10 feet is my guess. I heard this story a few months ago however I just found out about this sub so decided to post it here since it intrigued me a lot. If you have any questions please don\u2019t be shy to ask, I have plenty of stories like these due to my family all growing up in the deep country, and plenty of relatives stating they\u2019ve seen weird things. How true are they? I\u2019m not sure however I\u2019ve been told them as if theyre fact so if you all wanna hear more i\u2019ll be happy to share.

I (31M) was on my way to the grocery store to buy some stuff I needed for apple cake. At one point as I'm walking I see a tractor up ahead that's removing snow. It has been warm for the past few days and most of the snow around had melted to the point where the roads and sidewalks were visible now. Oh well, maybe there's some big pile of snow elsewhere or something.\nThe tractor was blocking the sidewalk so I decided to wait for it to move out of the way. I stand there for about 2 or 3 minutes waiting and notice something odd: the tractor isn't picking up any snow. In fact, there is no snow for it to pick up. I get annoyed and walk around it to continue walking.\nAs soon as I cross the street at an intersection the tractor starts slowly following me. As in driving onto the sidewalk where, once again, there was absolutely no snow and following me. It moves slightly faster, not so fast that I have to run but enough that I need to pick up the pace a little bit. Due to the bright front lights on the tractor I can't see the driver, so I just keep walking. I assume the tractor is going to continue moving forward so, not wanting to inconvenience the driver, I crods the street again, walking past a closed caf\u00e9. The layout is such that it would be a bit difficult for any large vehicle to maneuver through it so I think I can continue my walk in peace.\nNope! The tractor continues to follow me, the driver giving zero Fs about the difficulty maneuvering. Getting slightly alarmed I quickly walk around the closed caf\u00e9 and into some backstreets, thinking I've lost them now. I keep walking and hear the tractor on the other side of the building I was passing. Somehow it had gotten there before me.\n\"You've got to be kidding me!\"\nThinking this person is stalking me, I try to run from one building behind another and just as I get to the building I pull my left calf muscle. In a bit of pain I limp through a gap between buildings too small for anything bigger than a grown person to get through, get behind the wall and take a moment to rest my leg and catch my breath. I can clearly hear the tractor and see the light of the moving from the gap I just came from. I sit there for 5 minutes listening to the tractor's engine run before it finally drives away. I wait a bit longer just in case before continuing on to the mall, still limping a bit but not as bad as before.\nI've been sitting here for about 20 minutes now typing this down and from inside the mall I can still see the tractor driving around. Idk if I'm imagining things, if this person is just some idiot who was bored and thought following me around would be funny or if they were up to something bad. All I know is I have a pulled calf muscle because of it.\nSo to the tractor driver, let's not meet again.", "media": null, "score": 76, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "comment_count": 11, "over_18": true}, "29": {"id": "1i33jyu", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ghosts", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "OhGodOhNo-", "link_flair_text": "Captured Apparition ", "time": 1737168709.7890387, "created_utc": 1737072989.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i33jyu", "title": "Picture I took back in 2020 inside my local church.

I always tell the story the same as it's burnt in my mind like it was yesterday. I lived on a Mesa in Safford Arizona ( a mesa is a raised plane of earth above the surrounding resembling a Table ) there were 4 other family's  that lived on the mesa our farm was a 40 acre piece of land with our nearest neighbors being 1/4 mile away. I was awoke and for lack of better term pulled to my bedroom window which faced the Graham mountains,which during the day I could see the road that went to the top of the mountain.\nthere where no home or building anywhere in that direction atleast not in 1978 . What I saw about 200 yards away was a classic silver ufo with the two halves that separated the craft a bar of puling light that went clockwise in direction and a ramp coming from a opening and at the bottom of the ramp were 3 aliens whom I could see clearly unclothed gray with very large eyes and very spindly arms short but upon seeing them at this distance I heard them inside my head and upon hearing them talking to eachother in incomprehensible language I realized I wasn't able to move any part of my body and this caused my heart to race and I guessed one of them noticed and to calm me down informed me I was being given a gift and to not worry I would be thankful for it . It was like my brain was a filing cabinet and they were rifling through it and I've always had the feeling   that they either left something or modified something as after going to sleep which I don't remember how that took place the following days had amazing things take place but I'll get to that later I awoke that morning and went to my friends house 1/4 mile away and told him about this experience and he said let's go to where you saw the ship we got there and where it had been was a brand new green plants on the otherwise lifeless or occasional creosote bush randomly strewn around, this was a solid bright green circle the size of the craft I'd seen.\nThe next night was the night before Christmas and after falling asleep I awoke floating out of my body in the lotus position the kind the yogis do and looked down at my sleeping body I was on auto pilot just along for the ride and this included going through my closed bedroom door didn't feel anything as you might expect saw everything that was under the tree but unwrapped still the stretch Armstrong the rock em sock em robots etc. went back floating about 3 feet above the ground again through the closed door and back into my sleeping body. Since that happened I know that it occurred but still believe the gift I was supposedly given isn't really a gift,  on occasion for no particular reason words will come out of my mouth about something in the very near future that will occur, on many occasions I've just said something to my wife like once while driving I said two of those 4 guys on the gold wings will be dead only an hour later  before going on the bridge to the first key in Florida we'd witness 2 of the 4 bikers weeping over the 2 dead bodies on the side of the highway and once out of many such similar occurrence I was benefited by hearing a  warning in my head and then physicaly pulled  backwards before a 6 zone 1 1/2 \" rotary valve that I was directly over particularly my head exploded and went 80 feet into the air and onto the next street , that would have killed me,  and many other similar things usually regarding people about to die in a motor vehicle accident .Some gift huh?  I do attribute them  to my experience that night I've never wrote in any of these groups but thought I'd share this one not sure why hope I made since I don't have much of a gift for writing.

The liquid was smooth and flawless, but every so often would turn chaotic and swirling in all directions before going perfect again.

I didn\u2019t usually like to go back home in between as naturally once I got settled in, the last thing I wanted to do was go back to work. So if it was nice, I\u2019d walk around downtown, sit and listen to music in the park, etc. If it wasn\u2019t, I would literally just get on the El to ride around and read or listen to music for a while.\nOne day, it\u2019s the latter scenario and I\u2019m riding what\u2019s a sparsely populated train as it was afternoon on a weekday. I\u2019m on the inside seat of two facing forward, and a guy who just boarded the train plops himself down next to me even though there are plenty of empty seats.\nThere was nothing particularly objectionable about him, just seemed like an average guy probably in his mid to late 20s. I was annoyed he chose to sit down next to me when there were other places to sit comfortably obviously, but before i have barely registered my annoyance he lets out one of those giant dad sneezes. Everyone in the car turned to look at him, which is probably good for what followed.\nHe had covered his mega sneeze with his hand and, to my disgust, he extended it to shake my hand and introduce himself! I did not accept the handshake but said hi and maybe gave him an awkward elbow bump. He seemed affronted by this, but continued to try and make conversation with me, loudly.\nHe quickly started asking personal questions like what I did for work, where I lived, where I grew up, how long I had been in the city, etc. Clearly he was trying to gauge both my na\u00efvet\u00e9 and my income, so I was vague at first and eventually just stopped answering altogether. He then gave me a sob story about how he was on hard times, and maybe I could spare him some money. I didn\u2019t really believe this as, despite the sneeze, he had nice clothes and was well-groomed.\nWhen I told him I had no cash on me, he said, \u201cwell I bet you got a 30 day transit pass, so you could give me that.\u201d Maybe I should\u2019ve just given it to him, but the 30 days had just started and I made next to nothing for living in Chicago. Like hell was I going to fork it over! So I decline, and he says \u201clisten, I wasn\u2019t going to tell you this, but I have a way of getting what I want.\u201d\nObviously I\u2019m getting scared now, but as I mentioned, he was talking loudly so the other people on the car were subtly paying attention without getting involved to this point. At the next stop, a bigger crowd was on the platform and I used the opportunity to get off and cross over to head back the other direction. The guy got up and made to follow me off, but some of the people who knew what was happening strategically got in his way and soon the crowd was boarding and he wasn\u2019t able to get off before the doors closed. Phew, that was close!\nBut wait, there\u2019s more! Fast forward several months later. I can\u2019t recall the scenario exactly, but I was eating dinner quickly by myself at a Qdoba nearby where I worked. I was either in between shifts again or done for the day and I needed a break from our food. I was facing out the windows to the sidewalk; back a bit, not at the ones directly against the window. I see a guy outside hassling someone he doesn\u2019t appear to know as I\u2019m sitting there eating my burrito. There\u2019s something familiar about him, but can\u2019t put my finger on it. Soon, he leaves the other person alone and he turns his head to look directly at me, and then I remembered it was the bully from the El all those months ago! He creepily smiles at me and, to my horror, walks into the restaurant.\nI\u2019m like, there\u2019s no way this guy remembers me when very clearly I\u2019m not his only target. I think, maybe that\u2019s not who it was or he saw someone else, but nope, he comes and stands right next to me. He says something along the lines of \u201cwell, well, well, that looks good. Remember me? I told you I have a way of getting what I want. Let me have that burrito.\u201d If I were a brat I would\u2019ve said, doesn\u2019t seem you\u2019re very good at it seeing as you didn\u2019t get anything off me or that guy outside, but I\u2019m more of a freeze response type. So I just ignore him, keep eating, and since there are other people in the restaurant, I gamble he won\u2019t make a scene. I started to get worried as he seemed to be trying to wait me out, but I am extremely stubborn when I put my mind to something and I was not going to leave that restaurant before him. I ate very slowly, got refills, got more napkins. He tried to pretend like we were friendly, trying to make casual conversation but I kept ignoring him. Finally, he got distracted by another mark outside but before he left, he said to me \u201cill see you again sometime\u201d. Once I was certain he was not lurking around, I waited for a crowd and fell in to make my way towards the El and home.\nThankfully, I never saw him again. I am certain his story about being homeless was not true. Even though months of cold weather had passed and we were well into winter when I saw him the second time, he was still nicely dressed and well-groomed. It kind of seemed like he had ditched that story anyway and was taking a more aggressive tact. It honestly didn\u2019t scare me as much as it flummoxed me. He reminded me not only of the song I titled my post after, but also Deebo from the movie Friday. Just an old school bully with no real motivation other than to intimidate people. And of course, what were the odds of running into him again in a different part of the city, and that he\u2019d remember me after all that time?\nIn retrospect though, I should\u2019ve been more scared. He wasn\u2019t just a run-of-the-mill common criminal on the streets of Chicago. Something was off. At the time though, my mental health was in a bad place and I was making minimum wage in an expensive city. It didn\u2019t seem unreasonable to me to risk life and limb for my transit pass or dinner. I got lucky. Yes, I made some calculated risks, but still. It wasn\u2019t worth it and I hope my kids wouldn\u2019t make the same call, or be in a position where they would.

He was shown an orb levitating above a podium and a \"gauntlet\" emitting holographic, hieroglyphic-looking text. This second object reportedly killed the person retrieving it. I have back-channeled with Navy contacts who say that while Wright Patterson reverse engineers the Air Force\u2019s most exotic retrieved technology, Crane does this for the Navy.\nRandy also STILL occasionally works contract jobs at Area51 and has seen \u201celectrogravitic\u201d antigravity triangle-shaped craft flying around the test site.\nRandy\u2019s credentials are beyond reproach: we have his DD214 as evidence of his service and his weapons training certificate from Crane proving he was stationed there. The implications of this interview cannot be overstated. Although in many ways (as he\u2019ll admit), it begets more questions than answers.

At first I assumed it just might be a high-tech drone as I knew there was a launch station very close by, but very quickly that assumption was fading as it just seemed to buzz around in no clear direction directly above me. \nI can\u2019t fully describe this feeling but somehow I knew \u201cit\u201d knew I was watching it. Once I gave it my full attention it flew towards the ocean where I had to sit up and stare above the water to continue watching. I remember the moon being at least half full and it was bright enough that I could clearly see the clouds, and see anyone on the beach that passed by, even though I was alone at this time. I watched what I can only describe as a distant star-like light, only slightly bigger than the brightest star in the sky, again buzz around quickly in a seemingly directionless way. But now it seemed to be showing off more and flying erratically. It would go in one direction super fast and then make a dead stop. I also noticed the clouds reacting to its flight and shifting and twisting with its movements in a DNA sort of shape ( this could have been the mushrooms but I\u2019m not sure, this was +2 hrs since the peak )\nNow this is where things got weird. This is the point of the story where my reality started to crack. The light was in the left side of the sky and out of nowhere it shoots across the sky, horizontally to the right at about 10x the speed it was moving before. As it reaches this small patch of clouds I watch it teleport 100 yards directly to its left, then the same distance to its right about 8-10 times as it\u2019s moving in the same direction. It does it in succession in a way that it looked like it was \u201cjumping\u201d from point to point and not flying. Again, it makes a dead stop directly after this. \nAt this point my jaw has dropped for the first time in my life. I was thinking \n\u201cdid I really just fucking see that\u201d\nAnd guess what, for good measure it does the same thing again. As if it heard me. It flies back to the left side of the sky shoots across and teleports again.  Now I\u2019m on my feet as my reality is breaking before my eyes and I\u2019m trying to make sense of what is happening. A man leaving the beach starts coming near me and I think perfect, maybe someone else is seeing what I\u2019m seeing. I get his attention which he seems extremely annoyed by and I immediately say \n\u201cAre you seeing that shit flying around up there?\u201d\nHis response\n\u201cYa cool huh\u201d\nAnd walks off the beach not even looking up from the ground as he says this. Okay great, so I\u2019m crazy and now I look crazy to this random dad is what I think to myself. I\u2019m not certain what happened to the light after this as I was pretty dumbfounded and my mind was just in wtf mode. I think it just took off up into space shortly after the interaction with the man. \nNow begins my humanoid encounter. Sorry for the long UFO recount but I believe the details to be important incase someone else can relate. I don\u2019t see anyone else nearby that could have seen the light so I start walking towards the water. On this beach there is a ridge about about 20 ft from the shoreline and there is a gradual decent to the water at about 5 ft. I\u2019m standing at the top of the ridge when I notice two figures coming from the left. They are directly in front of the shoreline and at first I thought it was just two people jogging next to each other. But as I\u2019m focusing my eyes on them I cannot seem to make out any body parts moving or definitive features. I don\u2019t see arms or legs moving. I don\u2019t see hair bouncing, I don\u2019t see sand being kicked up, nothing. I can make out the outlines of a torso and maybe legs but I\u2019m seeing right through them into the ocean as if they have that predator camo people have mentioned. They were the same size, shorter than average humans, moving in synchronicity with each other and seemed more like they were floating rather than walking or running, though they were moving at a jogging pace. I still thought that maybe it was just my eyes messing with me in the dark, but it really wasn\u2019t that dark, you know how it is on the beach. I start to walk closer as they pass in front of me, slowly incase they were just joggers as I didn\u2019t wanna freak people out just approaching them in the dark. But when I take a few steps forward they both pick up speed and go past me and out of sight within a few seconds. Again no perceivable movements or sounds. They just zoom away down the shoreline. \nLooking back it is interesting that I saw these entities immediately after seeing the light. I still even consider the possibility that it was military tech and the figures walking by were just cloaked people seeing who saw the test flight. But the fact that I was on mushrooms and felt a mental connection between us makes me think it was a spiritual or alien encounter. I swear it felt like it communicated a \u201chey watch this\u201d before blowing my mind with the teleportation. I also felt a \u201cpresence\u201d or just pure fear after seeing the figures. Enough to immediately leave in my car. \nPlease let me know if anyone has experienced or heard anything like this. I know the UFO sighting is common but I have never heard of anything like what proceeded afterwards.

At that time, we lived with my mom, grandmother, and grandfather in a three-room apartment on the 6th floor in Ukraine, in Kherson city , in a large neighborhood called Shumensky. Those were criminal times in all post-soviet countries(not much changed since though( , and I was raised very strictly from a young age not to trust strangers and never to open the door to anyone unfamiliar.\nOne day, someone knocked on our door during the day. At home, it was just my mom and me. My mom approached the door and asked, \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d A male voice replied, \u201cOpen up, this is the police. We need to ask you some questions.\u201d My mom first looked through the peephole and indeed saw two men in police uniforms standing at the door. Only after that did she open the door.\nMy mom asked them what the matter was and what had happened. In response, they started asking her who was currently at home and how many people were in the apartment. I came closer and saw them. They looked at me, and I got scared and ran into another room. At that moment, my mom sensed something was wrong and tried to close the door, but one of the men put his foot in the way and held the door with his hand, preventing her from closing it. My mom, now frightened, asked again what they wanted, but they just silently stared at her without answering. An eerie silence hung in the air.\nSuddenly, our neighbor opened her door. She lived on the same floor as us and was about to leave her apartment on an errand. The two \u201cpolicemen\u201d immediately changed their expressions, looked towards the neighbor, and she noticed them too. With a questioning look, she glanced at my mom. Then, suddenly, the two men ran down the stairs and out of the building.\nIt was terrifying, and we had no idea what they wanted, but one thing was clear\u2014they had likely bought the police uniforms somewhere, or stole it, and were certainly not real police officers. \nSo, fake policemen\u2019s, let\u2019s never ever meet again!!!", "media": null, "score": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "comment_count": 1, "over_18": true}, "54": {"id": "1i34mqo", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ghosts", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "GoodiesNGanja", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1737168731.7363298, "created_utc": 1737076155.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/1i34mqo/my_fiance_and_i_have_both_seen_a_gray_cat_in_our/", "title": "My fiance and I have both seen a gray cat in our new condo?

I\u2019d also like to add that my mom was (and still is remembered as) a good, sensible person.\nThis took place in the early to mid-70s, back when my mom was a young girl living on a remote ranch in Baja California, Mexico. She was the oldest of six sisters, and life on the ranch often meant waking up early to help out with chores. One of her tasks was occasionally waiting for the water delivery person to arrive.\nThe ranch was pretty isolated\u2014I\u2019ve visited it myself, and even today, it\u2019s still in the middle of nowhere. There\u2019s a highway that curves along the entrance to the property, but other than that, it\u2019s very desolate.\nOne early morning, while my mom and most (if not all) of her sisters were outside waiting for the water delivery, something strange happened. From a distance, my mom noticed a spot in the sky. At first, she didn\u2019t pay much attention to it, but it kept getting closer and closer. Eventually, it flew directly over them, and what they saw left them in shock.\nIt was a flying dinosaur.\nMy mom and her sisters could hardly believe what they were seeing. My mom recalls learning about dinosaurs in school around this time. She distinctly remembered her teachers explaining that dinosaurs had gone extinct millions of years ago, and in that moment, she thought to herself, They must\u2019ve lied, because I\u2019m looking at one right now.\nShe described it as a large creature with wings that flapped loudly as it flew over them. It made strange noises and had no teeth, which my mom found interesting because she\u2019d learned in school that carnivorous dinosaurs had sharp teeth for hunting.\nOnce the creature flew over them, my mom ran inside to get her nana (grandmother). Her nana was a kind, playful woman, but when my mom told her, \u201cNana, there\u2019s a dinosaur outside! Come look, fast!\u201d her grandmother thought she was joking. Still, she followed her outside and managed to catch a glimpse of it before it disappeared.\nA few weeks later, my mom\u2019s uncles were headed into town to buy groceries, and my mom asked one of them to bring her back a copy of her favorite magazine, Duda. For those who don\u2019t know, Duda: Lo Incre\u00edble es la Verdad was a popular Mexican magazine that covered supernatural phenomena, conspiracies, and cryptozoology.\nWhen her uncle came back with the magazine, my mom couldn\u2019t believe what she saw on the cover. It mentioned a flying dinosaur that had supposedly escaped from a secret facility in San Diego and had been spotted in Mexico. She showed the article to her mother, and it was enough to convince her that my mom wasn\u2019t making the story up.\nAccording to my mom, sightings of the creature were even reported in the local newspaper at the time.\nAbout 10 years ago, I decided to ask my mom and all of her sisters about this story to see if they still stood by it. By then, they were all successful, level-headed women living in the U.S. I expected at least one of them to brush it off or say it was just a childhood fantasy, but to my surprise, every single one of them said the same thing: Yes, it really happened.
