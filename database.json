Her children ranged in age from pre-school to late teens.\nShe was tall and wiry, with short, brown curly hair and pronounced eyebrows.\nShe set out to milk the cows at 5.30am.\nIt was normal for her to be up so early. She was a hard-working woman. As well as running dairy cows, she also held down a few other jobs. Locals would turn to her for advice if their cows were unwell.\nShe was a nurse aide at the local Lister Hospital. Her husband worked as a patrolman at Woodbourne air base about six kilometres from their home. Moreland had also worked there occasionally.\nMoreland\u2019s hobby was reading.\n\u201cWhen she wasn't working she was a great reader,\u201d said Donald Parker, when interviewed before his death in 2017. Parker married Moreland\u2019s eldest daughter in 1967.\n\u201cShe would read until two o'clock in the morning.\u2019\u2019\nThis chilly morning was routine. Moreland reached the cowshed, turned on the lights and radio, grabbed her torch and set off across the paddock.\nOver the next few decades, she would tell journalists, researchers and Air Force officials about what happened in the next 80 minutes.\nHere is what she claimed.\nHalf way across the paddock she saw a strange green glow through the low clouds.\nThe green glow broke through the cloud cover and became two lights, \u2018like eyes or big lamps\u2019.  Everything was bathed in an eerie light that overwhelmed her torch. Mi\u201cIt was a horrid sort of colour,\u2019\u2019 she later told a journalist.\n\u201cMy first thought was \u2018I shouldn\u2019t be here\u2019 and I made a dive for the trees.\u201d\nFrom her hiding place among a shelter belt of pine trees, she looked up.\nIt was the most beautiful thing she had ever seen.\nA circular craft about nine metres wide and with a curved glass cockpit silently descended towards her.\nTwo shafts of green light beamed down from its underside. Two rows of small, orange jets shot outwards like spokes from the rim of the disc.\nThe craft suddenly stopped descending and began to hover about four and a half metres from the ground.\ntrue\nThe jets disappeared and then reappeared pointing sideways in two rows. The top row span clockwise very fast, while the bottom row moved in the opposite direction, trailing orange flames.\nThe air on this cold July morning became warm and she noticed a low hum. She was \u201cscared stiff\u201d, but curious and enchanted by the lights.\nIt was an image she could still recall in detail decades later.\n\u201cIt was just imprinted indelibly on my mind. I just took it in. I saw everything in those few minutes.\u2019\u2019\nInside the curved glass cockpit, she could see two figures wearing shiny silver suits and helmets. The suits were tight like a wet suit and looked like they were made of aluminium foil.\nThe men were seated one in front of the other. Both had their backs to her. A flickering light shone up from below them, reflecting off their suits. Then one of the silver suited men emerged from the craft and walked towards her. She could see his face through a small visor in the helmet.\nHe was wearing a wide belt with a black disc at the centre. He had a harness on his chest that held a small dial and a series of tubes coming out of the helmet. His left hand was missing and was encased in a dark sheath.\nThen he shouted at her in a foreign language she did not recognise. He retreated back to the craft and got back on board.\nAfter a few moments, the jets starting shooting out from the craft again. It tilted at an angle and then shot up into the sky at great speed. As it retreated behind the clouds it made a soft, high-pitched whine.\nThen she was alone. Standing in a waft of hot peppery air. She was relieved that the attracting power of the green lights had gone, but didn\u2019t know what to do next. Eventually, she finished milking the cows.\n\u201cWhile I was milking I kept wondering and felt a bit shaken and puzzled, and did not quite know what to do about it.\u2019\u2019\nShe returned to the house and woke her husband Frederick to tell him what she had seen. She feared he would laugh at her, but he took her seriously and asked if she had called the police.\nShe rang the police at 7am.\nWoodbourne commanding officer Arthur Gainsford visited the farm and interviewed Moreland later that day.\nHer husband Frederick had told Gainsford about his wife\u2019s claims that morning.\nGainsford found Moreland calm and rational. Local police told him she was \u2018\u2019a rational and stable person from their personal knowledge of her when she was of assistance to them on another matter.\u2019\u2019\nHe also found a second witness. A local farmer called Roy Holdaway, who lived about seven kilometres from Moreland\u2019s house, saw a bright light in the sky about 30 minutes before Moreland\u2019s sighting.\nThe claim attracted publicity. Moreland gave an extensive interview to the Nelson Evening Mail about her sighting but Moreland did not tell the journalist about the one-handed man emerging from the craft. For now, she kept that detail to herself.\n**Note: After this sighting, a military investigation was carried out that related to possible Russian airship.\nSources for more information: https://interactives.stuff.co.nz/2018/03/finding-mrs-moreland/\nSources 2: Harold Fulton, APRO Bulletin and  NOUFORS", "media": null, "score": 152, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comment_count": 25, "over_18": false}, "10": {"id": "1fe7498", "locked": false, "subreddit": "cryptids", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "EfficientCatch5452", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1726282486.9580023, "created_utc": 1726051650.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/bu0hugmqt5od1.jpeg", "title": "Have we not talked about this?", "permalink": "/r/cryptids/comments/1fe7498/have_we_not_talked_about_this/", "selftext": "Apparently two hikers in Colorado snapped a photo of this handsome fellow by accident on a hike, and found him while going through their photos.

I was visiting family in southern France and did not want to stay at their place even if they offered, for personal reasons which I won't share here. Note that I visit them quite often and usually last minute, so I would never book the same place and I would sometimes book a hotel room which was more expensive but better for me as I don't necessarily want to socialize with the hosts. Even when I would book Airbnbs, I would always search flats or studio flats and not a room in a flat/house where other people live, as I want to be on my own so this is an important criteria for me.\nSo I book this Airbnb within walking distance to where my family members stay, and it looks very nice on paper. I think it was marketed as a house or ground floor flat with access to a yard and a garden. It was probably one of the cheaper options (I don't remember for sure but I wasn't going there for leisure or planning to have a very nice place for myself to have enjoyable holidays, if that makes sense, so I really wanted something for convenience and wouldn't pay extra for any kind of luxury). There were not a lot of reviews but the few ones were pretty positive.\nSo I go to that place with my suitcase, waiting in front of the house. I contact the landlord who should give me the keys but he's late. I spent at least one hour waiting outside, and I'm trying to be patient, realising at least the neighbourhood is pretty nice and seems safe, even if I need to walk through areas that are slightly dodgy to get there from where my relatives stay. The landlord finally arrives. He seems like a good man and apologises profusely, saying he was in another town visiting his cousin or friends, and time flew by. First red flag: he says they were drinking and didn't have time to sober up so he had to speed on the highway on his motorbike while being tipsy/drunk. He stops and asks me half-jokingly not to say that in my review. I get a bit serious and tell him he shouldn't drink and drive, but he says he really didn't want to make me wait further. I tell him I won't flag that in my review (spoiler alert: I will, but didn't want to start off on the wrong foot).\nThe guy is nice otherwise and seems trustworthy, very chatty and open to socialising. And frankly I was just happy I could finally get in and drop my stuff. Second red flag is when he tells me I will be living in a small flat adjacent to the bigger house he lives in, but I shouldn't worry because I would have my own place, own bathroom, own kitchen etc. I don't like that too much but I actually think it might be good because I am not super comfortable being on my own in a ground floor accommodation, knowing anyone can get into the yard and access the front door (again, I'm paranoid). So knowing that someone I \"know\" is closeby in case something happens gives me a sense of safety. God was I wrong.\nHe shows me around, all seems ok, it's pretty old but as I said, I wasn't looking for a luxury stay. The part where I would stay is on a lower level than street level, not exactly like a basement because there is access to a garden, but I need to walk down a set of stairs outside and get into flat through the backyard. This shows mostly when I'm in the bedroom, as I see through the windows that it's clearly at a lower level. Next red, or rather yellow flag is when he shows me a door close to the bedroom, which is the connecting door between my part and his house. I was kind of expecting that but thought he might need to at least cross the yard or access through the front door to get into my part of the house. He says this door stays closed and it's locked anyway, not as a warning for me not to try to open it, but more like \"you'll notice there is this door, it's useless for you and what's beyond it is not part of what you're renting\". We chat a little bit (too long for my taste because I was tired and also still annoyed at his lateness, and not in the mood to socialize). He gives me his phone number because \"Airbnb chat feature is not good, it's easier to use WhatsApp\". And then he leaves.\nI start to settle down, open my suitcase and get changed before leaving to visit the family. I then go back to the place in the evening and decide to have a shower. If I remember correctly, what I'm saying next happened before I took a shower because I remember locking the bathroom door, which I never do when I know I'm on my own, and I recall being quite anxious when taking the shower. So, biggest red flag before the last drop: I'm sitting on the bed, and hear a knock and someone saying my name. Two seconds later, before I get the chance to answer or even understand where the noise comes from, I hear keys turning in a lock and a door opening. As you might have guessed, it's the connecting door, next to the bedroom. The guy enters, and says he can't find his phone, and if he might have left it downstairs.\nI'm a bit shocked probably because if he had come 10 minutes later, I would have probably been naked, ready to take a shower, or maybe walking around in a towel, since I'm supposedly alone. I know it might sound like I'm a pussy but keep in mind I'm a relatively young woman alone in a house with a man in his 40s or 50s, who has control over when he can get into \"my\" place, at any time. I stay polite and try to tell him that no, I haven't seen his phone (I would have noticed, there's literally nothing except my open suitcase on a couch in the bedroom). He still gets in, speaking a lot and very fast while I'm sitting there, not fully realising what's happening and not having a chance to tell him to leave. He looks around the flat and obviously doesn't find the phone. Then he says sorry and probably asks if everything is fine, if I had dinner or something like that, and then leaves again.\nAt that point, I'm really wondering if I should stay or not since I know you get refunded only if you cancel 2 nights in advance. I just thought I would lose the money for the night that has started (it was already after 11 PM) and the following one, knowing I had booked at least 4 nights. I really needed to take a shower but questioning if I should, I try to see if there are available hotel rooms but it's already too late to book or already fully booked. I decide to take my shower real quick, wondering if he could hear the shower and decide that he forgot something else to get in again. Nothing bad happens. I then go back to the bedroom get dressed as fast as I can just in case, sit down and think.\nI decide that I will just stay for the night and I'll probably be less paranoid in the morning, if I'm still alive. That's when I notice the chairs in the bedroom. There are two and one of them has ropes tied around the armrests. The chairs are in good shape and the rope is definitely not there to keep the armrests fixed to the chair, as they are just loose. To this day I have no idea why they were there.\nI still think I should sleep there just for the night and try to use a chair to block the door handle in the bedroom, like in the movies. But guys, this only works in the movies. I try with both chairs trying to pile them up, even trying to use the ropes one way or another, the handle can still go down enough to open the door easily. I think that at least if I leave them in front of the door, I'll hear if someone tries to open it, but the door opens the other way and in any case, I didn't know what I'd do even if the noise woke me up.\nAgain, I'm paranoid and anxious but living alone, abroad, my moto is to never, ever, take risks for my own safety as I'm usually the only one who can save myself, so better avoid any tricky situation. Doesn't mean I never go out, but I wouldn't get drunk around people I don't trust, and I would take a cab if I feel unsafe going home on my own after midnight. I now live in a city that's rather safe but had too many bad encounters (unfortunately nothing unusual for most women) not to be careful.  So from an external point of view, this is a story about someone booking an Airbnb with good reviews, with a nice and friendly landlord who is just overly open because he likes to meet people, and the ropes are just a detail. But for my anxious and paranoid self, it's the premise for a horror story or thriller where you shout at the stupid and trusting victim to get away asap before the guy comes back. So I decide to call my brother, who came to pick me up around midnight for me to spend the rest of my stay at his place.\nTL;DR: I left my Airbnb in the middle of the night because my Airbnb host entered my flat through a connecting door without warning,  and after I saw ropes tied around the armrests of a chair in my bedroom.", "media": null, "score": 885, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "comment_count": 46, "over_18": true}, "13": {"id": "1fd6to9", "locked": false, "subreddit": "truecreepy", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Peter_Puck", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1726282487.467505, "created_utc": 1725933523.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truecreepy/comments/1fd6to9/my_wife_stepped_on_something_in_the_lake_we_found/", "title": "My Wife Stepped on Something in the Lake\u2026 We Found Out What It Was the Next Day.", "permalink": "/r/truecreepy/comments/1fd6to9/my_wife_stepped_on_something_in_the_lake_we_found/", "selftext": "My wife and I used to take our toddler daughter to this small lake near our house, almost like a pond really.

And I have had plenty of experience with using ouija boards in the past, so I know exactly what I\u2019m getting into and the whole process\n ( Example: went to a well know hotspot in my area which was a lake, where an infamous murder happened. Took a vid of myself alone sitting by the docks, there was hundreds of frogs croaking at once by the time I got there which was normal. But as soon as I asked the board and requested for complete silence, immediately the frogs stopped croaking in unison. Pretty cool tbh, multiple more stories but I wont dive to deep into it for the sake of time) \nAnyways back to the story. \nI made the board N tried it out in my room shared by two other people, the planchette didn\u2019t move however the environment around the house definitiely did over time. Items were getting knocked off the drawers, doors opening and closing, a shadowy figure seen multiple times in the closet and most notably a hand being seen inside the bathroom. Not an arm or full body just the hand can be seen peeking around the corner of the door, and if you\u2019re inside the shower, above the shower door you can see it just waving and twisting its fingers, pretty dope. My fellow housemates have had their own personal experiences. Such as having nightmares, having somebody whisper their name in their sleep and seeing shadows figures in their closet. Even the staff members here have had their own sightings, two staff members were in their office having a discussion when the main door opened and closed violently repeatedly.\nMake matters more interesting this place used to be a covent for nuns back in the 70\u2019s which transformed into a group home for recovering addicts and those under the penalty of the criminal justice system. Recently before this was a mens only group home, this housed only women and from word to mouth one of them overdosed here. \nAnyways just wanted to share my story to give others more insight on what ouija boards are capable of, very fun if you know what you are doing. Always be respectfull and close the portal when you are finished. Announcing you are done communicating and for whatever supernatural being is with you, to return wherever it came from. (I never closed the portal because I wanted other people here to experience some activity lol)\nTake care and be safe.", "media": null, "score": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "comment_count": 1, "over_18": false}, "15": {"id": "1ffdfvo", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ghosts", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "pinkcuppa", "link_flair_text": "Captured Apparition ", "time": 1726282488.1064334, "created_utc": 1726175152.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/32muyl2z0god1.jpeg", "title": "2 Dead People in 1 Picture.

I remember its coat being a shimmering silver and its bright piercing green eyes. \nAs this wolf was walking along the fence of our paddocks it locked eyes with mine and we just kinda stared at each other as he walked past me, both alone in the middle of the night, in the middle of nowhere. What happened next till this day instantly makes my spin shiver, as the wolf walked past he walked towards our barn with our horses in it. It became darker as it entered the barn but the other side of the barn still had a bright light illuminating the outside that I could clearly see. This wolf as it entered, half way through it went from the shape of a wolf to a very large, broad shouldered person. The horses didn\u2019t make a single sound and this person that now stood roughly 7 feet tall rounded the corner towards the open field but didn\u2019t emerge from the other side and I never saw it again.\nMy brother had his own encounter with this same wolf I\u2019m guessing, he told me that he woke up randomly one night from the feeling of being watched. He then looked out his window too see a very large wolf walking away from his window so I\u2019m guessing it was watching him sleep.\nThis place we lived at was old native ground, our barn was an old school house where the catholic priest would put the native children and teach them lessons on Christ, it even had the old desk and chairs inside still. My brother and I both saw children\u2019s faces in the panes of glass from that barn and lights turning on randomly.

So basically, I was beaten and ridiculed on a daily basis. \nI couldn't make any friends with my new classmates, all of my old friends from elementary school I got placed in different classes, and nobody was in the same after school groups as me anymore (we were also all in a scout group, but that disbanded before I got into middle school).\nI was also lonely that if someone talked to me without picking on me, it made me happy.\nI had a Google+ account (the only social media I could access at school) that I kept hidden from my parents, that I would use to check out my favorite fandoms and hopefully use to make some new friends.\nOne day I was on Google+ in the computer lab, and I had commented under a piece of fanart of a character I liked. The person who made the post had replied to me not even a minute later. I remember getting very excited seeing that notification, my heart sweeling up in excitement. The two of us spent the next ten minutes of my class talking to each other in the comments section. We ended up replying so much, we flooded a good portion of the comments with our talk.\nAfter I had to change classes, I logged back in on one of the chromebooks we had stored in the back of the class, and saw that she actually messaged me.\nHer name was Haley. At least, she told me that was her name. But years later, I'm not as sure it was actually her name.\nIn the message I got, \"Haley\" told me she was 2 years older than me, and that we had a lot of things in common. I spent the rest of the school day on my phone, not giving a  damn to anything in my classes.\nWe talked for the next week in our dms until she suggested that we message each other in a private chatroom. Later that day, we made a private chat on an online messaging site, and in our first conversation, we at first talked on messages.\nThen Haley asked if we could also do a voice call. I told her I wasn't sure, but she told me it was only to better hold a conversation with me, and  eventually after she asked me multiple times I gave in. After an hour of us talking, she then suggested we video chat. I agreed, both to make sure she was actually my age, but also to put a name to a face. Haley turned on her camera and... she did look in the same age range as me.\nI don't know why, but that fact haunts me more than anything else. The fact that she looked so close to my age, plus that she easily smiled and spoke so friendly to me, made me feel that I had nothing to be afraid of. So that led to me quickly believe that I could trust her. We ended up talking for hours after, with me practically on cloud nine the entire time.\nIn the beginning of our little friendship, things were going alright. We told each other about our schools, what we liked, and gushing over our favorite series we liked. We talked almost every day, and stayed up late talking nearly all night. We even exchanged a couple of silly pictures of ourselves and memes back and forth a lot.\nAfter we had been talking for six months, Haley asked me if I would like to meet her friends. At first, I was estatic, and the thought of having more friends made me so excited I didn't think twice before saying yes. Haley invites me in and I got to meet her other friends. I had a completely different feeling about these people compared to what I felt with Haley. Something made me feel unsafe in that chatroom, even though they all seemed nice and that Haley reassured me I could trust them.\nIt felt like my instincts were trying to warn me, but I wasn't sure about what, so I ignored it.\nMost of them were...much older than me. In a chat with her main friends there were six other people. Most of them were 18/19, but there were two guys that I distinctly remember being in their 20s. I asked how they all met, and they told me they all met either on another social media site, or from real life, but wouldn't answer anymore of my questions. I was a bit naive, so all of the red flags that were popping up went completely over my head.\nFrom constant loud talking, to frequently overlapping each other, the calls I were on with them were pure chaos. The messages were even worse, because they would frequently drop cuss words and topics that should not be brought up with someone who was still a minor. I tried building genuine connections with them, but they all acted dismissive to me and acted like I was annoying whenever I tried to talk in a conversation.\nNeedless to say, I did not like them very much. Haley, on the other hand, was all about them. She would pull the exact same habits, jokes, dirty words, and all of that with the others. They could say something super problematic, but she would be laughing right along with them. I was shocked by this version of Haley, because she never acted like this with me when it was just the two of us. We still talked a bunch, but slowly, she was talking to her other friends more than she was with me. At first I thought it was fine. But the more she ignored my messages, or didn't pick up my calls, the more I got bothered.\nWhen I called to confront Haley about blowing me off, she went ballistic on me. Saying that I was being selfish and that I didn't want her to talk to her other friends because I was jealous. I explained that wasn't true, but she wouldn't listen, and then hung up on me. Haley then ghosted me for almost a month, leaving me worried and upset over what happened.\nWhen she started talking to me again, I was so emotionally distraught, I was crying on our first call and apologizing for what I said the last time we talked. She told me it was fine, she just needed some time alone, and that she would talk to me a bit more.\nAnd indeed she did, although, not what I thought she would.\nHaley began to tell me she had depression, and that was the reason she wouldn't talk to me for a month. I didn't judge her about it, and said whatever she needed to talk about she could come to me. This led to her trauma dumping on me nearly every day, talking about how shitty her home life was, and how bad her relationship was with her mom, and how much she hated herself. I was there to offer an ear and some kind words whenever Haley called or messaged me about it.\nThis quickly became part of our routine. Almost daily, in the middle of us having any kind of conversation, she'd begin complaining about anything happening during her day. If not that, it would be about how ugly she thought she was, or how much her life sucked, and wanted to \"end things\".\nThe last one freaked me out the most. I was worried about her because we lived in different states, and I couldn't help her in person. Everytime she would become self-depricating, I would say otherwise, giving her compliments and words of affirmation for so long my throat ached and felt raw. And then, just as fast as she'd bring it up, she dropped that conversation, and we talked like we were before.\nHaley also began calling for long periods of time and messaging me late into the night. Phone calls would stretch for hours at a time, and her texts would come in until 3 or 4 in the morning. The thing was, it was mainly her talking now. Every phone call, she'd take over the conversation. If I didn't message her back quickly enough, she'd spam multiple texts back to back faster than I can read them. I would try to end them myself, but every time I would try, Haley would chastise me for wanting to leave our conversation when not long ago I wanted to have her attention. She basically guilt tripped me back into talking to her, and it worked.\nEven if I had lost interest in our talks or didn't want her to message me diuring class, I would still let her talk and reply. At least I still had her attention and she still wanted to talk to me.\nThis all went on in a cycle for two years, and it left me feeling more anxious and exhausted than anything else ever did.\nIt felt like we had nothing in common anymore, and she either ghosts me for a week, or spends the entire weekend texting me nonstop. The topics of her self worth have also gotten worse. They escalated to her messaging me \"Goodbye.\" or \"I can't live like this anymore...\" without responding to any of my following messages or calls. Alongside of that, she would send me pictures of her...\"marking\" herself, telling me about how it felt to do it.\nThe sight of those messages would send me into panic attacks, and every time I would panic and message her after, I would be sent into tears. Not only that, the group chat with her other friends got worse. Arguments broke out frequently, drama and gossip spread like an oil spill, and it led to people being blocked/unblocked almost every few days. I hated talking to them, they began ganging up on me in messages, and  Haley was often the first one to make rude jokes about me that they would all laugh at.\nI began getting sick of it, and would stop messaging and calling both Haley and her friends. Despite her begging me to.\nOne late night, while the group was in an argument over text, I hit my breaking point. I was tired of all the drama and them treating me like shit all the time. So I messaged the group chat that I had enough of them, and privately messaged Haley that I needed a break. Then I left both chat rooms, blocked everyone I talked to, deleted my messaging account, and deleted the site from my computer's history.\nOnce it was all over, I felt like I had been freed from some kind of prison, and all I could do was cry in relief and euphoria over the whole thing being over.\nI later found out that all of the pictures Haley had sent me were all stock images and photoshopped. I also found out from a bit of digging through her background, a lot of things didn't add up. I learned that she was actually a LOT older than what she originally told me, at least 6 years older than me. Meaning that when we first met when I was 14, she was about twenty years old.\nMany things from our interactions still haunt me, especially the picture of her \"marks\" and her scathing self-depricating messages. For almost three months, I would have nightmares about Haley getting back in contact with me and what she would say or do to me.\nI have many better friends now, and I am absolutely certain I will never have to hear from Haley again. But sometimes, I still wonder who that woman really was, and what was it about me that she was interested in? Hopefully, I won't ever find out.\nSo, to Haley, if you somehow ever find this story, let's not meet again.\nEdit: For clarification (and the fact I got tired of explaining it in the comment section), the pictures she would send me when we would message each other were all pictures of her \"friends and family\", places she claimed to have been to, and items she owned. A few weeks after I blocked Haley, I found them stored on my computer. I got curious so I reversed image searched the pictures she sent me, and they were all stock photos. Every result I found from her picture led back to a stock photo site, with the only difference between them being that she cropped out the logo of the site from the pictures.

This happened in M\u00e9xico city. Neiborghood called San Pedro de Los Pinos. I was about 13 or 14 years old (35 today). It was around 4 or 5 pm so there was plain of sun trough closed orange courtains on my parents room on a PH apartment. The room had a big window on two walls facing east and south. No smartphones or small videocameras then. My mother calls me and my sister because she was seeing something (i have vague memories of how this whole thing began) dunno if I saw it right away as I walked into her room but I do remember sitting on the bed looking at the shadow of a person as if it was floating right outside the window. At first we tried to make sense of it, thinking it could be a prank or a bird or whatever. But it wasn't going away, it actually started moving, and I would even say it was \"gliding sideways\" didn't move its arms at any time, it was just sor of standing straight and fkng gliding. We were very scared at this point and my mom decided to stand up and see what's behind the curtains (sis and I are screaming in fear to her not to do so). Mother lifts up the curtain and we see nothing there... as she puts it back down she walks backwards like in terror to join us on the bed. We were all terrified and screaming at this point. We couldn't think of even leaving the fkn room, we were paralyzed I guess... Then this shadow glided to the end of the window and fkng turned around and continued to be visible on the other window (different wall and different axis of protection relative to the sun) this was what made me feel the fkn panic. It continued to glide and until the end of that other window and went to where my sister's room window would be. I then ran the fuck out of there to go look for my friend next door to tell him all we just saw. To this day I have nightmares with that and I can't look a curtain with some light though it without looking for that shadow or something. I don't even know if I'm afraid to see it again. I just would like to know wtf was that. And I just would like to know if anybody else has seen this type of shit. \ud83d\ude2a \n(I created that image with this story on chatgpt and it pretty much nailed it.

My favorites were three different Pikachu; one plump and sitting, one standing with an ear sticking out sideways, and the last sitting with a small pink ball. I played with them so many times. How they are listed is how I had them in front of me. But then I blinked. And suddenly, they were all different.\nI remember it so well. The sitting one shrank, the standing one grew, and the one with the pink ball turned into a copy of the first. I sat and stared at them for minutes, a feeling of fear and dread sinking into my system. When my shock wore off, I threw all the pokemon back in the bin and put it away. I didn\u2019t say anything about it when it happened because I just assumed this was a part of the world, and weird things like this just happened sometimes. Again, I was 4.\nI have many memories of when I was little, but this one is just so vivid in my mind and won\u2019t leave me alone. My grandmother gave those pokemon toys away years ago, but I did some research and have found official Pikachu toys that match the first two. But I cannot find any Pikachu with the small pink ball. It\u2019s like it vanished out of existence. It bothers me to this day.

But he will vent his anger against the people of the holy covenant and reward those who forsake the covenant.\n\u201cHis army will take over the Temple fortress, pollute the sanctuary, put a stop to the daily sacrifices, and set up the sacrilegious object that causes desecration. He will flatter and win over those who have violated the covenant.\nBut the people who know their God will be strong and will resist him.\u00a0- Daniel 11:28-32\nNow is the time to truly know our Lord and Savior.\nBefore you walk away saying that you know Him already, have you examined yourself according to His word?\nThink carefully about what is right, and stop sinning. For to your shame I say that some of you\u00a0don\u2019t know God at all.\u00a0\u2013 I Corinthians 15:34\nRemember that those who do good prove that they are God\u2019s children, and\u00a0those who do evil prove that they do not know God.\u00a0- III John 1:11c\nHe died for everyone so that those who receive his new life will no longer live for themselves. Instead, they will live for Christ, who died and was raised for them. - II Corinthians 5:15\nBut anyone who keeps on sinning does not know him\u00a0or understand who he is. - I John 3:6b\n\u201cNot everyone who says to Me, \u2018Lord, Lord,\u2019 shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven.\nMany will say to Me in that day, \u2018Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in Your name?\u2019\nAnd then I will declare to them,\u00a0\u2018I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!\u2019\u00a0- Matthew 7:21-23\nNow we see that when someone continues on in sin, they do not know Jesus Christ. And Jesus calls them workers of lawlessness...\nSo, what\u00a0is\u00a0lawlessness?\nWhoever commits sin also commits lawlessness, and\u00a0sin is lawlessness.\nAnd you know that He was manifested to take away our sins, and in Him there is no sin.\nWhoever abides in Him does not sin. Whoever sins has neither seen Him nor known Him.\nLittle children, let no one deceive you. He who practices righteousness is righteous, just as He is righteous.\nHe who sins is of the devil, for the devil has sinned from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil.\nWhoever has been born of God does not sin, for His seed remains in him; and he cannot sin, because he has been born of God. - I John 3:4-9\nWell, how can we know that we actually know Him then?\nNow by this we know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments.\nHe who says, \u201cI know Him,\u201d and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.\nBut whoever keeps His word, truly the love of God is perfected in him. By this we know that we are in Him.\nHe who says he abides in Him ought himself also to walk just as He walked. - I John 2:3-6\nDon\u2019t you see how wonderfully kind, tolerant, and patient God is with you? Does this mean nothing to you? Can\u2019t you see that his kindness is intended to turn you from your sin?\nBut because you are stubborn and refuse to turn from your sin, you are storing up terrible punishment for yourself. For a day of anger is coming, when God\u2019s righteous judgment will be revealed.\u00a0He will judge everyone according to what they have done.\u00a0He will give eternal life to those who keep on doing good, seeking after the glory and honor and immortality that God offers.\u00a0But he will pour out his anger and wrath on those who live for themselves, who refuse to obey the truth and instead live lives of wickedness. - Romans 2:4-8\nWe see then that those who practice sin unto death will face the consequences for it (Ephesians 5:5), despite professing faith\u00a0and\u00a0despite having good works.\nAnother question comes up: How is it that Jesus could say to someone who had faith in Him and did wonderful works in His name that He\u00a0never\u00a0knew them? Is it not because He has forgotten all the righteousness that they did by Him?\n\u201cBut\u00a0when a righteous man turns away from his righteousness and commits iniquity, and does according to all the abominations that the wicked\u00a0man\u00a0does, shall he live?\u00a0All the righteousness which he has done shall not be remembered;\u00a0because of the unfaithfulness of which he is guilty and the sin which he has committed, because of them he shall die. - Ezekiel 18:24\nTurn and live!\n\u201cSon of man, give your people this message: The righteous behavior of righteous people will not save them if they turn to sin,\u00a0nor will the wicked behavior of wicked people destroy them if they repent and turn from their sins.\u00a0When I tell righteous people that they will live, but then they sin, expecting their past righteousness to save them, then none of their righteous acts will be remembered. I will destroy them for their sins. - Ezekiel 33:12-13\n\ud835\udc6e\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc85 \ud835\udc6f\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc94 \ud835\udc6e\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc97\ud835\udc86\ud835\udc8f

Us three are good friends and almost everynight we went out into the woods or just walking past them. We have a strange mind that we wanna see something strange no matter what.\nWell, one night we did. We was going home already it was so late, probably around 21:00 or so. We agree on checking one last place and going home after that. We went to the place, it was a abondened horse ranch. Not far away from my friends house.   \nWe saw a random humanoid like creature on the end of the road. It was full white and glowing. But it didn't light the ground nor trees around it. We wanted to go close to see what it was. We started walking towards it when it suddenly looked like it turned around. It wasn't walking away, it stood in one place. We panicked and ran home. \nAt home we started shouting and yelling at each other cus non of us know what it was and everybody said different things than the other. We agreed on going back and finding out what is it to see who was right.\nThe second time we went there we saw it again, it was still there. This time we went closer. All of a sudden we heard a dog barking at us. And we ran away. The dog was white like the creature and stood on a empty plain on our right side. Its really strange too cus we all had the same experience but we all see compleatly different things.\nMe: I saw the dog. It was big and white. No fence between us nor chain on the dog. \nMy friends: Didn't see it but heard it bark.\nThe strange part is that obviusly we run at different speeds. There was like almost 10m-15m difference between us BUT we all heard it directly behind us. And when at the end of the street we stop and looked back. The dog disappered. \nMy guesses is that humanoid thing use a \"Halucination attack\" on us. \nWhat do you think? what could this creature be?", "media": null, "score": 16, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "comment_count": 8, "over_18": false}, "71": {"id": "1fbwsg4", "locked": false, "subreddit": "cryptids", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "GRCtron", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1726282524.8851779, "created_utc": 1725799090.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/sjyurwoqyknd1.jpeg", "title": "Went to the international cryptozoology museum in Portland Maine.

What happened to me and my family in our old home still chills me to the bone.\nA few years ago, my family moved into a large, old house that had been in my family for generations. It\u2019s a beautiful place with a lot of character, but from the moment we moved in, something felt off. \nThe first sign was the constant feeling of being watched. We would frequently hear footsteps when no one was around, and doors would open and close on their own. My parents brushed it off as the house settling or old plumbing, but I wasn\u2019t convinced.\nOne night, I was home alone while my parents were out. I was in the living room watching TV when I heard someone calling my name from upstairs. It sounded like my mom, but when I went up to check, the house was empty. I called out and got no response. I checked every room, but no one was there.\nA few nights later, while I was trying to sleep, I felt a cold hand touch my shoulder. I turned around to find nothing but the dark, empty room. My heart raced, and I barely slept that night.\nThe final straw came one evening when we were having a family dinner. A picture frame fell off the wall and shattered on the floor. When we picked it up, the picture was of a woman we didn\u2019t recognize. We had never seen her before, and she wasn\u2019t a relative. My parents did some research and found out the woman had lived in the house decades before and had died under mysterious circumstances.\nSince then, we\u2019ve had the house blessed and tried to ignore the strange occurrences, but the feeling of unease never fully went away. I still wonder who or what was trying to communicate with us. \nHas anyone else experienced something like this? I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts or if you have any advice on dealing with a haunting.\nThanks for reading.", "media": null, "score": 13, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "comment_count": 2, "over_18": false}, "73": {"id": "1fdlmsi", "locked": false, "subreddit": "letsnotmeet", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Creative-Nectarine82", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1726282525.2456753, "created_utc": 1725984498.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1fdlmsi/convenience_store_creep/", "title": "Convenience Store Creep", "permalink": "/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1fdlmsi/convenience_store_creep/", "selftext": "This was 11 years ago. I was 19 working at a a gas station that's part of a chain in my area. There were these 2 guys who were marines that would come in regularly. The one guy was of Asian descent and would always try to flirt with me. I acted oblivious to it and went on withh my day. After they had been coming in for a while he asked me out. This guy was 35 (I carded him when he bought cigarettes bc our store was super strict about carding everyone so I knew his age). I said no and kept it professional and asked if he needed anything else. He would ask me out every time he came in and would get more and more frustrated when I said no. Just his body language and whole mood changed when I said no. I told my manager he was making me uncomfortable and she didn't seem to care and said to treat all customers with respect. \nCouple months later my friend was looking for a used car on Craigslist and she decided to look at the missed connections section to laugh at all the posts on there. It's not a thing anymore but it used to be kind of like a dating section where you could post about seeing someone you were interested in but didn't get to exchange numbers or talk or whatever. Low and behold this guy posted one with my name and the name of the store I worked in and the town. I don't have the most common first name and I'm the only person there with that name (we had to wear name tags) and I knew 100% it was about me. It was about how he saw me at work, thought I was pretty and wanted to go on dates with me. I was so creeped out. I showed my dad and he emailed the guy from the listing telling him to fuck right off. I printed it and showed my boss and this bitch told me to \"just go on a date with him and say you're not interested\". I was livid.\nAbout a week later this guy's friend came in alone. Mind you these men are marines and not small guys. I ring him up and he asks me \"what's your fucking problem? You don't wanna go out with my friend bc he's Asian? He really likes you. Racist\" I stood my ground and said \"I won't go out with your friend bc he's 35 and he is harassing me\". Luckily that was the last I saw either of them. \nI got fired about a week later and got another job waiting tables. Never saw that guy again and hope I never do. Manager fired me for no reason. I found out years later she got fired for unlawful termination. She fired anyone she didn't like for personal reasons. I hope she never has a daughter. \nTo the marine that harassed me, I hope we never meet again.", "media": null, "score": 96, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "comment_count": 8, "over_18": true}, "74": {"id": "1fepe0n", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ghosts", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Luv33v33", "link_flair_text": "Personal Encounter ", "time": 1726282525.9850817, "created_utc": 1726100253.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/1fepe0n/saying_one_final_goodbye_to_my_soul_buddy/", "title": "Saying one final goodbye to my soul buddy", "permalink": "/r/Ghosts/comments/1fepe0n/saying_one_final_goodbye_to_my_soul_buddy/", "selftext": "Years ago I (39F) met a man almost 40 years my senior. He came into my life at I time I really needed a friend. I just happened to start talking to him one night outside a bar and we hit it off. I felt such a connection to him and told him that I felt he was my \"soul buddy\". Over the years, he became a very close friend and we went through so much together. He shared with me what it was like for him growing up in the 60s and 70s as a gay man, and how he's beaten throat cancer and I told him stories from my life that I'd never shared with anyone. We really were soul buddies.\nLast year, I learned he had passed away. I felt so much guilt because we hadn't spoken in almost a year. I had plenty of opportunities to reach out, as I'm sure he did, but we just hadn't. I was, and still am heartbroken. Since he passed, I've asked for a sign from him to let me know he was ok and as far as I'm aware, there has been nothing. Until this week. \nA few nights ago, he made a small appearance in one of my dreams. I saw him and thought I'd just say hi another time. Then I woke up and realized I'd missed an opportunity to say goodbye. \nThen again this afternoon, I lay down to take a nap. In my dream, I was standing on my porch. A woman I know was standing off to the right and she pointed at a man in a puffy rainbow colored jacket with his back to me. She said \"You need to help him get home.\" I realized it was my friend and he was wandering around as if he was lost. I ran to him and hugged him so tightly and told him I missed him while I cried. He said nothing. I looked to the woman and said \"I don't know where to take him.\" And she said \"You do.\" So I took him over to some chairs and sat with him and held his hand until he disappeared. \nI woke up crying with an ache in my chest. I felt like that was the goodbye and I felt a sadness as if that was the last time I'd see him and I wished he would have said something to me. So, while I'm completely heartbroken, I'm so happy he came back to see me before he left.
