A.B. worried about the eventual car breakdown did not care too much about their presence believing them to be ENEL technicians despite the obvious strangeness of their attire and appearance. A.B he managed to reach his destination even if a little dazed, But the strangeness was yet to come. The next day at the same\nbend, his car stopped again, A.B, frightened, noticed again the two strange characters he had seen the day before, but this time the scene was more lit: one of them was taller and more robust (about two and a half meters), and the other smaller, both wore a suit of appearing metal on which different tubes of different size and length were applied on the suits, the two they seemed to have no face and seemed to be immersed as if in a green halo. A.B, tried over and over again to restart his 127, the car would start itself after the two beings disappeared from his view into the bush as they walked backwards (or perhaps forward, and this is perhaps why A.B, did not see their faces). A being with similar characteristics was seen on January 17th, almost 20 days before the\ncase of Marzano di Torriglia which later became famous as the Zanfretta case (see Aliens in Italy,case n, 55); the case was reported to the researcher Luciano Boccone and it was also similiar to this case in which the being was equipped with a diving suit about two and a half meters high with an elongated head gata, yellow eyes and surrounded by a green halo, with a hopping and \"slipping\" gait.

At the time Collins called The Aveley Abduction \u201cprobably the most important British case ever\u201d and it still gets heralded today as such by those in UFO research communities.\nOn late Sunday evening October 27th 1974, a run of the mill Essex family were driving a route between Harold Hill and Aveley to see relatives. The Avis family, consisting of John, aged 32, his wife, Elaine, aged 28, and their three children: Kevin, aged 10, Karen, aged 11, and Stuart, aged 7, were on Hacton Lane about one mile out from Hornchurch with, for them, the roads noticeably quiet even for a Sunday night.\nElaine recalled the car jerking violently as the mist curled around the car at a point in the journey, it was Kevin, the only one of the children awake, who asked his parents about a light he could see above the country lane houses.\nCollins reports, \u201cGlancing round, both John and Elaine saw, at an angle of about 25 degrees \u2013 30 degrees above the skyline, an oval-shaped, pale blue iridescent light, like a big star, over the top of the houses to their left\u201d.\nJust as the mist was seen by the Avis family, the radio started crackling and smoking, causing John to pull out its wires. Then they were engulfed by the fog, still travelling around 30mph.\nElaine recalled the car jerking violently as the mist curled around the car. With two children asleep and Kevin awake, John and Elaine recall it was \u201cvery light\u201d inside the fog and that they \u201cfelt very cold\u201d. A tingling sensation was felt, and there was dead silence. They recall being in the mist for \u201cwhat seemed like a second or two\u201d before they were out.\nThere was a jolt described as \u201clike a car going over a hump back bridge\u201d and the \u201cmist\u201d was gone. Elaine remembered asking \u201cis everybody there?\u201d with herself and John both feeling very nervous and frightened, although no ill effects were remembered and the two children aside from Kevin still asleep. The couple don\u2019t recall talking a large amount about what had happened and the situation instead provoked a \u201clet\u2019s just get home\u201d atmosphere. The couple expected it to be around 10:20pm when they arrived home, but it was 1am, leaving  around three hours the couple could not account for.\nThe family reported unnerving incidents around the family home after the encounter including an object levitating There were noticeable changes in the family following the incident, Collins reports. Before Christmas that year John had a nervous breakdown and stopped working, before later taking on a job working with mentally handicapped people, something he had wanted to do for years. The job \u201cfell into his lap\u201d, a different direction from his usual carpentry and construction work; he would also begin writing poems about life. Elaine started attending college and reportedly grew in confidence.\nAdditionally, John & Elaine stopped eating meat and became far more health conscious in their nutrition, with the taste of meat/fish now making them ill. And whereas before the incident they would \u201cenjoy a good drink\u201d, the couple would now not touch a drop of alcohol. The couple reportedly also became very environmentally conscious, with John also quitting his \u201c60 to 70 a day\u201d smoking habit. Kevin\u2019s reading age at school reportedly was \u201cwell beyond his years\u201d whereas prior to the incident it had been reported as \u201cbackwards of his age\u201d. The family reported unnerving incidents around the family home after the encounter including an object levitating, \u201cclicking noises\u201d and the sound of \u201cMorse code\u201d, and young Kevin reportedly seeing a strange figure beside his bed on one occasion, similar in looks to that of a clown.\nWhen questioned by Collins, both John & Elaine would admit to strange dreams in which creatures would examine them on long tables and other visions of that ilk. At this point, Collins sought hypnotist Leonard Wilder to query the couple\u2019s subconscious and see if these dreams were masking real abduction memories.\nJohn was first to agree to hypnosis while Elaine declined preferring to try and move on and \u201cforget it\u201d instead. It was decided hypnotising Kevin was not an option due to his age and the impression any memories may leave. John, the first under hypnosis, began to remember that as the car entered the mist, he found himself in a big room with tall \u201cpeaceful\u201d beings, in one-piece colourless suits. John recalled that they had pink eyes and communicated by telepathy. They put him on a table and ran a bar like instrument over his body.\nHe asked where they came from; they showed him \u201ca map but not a map\u201d, and gave an explanation of which he could only remember \u201cPhobos\u201d. They travel, he was told, almost instantaneously. They explained how but he could not understand. A small being was present at the table; it had fur-like covering and made chirping sounds; it served the tall beings.\nLeonard Wilder remarked to Andrew Collins that John was an excellent subject for hypnosis, and a second session was arranged. In the second session John remembered that when the car entered the mist, a white beam cut through it, and lifted the car. The next thing he knew was that they were in a very large room. Here, an \u201cexaminer,\u201d \u201csmaller than us,\u201d with big eyes and a mouth \u201cnot like ours\u201d examined him.\nThe tall beings had no visible mouths. John understood that their propulsion system used a magnetic \u201cvortex\u201d, though he had begun to mutter somewhat incoherently his responses at this point. He encountered only three of the tall beings, and only one communicated with him. When John was asked the reason for the beings visit to earth, he replied, \u201cNo visit. They are here always.\u201d Asked where they came from, he said \u201cThere was no need for them to say,\u201d and that they have no need to return home; \u201cthey have more than one base,\u201d he said.\nAfter being brought out of hypnosis, he said that at this point he felt prevented from saying anything more (following questioning surrounding the beings origin). My understanding is that the sessions were stopped there as memories came flooding back naturally outside of hypnosis. Collins reports to have kept in touch with the family and that John & Elaine would later separate with the former moving to Scotland to live with a new partner. End\nThis case is still spoken of frequently in UFO circles: Andrew Collins did a very accurate report at the time and since; but there have been a number of articles subsequently written by others that are way off mark to say the least; for instance, contrary to some reports the witness is neither \"uneducated\" nor \"unskilled\"; far from it in fact.\nPeople seem to forget that John was an actual abductee and he reported what he believed took place; it was truly a life-changing event for him.\nJohn has explained that he would like to be more involved with the UFO scene but every time he tries to do so, strange things seem to happen around him and his family.\nHis encounter led to a whole catalogue of events which even he still finds hard to understand.\nSources: http://www.beamsinvestigations.org/The%20Aveley%20Alien%20Abduction%20Case%20-%20October%2027th%201974.htm", "media": null, "score": 344, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comment_count": 38, "over_18": false}, "26": {"id": "1e9hnjg", "locked": false, "subreddit": "cryptids", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "LyricalWillow", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1722048239.4244719, "created_utc": 1721663459.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/srud0x9ed3ed1.jpeg", "title": "Madrid gets serious", "permalink": "/r/cryptids/comments/1e9hnjg/madrid_gets_serious/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 417, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comment_count": 18, "over_18": false}, "27": {"id": "1eakx4t", "locked": false, "subreddit": "thetruthishere", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Diligent_Ant1373", "link_flair_text": "Unidentified?", "time": 1722048239.6444516, "created_utc": 1721773250.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1eakx4t/still_not_sure_what_i_saw_that_night_but_it_wasnt/", "title": "Still not sure what I saw that night but it wasn't a dog.

We had not been drinking prior to this it done any drugs. It's around 11 or 12 at night and we pull up to a stop sign. My friend that was driving didn't know which way to turn so him and another friend up front were trying to figure out which way to go. \nWe're stopped there for about 15 seconds and I look to the right and see what looks like a dog in the road. It's probably about 15 yards away from us (I suck at measuring distance but basically close though to see the shape clearly but not close enough to be able to make out any details.) He was on all fours.. at this point. I then focus my attention to my friends in the front but out of my peripheral, I see the creature stand up. At this point, my full attention is now on this creature. \nI scream \"What the eff is that?!!\" and everyone turns to look at it. It was about 3 and a half feet tall and its knees were bent inwards. It started walking towards us and got under a streetlight but there was zero features. No eyes, mouth. Anything. Just a solid black figure. We book it out of there and I look back to see the thing trying to chase us but with its deformed legs, it wasn't able to run well. \nIt's bothered me all these years wondering what it was and we didn't really talk much about it directly after that. We all lost contact but a few years ago, I started thinking about that incident and started second guessing what happened. I messaged the friend that was driving and said \"Hey, remember that one night, when me, you, so and so, and so and so got lost looking for that party?\" And he immediately responded with \"And we saw that thing in the road that tried to chase us?\" \nHas anyone seen anything like this before? The inward bent knees is what really messed me up. I live in the USA in East Tennessee if that can help narrow down what this creature may have been.

For context I grew up in a very religious household and went to a church every Sunday and Courtney is probably the only person from my old church that I still keep in contact with. The situation started at the reception. Courtney was super excited to see me and was definitely the only person who felt that way judging from all the stares from the people at my old church. I sat down at my table and started playing something on my phone when some guy sat next to me. He said that the seating chart said that he was supposed to sit at my table and introduced himself as the groom's friend Anthony. He was pretty cute so I spent a lot of time talking to him and we really hit it off. He didn't seem to judge me for being an atheist and seemed genuinely interested in me.\nWhen the dance started they started playing Brown Eyed Girl and he offered to dance with me. We danced together for most of the night until he left to go to the bathroom and a little later I did too. When I came out I saw that my purse wasn't on the table which was weird because I swore I left it on there. I was tired and thought I had just left it in my car so I went in the parking lot and into my car to look for it and found it on the center console. I still thought it was weird because I really thought I had brought it inside but at that point it was pretty late in the night so I didn't think much of it. I danced some more and noticed Anthony was gone. I asked the groom who said he had gone home because he wasn't feeling too good.\nPretty soon I felt pretty sick too so I said bye to Courtney and went to my car. As I put my keys in ignition I looked behind me and saw something weird. It looked like something had ducked down from the trunk. I took my keys out and looked back there and that was when I saw him. Anthony was crouched down in the trunk of my car. I started screaming and ran out with him chasing after me. I went inside and told Courtney who immediately told her husband who walked me back to my car where Anthony was nowhere to be seen. Courtney's husband said that he didn't see his car anywhere so he probably left. I left and I still feel sick to my stomach thinking about it. He could've easily gone home with me and killed me if I hadn't looked back. Courtney said that she feels terrible that she invited him and that she had no idea he would do that. I haven't stepped out of my house since because I'm worried that if I do he'll be waiting for me like he was before.\nUPDATE : The last couple days have been kind of crazy so I haven't had the chance to look but thank you all for your advice that I wish I'd have known about earlier. Unfortanutley my address was on my ID and as I learned now Anthony took photos of it. Anthony and the groom aren't exactly friends but they know each other well enough for him to be invited. After the whole fiasco the groom tried to text Anthony about it but got no response. Anthony showed up at my job and lurking around the parking lot before he ran off when he saw security. He left me a note on my windshield that just says \"I'm watching\". Security at my job has been notified about him so hopefully I'm safe there. I was told by other people that went to the wedding that he was introducing himself as my boyfriend and that he was planning on proposing. I'm currently trying to file a restraining order against him and feel horrified. He lives in my city and knows where I live so I'm staying at my aunt's house as I speak.

People often comment on how deep the footprints are pressed into the ground, and this is evidence of bigfoot's great size and weight.  \nIt usually goes something like this \"The footprints were 2\" deep in the hard-packed soil, while my own boot prints hardly made a mark!\"\nI'm in vacation right now, with too much time on my hands, and I've been thinking about the physics behind this.  Bear with me for a long post - I want to get this down while it's fresh in my mind.\nThe depth of a track is determined by the pressure the foot applies to the ground, right?\nAnd the heavier the body, the greater the pressure, right?\nBut pressure is also affected by the surface area of the foot.  There is less pressure on the ground if it is spread over a wide area.\nThe equation in physics is: pressure = force/area.  We can apply this to bigfoot tracks.\nSay we have a bigfoot of 800lbs/360kg (I use kg as they're easier for me - this is how I was taught physics in school).  He has feet that are  18 inches (45cm) by 8 inches (20cm).\nFor the ease of the maths, let's assume that his foot is a rectangle 45cm x 20cm.  It doesn't affect my thinking to assume this.  \nSo our bigfoot has a foot that is 45cm by 20cm or 0.09 square metres.  This carries his weight of 360kg.  This means that the pressure he exerts to make his footprint is an impressive 4,000 kg per square metre.\nWith me so far?\nThe pressure from a bigfoot track is a lot, but how does that compare to a human?\nMy feet are 27cm by 10cm, and I weigh a portly 100kg.  The area of my foot is 0.027 square meters (assuming a rectangle).\nThis means that the pressure I put on the ground with each footstep is 3,700 kg per square metre.\nI don't apply the same amount of pressure as the bigfoot, it's true, but it's close.  And some humans may weigh a bit more, some a bit less.  Some bigfoots are bigger than others.\nBut the basic maths shows us that there isn't a significant difference between the force applied by a bigfoot foot and that from a human foot.  Certainly not enough for the bigfoot to leave 2\" deep tracks while the human barely makes an impression.\nBased on some simple physics, I'm going to go out on a limb and say that far from being a sign of authenticity, deep bigfoot tracks are in fact a sign that they have been faked or altered in some way, or that the storyteller is exaggerating.\nTL:DR - the extra area of a bigfoot foot largely cancels out their higher weight, and the force they apply to the ground to make footprints isn't much different to a human.", "media": null, "score": 583, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "comment_count": 148, "over_18": false}, "41": {"id": "1ec4iga", "locked": false, "subreddit": "humanoidencounters", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "gamerbrolol852", "link_flair_text": "Unidentified", "time": 1722048247.9528825, "created_utc": 1721937837.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Humanoidencounters/comments/1ec4iga/holy_sht_i_found_my_community/", "title": "Holy sh*t I found my community", "permalink": "/r/Humanoidencounters/comments/1ec4iga/holy_sht_i_found_my_community/", "selftext": "In Western Australia tasker st pretty sure one of the last houses down, it\u2019s like a drive in road with houses going down, anyway 2022/2023 im not completely sure but it was while this little apartment complex was under construction I went inside the house next to it, it was dark and eerie then for a split second I saw a tall red humanoid that reached the doorframe and a thing with this weird horn like bumps on its head\nedit for those who are asking what happened next I don\u2019t think anything happened since but I\u2019m pretty sure the same day I got back home the roof manhole was open and no one touched it/ no one was really tall enough to open it either and I\u2019ve recently been hearing crawling in the roof were trying to figure out if it\u2019s just rats or something else, call me paranoid but I feel like the crawling sounds too heavy to be mice", "media": null, "score": 51, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "comment_count": 16, "over_18": false}, "42": {"id": "1ebynxl", "locked": false, "subreddit": "cryptids", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "roadkilledrebis", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1722048248.3688867, "created_utc": 1721923597.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/u94mz2swuoed1.jpeg", "title": "There's an interesting similarity between the flat woods monster and iron maidens", "permalink": "/r/cryptids/comments/1ebynxl/theres_an_interesting_similarity_between_the_flat/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 235, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comment_count": 15, "over_18": false}, "43": {"id": "1e8o9j4", "locked": false, "subreddit": "thetruthishere", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Upper_Pick_8891", "link_flair_text": "Legend/Folklore", "time": 1722048248.5674396, "created_utc": 1721574099.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1e8o9j4/i_have_a_doppelg\u00e4nger/", "title": "I have a Doppelg\u00e4nger ", "permalink": "/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1e8o9j4/i_have_a_doppelg\u00e4nger/", "selftext": "I'm on vacation with my dad, and my mom texted me at 6am checking in on me because apparently, the night before my stepdad went downstairs and saw \"me\" (not sure what it was but I was not home) standing in the dark kitchen; and when he asked \"me\" if i was brought home earlier than expected, whatever it was just looked at him, smiled shrugged and walked off.

I remember the first time I met him, he made me feel uncomfortable but my mom shrugged it off because I was a shy kid. She had done her due dilligence and googled his name, coming across a court case HIM vs. State. It listed him as a convicted fellon of murder from back in the early 80's. I don't know how but he convinced her that it was a mistake. I guess because he had a very generic name, she believed him. \nWe were raised by him, called him dad, even at one point asking him to adopt us (the adoption never happened, thank god). He was a good dad to us... at first. Things started to get weird when I turned 12. Suddenly I wasn't allowed to have sleepovers, wasn't allowed to choose my own haircuts, wasn't allowed to watch Tv. \nIt escalated to padlocks on the fridge and pantry, having to ask permission to drink water, and never being allowed in the kitchen past 8pm. He was a master manipulator, so at the time we all thought it suckd but was normal 'punishment' despite us not having done anything to deserve it. I lost my door for weeks on end for stupid stuff like forgetting to do the dishes after dinner. Once when I was 16 I wanted to not go to my brother's soccer game so i could study, and he went into a blinding rage. I think that was the first time I ever was truly afraid of him. He was a large man, probably 4 times my weight at the time. I think that was the first time his mask fully slipped in front of me.\nHe started being weird and creepy towards me once I turned 18. One night as I was sleeping he came into my room and laid in my bed, saying he loved me. I was so tired I didn't even have time to think of how creepy it was until much later. I pushed him out of my room and went back to bed. The next day while me and my family were gone (he'd stayed behind) he trashed my sister's room for no reason. She was only about 11 at the time and was very upset. \nHe gave her the middle finger and my mom finally lost it, telling him to pack up his stuff. He brandished a gun, waving it in my face before taking off in his car. We called the cops and after nearly getting shot, he was arrested. We found out he was a murderer when his bond was set at a quarter of a million. He tried to lie to my mom again, but it didnt' work this time. I looked up the case and it was... way worse than just a murder. \nHe'd beaten someone to death with a metal pipe late at night in a highly populated park. I did not know this man, not truly. Neither had my mom. Not really. \nHe got out on bond (no idea who paid for that) and tried to come back to the house. I was the only one home, and I had no idea my sibilings had not locked the door when they left for the day. I was cooking pasta before heading to work when I heard the front door open. I peered my head to the front door and my blood ran cold as I saw him standing there. He said something to me but I dont remember what it was. I ran to the bathroom and locked the door, not even bothering to turn off the stove. \nI pressed up against the bathroom door and called my mom as he banged on the door asking me why I didn't love him. I was so afraid I nearly sent myself into an athesma attack. My mom had a family friend come by and pick me up. When they entered the house he wasn't there anymore. \nThat was the last time I saw him, back in 2017. He'd helped raise me and my sibilings for 13 years. He was the closest thing I ever had to a normal dad, which given everything is kind of sad when I think about it too much. \nI can't help but worry that I'll fall back into the same toxic and manipulative relationship. It's what I knew growing up, afterall. Maybe that's why I keep people at a distance now. \nThe reason I thought about this recently is because some true crime tiktokker actually covered the story on the man he murdered all those years ago, and I stumbled across it. One of his daughters even commented on the post giving more details about what it was like growing up with him. It was odd, thinking that so many of my peers could of put two and two together if they had seen the tiktok.  I know I'm a victim in all of this but I couldn't help but feel shame that I was connected to this man and his atrocities. \nI could end this with the typical 'so lets never meet again' but I know we won't, because he died. I didn't go to the funeral. Almost nobody did. From what my mom told me not even his parents went. The last thing I want to say is please don't give my mom any hate. She was manipulated into believing he was a good man and we've made peace with her on this particular subject. A lot of the things I mentioned happening in my childhood were things she didn't know about until he was already dead. One more thing, since this is a popular subreddit... if you think you know who I am based on this story, please keep it to yourself.

Living alone with my girlfriend, we had grown accustomed to our neighbors\u2019 domestic disputes, and I have to call the police often. I stumbled to the bathroom, as the walls there are thin and separated our duplex from theirs. As I approached the bathroom door, the entire house was dark, and a tall shadow was in my bathtub. I wasn't wearing my glasses, and I am incredibly near-sighted, so I struggled to discern whether the shadow was merely the shower curtain or...what it was.\nThen the shadow spoke. I don't know what he said, but the gut-wrenching panic I felt is still fresh. I screamed and fled back to my bedroom, slamming the door behind me. My girlfriend, now awake and terrified, joined me as I dialed the police. They instructed me to lock the door, but my bedroom doesn't have one. With the banging growing louder and more aggressive, I braced myself against the door, praying that help would arrive in time.\nTo my relief, the police arrived swiftly, in only 5 minutes! When I finally emerged from the bedroom, I found that they had dragged him, NAKED, from the bathtub, because he had been trying to shower. They were questioning him on my couch, while he was handcuffed. He was INCREDIBLY drunk, and had wandered into the wrong house. The one night we forgot to lock the doors. \nBut to the drunk, naked stranger who saw me squinting at him, pantsless, in the dark, let's not meet. \n(I caught this all on my camera outside my house.

My friend asked if we could turn around and go down the other turn instead but doing that led us to a dead end so we had to go back. As we drove down the road that felt menacing we passed a cemetery which had two beings that appeared to be humans standing in robes facing a statue of the blessed mother and waving a wand towards it, as we drove by we noticed that it seemed odd so we drove in to the gate and parked a few feet away from them to which they appeared to be statues at first but then without even moving they had started facing us and waving the wand over us. \nTheir faces looked largely expressionless but also had features that I can only describe as a mix between a witch and a pig. My friend that was driving took off and we started to head home, all feeling like something malicious was there. As we got further into the drive we realized that we were told to go back in the same direction as the GPS rerouted us back to the same coordinates that they were at. Needless to say we did not go back but we all returned home and felt sick all night. \nSome time had passed and I told another friend of mine about this experience and he said he wanted to go there because he had never experienced anything like it, we went and he started feeling sick as we pulled up again so he kept driving and left, later on that night he was home with only his girlfriend and they both heard what seemed to be something running up to the door and violently slamming on it, which also knocked some stuff on the shelves down but when they went looking through the house there was nobody there. \nI can\u2019t find any information on anything like this and I\u2019m very tempted to go back but I can\u2019t get myself to actually do it just yet out of fear and lack of understanding.

This took place in northern Virginia at about 9pm while we were walking on a path near some houses and trees. \nAs we were walking down the path, one of my friends kept on looking back because he was creeped out due to the location. I lived close to this area so I was relatively used to walking through this specific path, but the others lived a little further away and never walked there. My friend who was scared kept on insisting that we go to the main road and walk on the sidewalk instead. The path we were taking had plenty of lights, so it wasn\u2019t like it was pitch black. It was actually probably more visible than the sidewalk on the main road. \nOnce we got near a tunnel that would take us to the next neighborhood, my scaredy friend screamed that there was something behind us and began to run up the hill that lead to the main road. None of us believed him at first until we turned around to look. When the rest of us looked back, we all saw a tall white figure walking slowly in our direction. We all followed our other friend up the hill and kept on running until we came to a lit parking lot near other buildings. \nAt the time, I didn\u2019t know what that thing was. All I could remember was that it was tall and I couldn\u2019t see any arms on it. It was also bright white. It had a weird stride to it, as if it was taking long steps to avoid specific spots on the ground. It wasn\u2019t until I watched the famous \u201cFresno Nightcrawlers\u201d videos that I finally realized what I may have seen that night. The way it walked was spot on. The long legs and lack of arms was exactly what I saw. It also appeared out of nowhere because my friend was constantly looking behind us and didn\u2019t see anything at first. \nI don\u2019t know what this creature or thing can be classified as, but I am 100% sure that they are real. I always regret not taking a video or picture of it, but this thing really scared the hell out of us and we all just wanted to get out of there.

I've been busy dealing with the wake of a family tragedy since then but now that things are returning to the new normal I figure it's a good time to share. I'm sorry in advanced for any formatting issues, I'm on my phone. Buckle in, this is a long one.\nFirst I'll describe the nightmare, its a very short dream and like I said it's a very clear memory just because of how scary it was. I was about four or five years old, perhaps six at most, and my twin brother and I had a bunk-bed in a room at the furthest end of the house we grew up in. The nightmare had me in my bed looking out the window to see a red sky, the kind it gets in the early dawn hours before sunrise but light still colors the sky. The next and only other thing I remember in this nightmare is that a man with crazy blue-colored eyes and a bald head appears at the window and stares right at me. The nightmare ends there but I remember just how much I screamed and screamed about it. I don't know where my brother was at the time when I woke up screaming and the only thing I can remember from when I woke up was having my mom come and get me and calm me down as she took me to her bedroom down the hall, I only remember that so we'll because I wondered where my dad was at the time. \nFast forward to this May and my father is in the hospital in the country he lives in, Colombia, and my twin brother and our older sister are staying in a hotel about a five minute walk away from the hospital he's staying in the ICU at. One night after a long day of being there for dad and for the extended family, my siblings and I return to the hotel and sit together to have a couple of beers and try to relax after all of that. We start discussing things, just trying to unwind but somehow the discussion of nightmares and dreams come up and I bring up the above story. Without missing a beat my sister straight up explains that that had really happened, that some guy really did look through my window and that she remembers the whole thing.\nMy sister, who is five years older than my brother and I, so this would make her nine to ten years old, had her bed room adjacent to the bedroom my brother and I shared. Her room faced our front lawn and street while our room faced the neighbor's house and their driveway with a very low fence between the two houses. While she didn't get into too much detail about the days before this nightmare/event, she said that she had been followed by a bald man in a truck as she rode her bike home with some friends a couple of times before. The day immediately before this nightmare was no different but the man this time actually drove right passed the house. At the time she was latchkey kid since my brother and I had to go to a special school about 45 minutes away from our hometown for a speech impediment that many twins have and my mom had to pick us up rather than be home for my sister after school, but she was never home alone for more than an hour. \nThat afternoon and evening was pretty normal as she remembers it, my dad came home from his job (he worked as a part-time cop and worked in a local hardware store) and we all had dinner, did homework, played and did usual family things before bed. That night, around 12 to 1am, this bald headed dude had parked down the street at a small industrial park and walked up to our house and tried to get in through my sister's window, which woke her up and she screamed when she saw the man nearly opening the window as it wasn't locked. My dad stormed in and tried to shove the guy out or tried to hit him with the nightstick he had, my sister doesn't remember exactly, and this caused the guy to run off but only for a short time as he came back a moment later to try and get into the window in my room. He tried opening the window but it was locked because my mom didn't want my brother and I to open it because our bed was right up against it. My sister said I screamed as loud as I could and my mom went in to get my brother and I while my dad tried to go after him by running out the front door to chase him, but to no avail as the guy hauled ass right through our back yard. The way our backyard was situated had it backed up right against a small rail yard that is a part of the aforementioned small industrial park down the street from us. Between our small neighborhood and that rail yard was a good amount of very dense trees that always made the backyards very very dark, so my dad didn't want to get attacked by him there so instead he went back inside to our house, called the police then our elderly neighbor to make sure they were okay while our mom took care of us kids. That is all my sister could remember from that night herself as this was a very long time ago.\nNeither of us could recall anything else after that either and the story just sort of stops right there. My father sadly passed away in hospital so we aren't able to ask him and given all of that none of us have thought to ask our mom yet, but maybe I will ask her soon. But for now, to the bald-headed creep who tried to do God knows what to my family, let's not meet.\nTL;DR is that my earliest memory of a nightmare turned out to be a real break in by some creep who was after my sister.", "media": null, "score": 162, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comment_count": 13, "over_18": true}, "75": {"id": "1eb4cd4", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ghosts", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "BiscuitPals", "link_flair_text": "Personal Encounter ", "time": 1722048265.9983926, "created_utc": 1721834995.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/1eb4cd4/funny_story_from_45_years_back_in_an_old_100/", "title": "Funny story from 4-5 years back in an old 100+ going on 200 year house I used to live in as a kid.", "permalink": "/r/Ghosts/comments/1eb4cd4/funny_story_from_45_years_back_in_an_old_100/", "selftext": "So for context I used to live in rural Mississippi in an old (plantation house) yikes, I know but it was cheap because nobody wanted to live in the town.
