Seconds later,\nthe object makes contact with the ground, then bouncing back to where it came from. Immediately -the internal alarm goes off and in a short time two helicopters and more than twenty Leopard and VCC armored vehicles go out to search the area of the possible impact. the search yields no results, but the nervousness of the personnel is perceptible. Twenty-six hours later a patrol of fifteen men is sent out on patrol, the group splits up, eight men go in one direction and five men, along with the officer who witnessed the start of the patrol, head towards the tank exercise area. It is just after midnight when the group noticed a red light above the turret of a tank. The group thinks it is a soldier smoking, but as they get closer they notice that the source is expanding to becoming distinct humanoid shape. The soldier asks for information but his transmitter is not working. With the memory still vivid of the previous intrusion, the officer orders the soldiers to fire their FAL machine guns in the direction of the silhouette. but when the soldiers open fire they are paralyzed and the same thing happens to the corporal with his nine caliber Beretta. The soldiers are terrified, they break into acold sweat and begin to tear up: their muscles no longer respond. After five or six minutes the humanoid silhouette shrinks back to the size of a small flame. The men recover, but they are physically destroyed. In the following days they will undergo intense specialist examinations at a military hospital in Rome (perhaps the Celio).\nSource: UFO e Alieni in Italia (Moreno Tambellini)", "media": null, "score": 388, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comment_count": 63, "over_18": false}, "10": {"id": "1dst8qf", "locked": false, "subreddit": "cryptids", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "erinbear14", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1720233714.364415, "created_utc": 1719841223.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/9cx9uvuxuw9d1.jpeg", "title": "Fresno Nightcrawler Donuts", "permalink": "/r/cryptids/comments/1dst8qf/fresno_nightcrawler_donuts/", "selftext": "Made these little guys for my true crime club", "media": null, "score": 268, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comment_count": 14, "over_18": false}, "11": {"id": "1dvlegn", "locked": false, "subreddit": "thetruthishere", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "MajesticPopcorn", "link_flair_text": "Night Terror", "time": 1720233714.666315, "created_utc": 1720139379.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1dvlegn/me_fam_the_only_night_terror_ive_had_which_my/", "title": "[ME] [FAM] The only night terror I've had, which my sister also experienced on the same night", "permalink": "/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1dvlegn/me_fam_the_only_night_terror_ive_had_which_my/", "selftext": "I hope this doesn't break the rule about dreams but there is an important element to the story that took place after the dream\nThis happened about 13 years ago. I was in my early 20s at the time.\nTo preface - while growing up, my sister and I had many encounters you could consider supernatural, her moreso than me. She seemed to be harrassed by spirits often and sometimes i shared some of those encounters\nSeveral years after moving out of home I went to visit my family and we were staying the night at my grandparents place. It was a normal day, nothing out of the ordinary. I went to bed that night, my sister and I sleeping in different rooms. I dreamt I was lying in bed (different bed in the dream, no recollection of what the room looked like) when suddenly an intense feeling of despair washed over me. But it was worse than that, like every positive feeling in the world was erased and i was left with this overwhelming pressure of all the negativity and i started crying (i also rarely ever cry). As hilarious as this example is, think of the effect the dementors from Harry Potter have on people.\nIn the dream I rolled over and a red dome had encased the bed and a black hooded figure stood at the end of the bed holding a scroll in his hand. At this point I lost it and start screaming in fear. I screamed so loud the red dome split open as I woke upself up from my own screams.\nMy step-dad came into the room and asked if that was me making noise. I just mumble \"yeah i think so\"\nThe next morning I went to tell my sister about my dream and she said, \"before you tell me that I need to tell you something that happened to me last night. I couldn't get to sleep and suddenly i noticed a person standing at the end of bed holding a piece of paper in their hand\"\nI was scared to sleep for the next few nights but nothing has happened like that since", "media": null, "score": 12, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "comment_count": 3, "over_18": false}, "12": {"id": "1dvhhwi", "locked": false, "subreddit": "letsnotmeet", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "PlutotheWanderer", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1720233715.0521708, "created_utc": 1720127583.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1dvhhwi/someone_is_sending_me_mysterious_letters_with/", "title": "Someone is sending me mysterious letters with flowers.", "permalink": "/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1dvhhwi/someone_is_sending_me_mysterious_letters_with/", "selftext": "23F if that matters.

So far all of the letters have been handwritten, or were written in Sharpie marker on a Hallmark Card.\nTwo days ago I actually received a pack of guitar picks with a gift card to a local guitar shop. The reason I knew it came from the sender was the plastic flower.\nThe creepy part about this is that my dad is not my birth father. I was adopted at 13 by my moms husband, who has been around since I was 3.\nMy birth father was an evil man that committed suicide when I was only a few months old. All of the cards are signed with his name.\nSomeone has apparently gone through the trouble of finding this information out and is sending me letters for whatever God knows reason.

It was completely black, devoid of color, except for the sub scattering high of that little flame and my light; \"he\" didn't moved at all, except when \"he\" took the lighter from what it assume was a pocket on \"him\".\ni was terrified, G was terrified and was grabbing my right arm as his life depender on it, but not matter how much we were shaking or panicking that \"man\" didn't moved, \"he\" stood still  on the trail without making any tripe of sound, so I started to saying out loud how lucky we were to bring with us our knifes in case we would hav found something dangerous.\nAt one point me and G discussed about calling our parents to take us from there and that we would have to elaborate a story so that they wouldn't be concerned, but as I turned to watch my phone G said that we still had the light so I immediately raised it on the direction of that \"man\"; I was shocked and G was frantically tapping my arm sayin \"he's not there, we get out\", and it was true: in those few seconds \"he\" got out of our vision, which of course drove us crazy and prompted us to run faster and faster in the direction from where the streets light would illuminate everything, making us feel safer.\nWe got out of the trail and that night I felt better than ever when I got under my sheets; of course I stayed with G for the rest of the evening until we arrived at his house complex (I felt so guilty and accompany G to home made me feel a little better).\nIf someone has an idea of what could have happened that night, or has a similar experience, please feel free to write in the comments, I'd really appreciate that", "media": null, "score": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "comment_count": 3, "over_18": false}, "27": {"id": "1dsyvwh", "locked": false, "subreddit": "letsnotmeet", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "SuddenAd3041", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1720233726.5490267, "created_utc": 1719855242.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1dsyvwh/at_the_bottom_of_the_hill/", "title": "At the Bottom of the Hill", "permalink": "/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1dsyvwh/at_the_bottom_of_the_hill/", "selftext": "First-time poster here. I live in a very rural area in Tennessee and this happened either the summer of 92 or 93, so I was a preteen. I can still see this in my mind like it happened yesterday.\nLike I said before, a rural area in Tennessee, where we used to have some serious issues with people dumping unwanted, worn-out items and garbage down our beautiful hillsides and ravines. \nAt that time, it was common to find illegal dumping sites everywhere because there was no bulk pickup offered by our one waste disposal monopoly.\nIn this part of the state, the economic disparity is obvious. You have some of the poorest people and some multiple mansion and vacation homes folks. \nMy family fell somewhere in the upper-middle class. Thinking Titanic we would be in either the lowest rung of first class or the very top of second class. Unfortunately, the majority would be in steerage or the coal bunker..\nWell, it was August in Tennessee, aka sun-scorching heat and enough humidity to make it slightly uncomfortable to breathe. Many describe it as the \"swamp ass capital\" of the state.\nAnyway, we had just had an extraordinarily rare murder in our county. It was all that anyone was talking about. It was all you heard in our churches and beauty salons.\nThe victim was largely unknown, a woman in her early 30s and nowhere near wealthy. I didn't know her nor did anyone. She had moved here less than a year ago and kept to herself and had not been reported missing. \nThen just before our summer break came to an end, this lady was found at the base of a steep incline, deep in one of our densely wooded areas by some folks out for a nature hike.\nThere she was, found, at the base of a large illegal dump on a winding dirt road that was barely wide enough for one vehicle. If you met another car, one of you would have to pull over so far you were almost off the road entirely.\nEven creepier? The road was named Bone Road. Yeah...\nWhen she was found, she had lost everything from the neck up, but both her upper and lower areas were recovered. Her killer had not been caught.\nSo, my mom was born and raised here and was of strong, yet, goofy stock. She has always been my best buddy, even when dropping the hammer on my brother and me. She was loved by every student she had ever taught. Our friends adored my goofy mama, often telling me how lucky I was to have her.\nMy dad was a pharmacist in our area, smarter than most, and happy to go fill a lost or forgotten prescription even late into the night.\nMy dad isn't from here but is very well-known because of his job. Everyone knows my mama because she and most of our huge family have been here since our ancestors settled here in the 1800s. The rest of her family lived in middle Tennessee.\nOn that day in August, we had been at a family reunion picnic at the beautiful, naturally-made lake we lived near.\nSuddenly, a scattered thunderstorm had popped up and brought our get-together to an end. It was just me and my mom, but on the ride home, we decided we were Sherlock Holmes and Watson. We wanted to see the crime scene. I know, brilliant.\nMy dad was at work and my brother was with a friend. This was 92 or 93, so no GPS, Alexa, Siri, or Google Earth. Not even MapQuest.\nMy dad was on our school board and had been given a highly detailed map of our entire county. Since neither of us knew how to reach Bone Road, it was agreed, the map would be our guide.\nWe went home, grabbed the map, and set out like we were Magellan.\nWe eventually found the place and headed to the spot. Being the ignorant rubber neckers we were, we just planned to drive past this stupid dump site.\nI can't explain how creepy this place was. A murder dump in the middle of BFE, on a road that started with blacktop, transitioned to gravel, and then good ol' dirt.\nIt was mid-afternoon but the sudden rain on the  August ground made the area steamy. Literal steam was emanating from the road, the fields, the woods, everywhere. That just added to the thrill of our folly.\nAs we approached the location, there was a blind curve, making it impossible to see the place until you were right up on it.\nWhen we rounded that corner, we saw we were not alone. A very dirty man had his very dirty truck pulled over at the dump, just far enough to allow us to pass.\nSure, Joe Dirt could've been just another looky lou, like us. But he gave off a creepy AF vibe. Just standing by his truck, looking down into the dump. It wasn't a sheriff's officer, we know all our local authorities and they had cleared the location a day or so before. Anyone could access the area.\nAs we squeezed past his truck, he was standing on the passenger side of our car. I'm 12 or 13, I can't drive, so he was on my side as we passed, so close to him I could see his 2-teeth clear as day. He just smiled in this uber-creeptastic, almost leering way. Not nice, not friendly.\nWe got past and thanked the Lord that Mr. 2-tooth hadn't followed us. We agreed we would reach the end of Bone Road and get the hell out of there!\nOh, you know there's a but, we reached the end of Bone Road, ending at a field. Bone Road was a dead end, no pun intended. My mom said the words I had been screaming in my head, \"OH, F*#K!\" \nWe had no choice, we had to do a 5-point turn and go back from where we came. \"Oh, I bet he's gone now,\" my mom's feeble attempt to soothe us both.\nGuess what? He was still there. Still smiling his huge 2-tooth smile. Now, as my adult self reflected on this, he could have come after us, knowing we would be cornered, but neither of us has ever been accused of being too rational.\nWe made it out unscathed, of course, and my dad hit the roof when he heard the tapestry of idiocy our afternoon adventure was.\nBut, you know there's always a but, days later, our newspaper heralded the good news! The murderer was caught.\nThe woman had been killed by a boyfriend turned stalker. She had moved here from a town about 45 minutes away to get away from him, but he found her. He just drove around with her body in his truck before happening on the dump.\nHappily ever after? Um, no. As we stared down at this guy's mugshot, it was real. Mr. 2-tooth was her killer. We never told my dad that part. Mr. 2-tooth was convicted of first-degree murder and abuse of a corpse. He will die in the state prison system, serving life with no parole. \nStill, Mom and I promised we would never be so dumb again. We still have weird adventures but not to freaky, remote murder dump sites on unknown terrain and with no one knowing where we are.  We really could have met our literal dead end. \nIt's an odd thing, knowing that you had been face-to-face with a brutal murderer, not once but twice. Well... I did have a super too-close-to-call run-in with another murderer, but that will have to be another post on another day. Oh, but Mr. 2-tooth, let's not meet. Ever.

", "permalink": "/r/bigfoot/comments/1drjxtg/encounter_in_west_alabama_around_1990/", "selftext": "The story starts off, I\u2019m either 7 or 8 years old and deer hunting with my dad in northern Choctaw county (north of Jachin, AL). \nWe\u2019re going to a bottom he found on a family friend\u2019s land that had a lot of scrapes, rubs etc.(Typical stalk hunting for the south) \nI remember it being pitch black dark (my dad never got out in the woods this early, but it was middle of rut and he was persistent) and we had to follow train tracks for about 3/4rs of a mile. You then come to a train trestle, and the bottom was about a 5-600\u2019 yards from there.\nEverything was normal (other than how early we got out there and it still being pitch black) and then once we crossed the trestle, my dad started getting a bit weird, and I thought I could hear something pacing us, just off the the tracks, maybe 5-10\u2019 into the woods. We had an old Mag light, but it was on the ass end of its batteries, and provided very little help. \nThis went on for the 1/4 mile left till the bottom, and when we got there, he was acting strange (I\u2019d been in the woods with him since I was 3, and till this day had/have seen this man scared like this). We clear out a spot (leaves and such to not make noise while we sat and hunted) and I just remember how quiet it was. No birds, squirrels running around, nothing.\nDad is still acting weird, though gets better around daybreak. When the sun comes up, everything is back to normal, no weird feelings, birds chirping, etc. \nAbout 7:15 am, all sound stops and we start hearing crashing through the woods. My dad is still visibly shaken by us being \u201cstalked\u201d and hands me his Remington 700 30-06 with a nice Bushnell scope on it, and till the day I die I\u2019ll never forget what he told me,, \u201cmy name (only for animosity) it\u2019s a big buck,, as soon as he comes out,, shoot it.\u201d \nWell ladies and gentlemen, about 150 yards down the bottom I start seeing limbs breaking and the outline of something 7-8\u2019 tall and super dark brown (my own eyes, before the scope). When I put the rifle up to my shoulder, and scope to my eye, I saw \u201cthis thing\u201d tear down a 20-25\u2019 pine, and immediately became terrified. I tried to hand the rifle back to my dad, and he just kept telling me \u201cshoot it,,, it\u2019s a big buck, shoot it.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t even look at it through the scope.\nSo this thing comes out about 75 yards from us and is huge. I\u2019m looking through the scope at what I cannot identify other than the classic description of Bigfoot, but has almost nappy, if not matted hair all over. I\u2019m relaying what I\u2019m seeing to my dad, but he just keeps telling me to shoot. \nI got the weirdest feeling (though terrified) when I got it squared in the crosshairs. It was like I was seeing something I shouldn\u2019t have seen, and at the same time was telling me not to shoot it. \nI watched it till I got chills and then dropped the rifle (got my ass chewed out by my dad for that move)and asked him to look, just freaking look, he wouldn\u2019t ..  He just kept telling me to shoot it. \nI was terrified and got up out of our spot to run and he grabbed me, and told me to shoot it one more time. I shouldered the rifle, squared it up, and once again some weird feeling came across me to the point of I\u2019d be killing a human or something, and at my age had no clue what was happening. \nAnd I begged my dad to take the gun and when I got the rifle back up,, it was gone. \nMy father and I didn\u2019t talk about this for another 30 years (he\u2019s the no nonsense type, high school football coach, etc). I brought it up at our family thanksgiving a few years ago, and had the story I told, recited in verbatim to me, and also found out it that he thought whatever it was started stalking us prior to us crossing the trestle, and he heard something hit the water when we crossed.\nWeird thing, I had nightmares for years following of \u201cthis thing\u201d somehow following me back to my house, and just watching me. Exact same everything, just barely in the woods, outside of the house I lived. \nI\u2019ve had a few weird encounters in the woods since, but nothing like this.. \nThank you for taking the time to read my story, it\u2019s taken me years to share outside my family.", "media": null, "score": 95, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comment_count": 50, "over_18": false}, "37": {"id": "1dr0n2d", "locked": false, "subreddit": "cryptozoology", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "Crunch_E_Pickle", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1720233736.626953, "created_utc": 1719627335.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cryptozoology/comments/1dr0n2d/saw_a_huge_figure_in_the_water_while_bass_fishing/", "title": "Saw a HUGE figure in the water while bass fishing.", "permalink": "/r/Cryptozoology/comments/1dr0n2d/saw_a_huge_figure_in_the_water_while_bass_fishing/", "selftext": "Location is Westchester, NY (north of NYC) in one of the massive reservoirs that they use for drinking water for NYC.

I have some anxiety issues from a stalking incident in a prior area of town so sometimes paranoia gets me but I\u2019m able to use logic to reason my way out of it 99.9% of the time. Our friend frequently travels and my mom has had health issues recently. Every person who lives here has to go outside and go through storm doors to the basement to access the laundry and we have motion sensors through the basement and yard to help us see as we\u2019re walking. My front door has a small window with a broken blind or two so there\u2019s small peepholes. All of this is relevant information. Now onto what just happened about an hour ago and I\u2019m still shaking a bit from it.\nOur housemate is traveling and my mom fell ill enough earlier I told her to go to an emergency room and make sure nothing serious was happening and I was left by myself which isn\u2019t too uncommon. I\u2019d been doing my normal routines when I remembered there was laundry in the dryer so I got up and walked down my steps into the basement since I had left the storm doors open. \n Now is where you\u2019d think the story would start but surprisingly my laundry routine went fine and I closed the storm doors and proceeded back up the stairs to my section of the home. I had to pee so the second I closed the door I placed the bin down and had the thought to lock my door tonight something I don\u2019t tend to do because my mom is a smoker and hearing the locks at night is very loud and will wake me up. I didn\u2019t which could\u2019ve been a huge mistake.\nI use the bathroom and ended up taking longer than I needed too scrolling social media. I remember all the clean clothes so I stripped mostly naked besides underwear and I throw on a pair of shorts and as I grab a shirt to throw on my heart, brain, gut, everything screams \u201cDOOR! NOW! LOCKS!\u201d\nIn that second thankfully my body responded and took the two steps towards the door tried to lock the door knob wouldn\u2019t move. That only ever happens if the knob is being turned and I know for a fact I wasn\u2019t turning it. I locked the secondary lock and slammed my back into the door waiting a minute to test the door knob lock again hoping it would work.\nThankfully this time it did and while I hadn\u2019t noticed at first the motion sensor light had activated far too long after I was inside for me to have done it. And they\u2019re such shitty lights I have to wave my hands in front of them occasionally to activate so I\u2019m 95 percent sure someone was out there. I sat with my back to the door for god knows how long before I got up and turned most of the lights of and grabbed a knife I\u2019ll have next to me all night now. I looked out both windows that face that direction after awhile and saw nothing luckily bc I don\u2019t know what I would\u2019ve done. \nTo whoever was turning the knob let\u2019s not meet.",

Only my family and close friends know my story, and I wanted to explain it fully without someone belittling my experience with the TLDR crap, thinking they\u2019re funny. \nI\u2019ve already posted this in Aliens and was advised to put it in here so if you\u2019ve already read this then I apologise. \nIt was 1997, I was 28 and my then bf and I lived in a remote village in Lincolnshire, England. He had a job where he worked from 6pm to 6am and I was working in a bar so I would take him to and from work so I could get myself to work with the one car we shared. Its probably worth mentioning that the car was brand new, it had something crazy like 18 miles on the clock when we got it, I wanted something newer than the car we had before because I didn\u2019t like the idea of being stranded down a dark country lane if the old car decided to shit itself when I was driving alone. \nI don\u2019t know how many people know Lincolnshire, but most of it is rural with thin winding roads, and the place is so flat you can see for miles. I used to drive to pick my ex up and the views in spring when the mornings were getting lighter was and still are breathtaking. So, imagine farmers fields all around you with a basic little road snaking along the edges. The fields themselves were separated in rows by not quite saplings but trees that would be a couple of years old, still thin and gangly and at this particular time of year were just starting to show hints of new leaves on their skinny branches. An absolutely beautiful drive in the lighter mornings, mainly because I was usually the only person on the road, so I could drive as slow as I liked to watch the sun coming up over the horizon. \nOk so I hope I\u2019ve described the place enough to paint an image\u2026 Here\u2019s where the story starts. So one morning I was driving along the little road, it was about 5.30am and the sun was just peaking out on the horizon and the sky was completely cloudless. I slowed down to watch it as I often did, not paying much attention to the trees as they were in a row that ran down the side of the field so they were never in the way of the view\u2026 In my peripheral I thought I saw something move amongst the skinny trees, so I stopped the car completely thinking it might be a deer or something interesting like that. \nI waited for a few seconds and nothing happened, so I was just about to restart the car when I saw two of the \u2018trees\u2019 walking out of the line up. I say trees, but I don\u2019t have a clue what they actually were. Remember this is a long time before the internet and the slenderman and all the tales and superstition etc\u2026 I was literally frozen to the spot with fear. Two tall \u2018things\u2019 walked out of the line of trees and started walking over to me. I was about 50-60 yards away from them and the only thing I could describe them as were oversized stick insects. They had two long legs and two long arms that almost touched the ground, and I\u2019d say the tallest one must have been easily 12 feet tall, the smaller one maybe 10. They walked in a fluid motion, as if they were wading through treacle, like long hair would glide through water\u2026 it was just slow and graceful. \nWhen my brain finally kicked into flight mode I started my car and glanced over to see how close they had gotten, all the while I was putting my car into gear and started it moving. The tallest one slowly lifted his arm up, like a silk scarf gliding through light wind and pointed it at me. My car instantly stalled, the dashboard warning lights were all on, all of them lit up and at the same time I got the WORST pain in my face\u2026 mainly my jaw but it made me scream out in agony and I almost blacked out. With the pain debilitating me I knew I needed to get away - fast.  I was so terrified that the car wouldn\u2019t start again  because all the lights were still on, so I turned the engine entirely off and thankfully it started again and I drove like a madwoman to get out of sight, all the time my face/jaw was burning and when I got to my ex\u2019s work he gave me a bottle of water to cool me down but it didn\u2019t do much to help, and for weeks my mouth felt like I had chewed on poison ivy, my jaw feeling like I had an abscess under each molar. \nI needed to see a dentist and I knew that but explaining what happened would have made me feel stupid so I put it off. I had three amalgam fillings, all in my lower molars and once the worst of the pain had gone - a couple of months later - I couldn\u2019t put anything metal in my mouth without getting a shock\u2026 like licking a battery shock, so I was eating with plastic cutlery all the time and decided to give in and see if the dentist would change the fillings to ceramic ones. The dentist looked in my mouth and asked what had happened to my teeth, I played it off casually and asked why. My fillings looked like little balls of mercury, so I explained the car ride etc and he said that my fillings looked like they had melted and pooled in to smooth rounded metal balls. \nEvery word of this is true, I don\u2019t mind banter or questions but please don\u2019t be mean, it\u2019s taken a lot for me to tell my story to you all.

He was 18. Importantly; there were no cars in the driveway so the house appeared to be unoccupied. My buddy is short, skinny, baby-faced and eternally looks like a middle schooler but he is a grown man who can hold his own in a fight.\nA lifted grey dually quad-cab with a spot of white primer where a company logo would have been pulls into our driveway. I don't recognize it or anyone in it. They stop and three dudes hop out of the truck, the driver has a simiautonatic in a holster on his hip. They had to drive past our \"no soliciting, no trespassing, violators may be shot\" sign to get to where they were at. I am observing this through the crack in the blinds on the living room window. \nMy buddy was around back pretending to be a blacksmith with our homemade charcoal forge. He came around the side of the house while I was observing. I couldn't hear, but I could see body language. My buddy was holding the hammer in a very specific way so that he could whip it around his shoulder and throw it like Thor if he needed to. This told me that my buddy also had no idea who these people were. \nI grabbed his deer rifle off the living room coffee table (silly place to store a gun I know) slammed a single round into the chamber and aimed through the slit in the blinds at the armed trespasser. \nJumping to my buddy's perspective, here's how their conversation went. \n\"Hey there kid, are your parents home? We're some local ranchers going door to door selling fresh cuts\" \n\"Yeah, my dad's inside getting ready to go shooting. He's got plenty of meat but my uncle might want some. Let me call him!\" To which my buddy pulled out his phone and called 911. After a moment the trespassers realized the cops were coming and got back in their truck and left. Found out later that the truck was stolen and we had had a run-in with the group that was responsible for over 30 break-ins over the past few months.

For some time they had adopted that plot of land as their favorite recreational redoubt, a quiet environment, ideal to roam at ease in the company of other friends with whom, from time to time, they would meet to kick a worn-out rubber ball to the point of satiety. That afternoon, however, the usual running buddies did not show up, so Antonio and Carlos decided to avoid any hint of boredom by immediately engaging in a game of marbles. The game kept the boys engrossed and excited for several minutes until, suddenly, Antonio noticed a sort of lump moving slowly next to a nearby house. \"In spite of the many years that have passed,\" Antonio explained to me, \"I assure you that what I experienced that afternoon is engraved in my memory for life. I lost track of Carlos a long time ago, as we both left Taboada for our parents' work. However, I am sure that he, with more reason than me, will not have forgotten it either. That afternoon we were crouching down playing marbles when, suddenly, I thought I saw out of the corner of my eye, to my right, that someone was walking, but not at ground level but higher up, as if in the air... I quickly turned my head towards the old house that was located about thirty meters to our right, and then I saw them. They were hovering over the roof of a small brick shed attached to the house. I stood up slowly and said, \"Hey, look at those guys! Without getting up, Carlos turned his head towards the shed and with astonishing serenity answered me: \"Oh, yes...! They're always around. I've seen them more than once. The truth is that the scene was most absurd; I have never seen anything like it again in my life... From the wall of that abandoned house came out, one after the other, as if in single file, some tall men, dressed as astronauts or beekeepers are dressed today, with helmets and white suits, but wearing dark boots.\nThey walked very slowly on the roof of the shed, as if in slow motion, with one arm extended forward, holding in their hand something like a lantern. That facade of the house had no doors or windows, but the guys came out of there, out of the wall itself, as if from nowhere. It was as if they materialized as they came out... And the most incredible thing is that when each one of them reached the end of the small roof where they were walking, just where the shed ended, they did not fall to the ground but suddenly disappeared and another guy came out again from the wall of the house... I did not count how many I saw, but at least ten or twelve... The thing must have lasted a little more than a minute. Then they stopped coming out of the wall, and the last one walking on the shed reached the end of the canopy and disappeared like the others. I tried to get something out of Carlos, but he only managed to tell me that he didn't know who they were. I was very surprised by his reaction to something so amazing... Well, my reaction was not more logical either, because I continued playing marbles as if nothing had happened, although I was so upset that, from time to time, I turned my eyes towards the house in case they appeared again. I remember that I didn't tell my parents anything for fear that they would forbid me to play there again; besides, I'm sure they would never have believed such a story. Did you want me to tell you the strangest thing that ever happened to me? - Antonio continued with a serious expression, \"Well, let's see who's the handsome one who believes such a thing! At least I have the consolation of knowing that it wasn't a hallucination of mine, because my friend Carlos also saw them. What I never understood was his reaction. It seemed normal to him to see those guys walking around up there; he was so cool, and we continued playing marbles as if nothing had happened. Apparently, he had already witnessed that scene on other occasions, but I assure you that he had never said anything to me.\"\nSource: Marcelino Requejo, \u201cMas Alla De Lo Sobrenatural\u201d.", "media": null, "score": 66, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comment_count": 2, "over_18": false}, "65": {"id": "1dunxfc", "locked": false, "subreddit": "cryptids", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "veal_of_children1999", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1720233761.5071194, "created_utc": 1720037385.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/uu0wy5m72dad1.jpeg", "title": "The Alabama White Thang!", "permalink": "/r/cryptids/comments/1dunxfc/the_alabama_white_thang/", "selftext": "Bipedal hominid spotted throughout the state of Alabama.

I often went to concerts, and from my house, it was only a 15 to 20-minute walk to where several music venues were located. One evening in the winter, while it was already dark, I was walking to a concert when I heard a man\u2019s voice behind me say, \"You have something on your back!\"\nI turned around to face him and simultaneously felt my back. It was a substance that smelled like cleaning detergent. It seemed like dish soap diluted with water. I found it incredibly strange. The only logical explanation I could think of was that someone in the street had thrown soap suds out the window and it had landed on my back. But if that had happened, I would have noticed something I guess?\nThe guy, somewhere in his early to mid-20s, showed the same surprise as I did and asked if it was okay for him to wipe the substance off my jacket with a handkerchief. I agreed. While he was cleaning my jacket, he asked me some general questions (name, age, study) but quickly also asked where I lived and if he could have my number. This was the moment I felt uncomfortable and said I had to go because the concert could start any moment.\nWhen I got home that evening, the substance had dried and looked like snot (sperm came to mind but I tried to get that thought out of my head) or something similar. I put the jacket in the washing machine and never thought about it again. In itself, this event wasn\u2019t that weird until a year later when EXACTLY THE SAME THING HAPPENED.\nAgain, I was walking in the dark towards a concert on the same street. Again, I heard someone shout that there was something on my jacket. I felt and smelled the same substance and when I turned around, I saw the same guy. This time I was alarmed and asked him if we didn\u2019t know each other. He said no and wanted to offer help again. I refused and quickly walked away.\nI have often wondered why but especially how he did this. A spray bottle with soap suds would only work if he was walking right behind me (both times he was at least 10-15 meters away), and you would definitely hear a spraying sound. If he used a water gun or something similar, you would probably feel it on your back. Also, while it was dark it was still very crowded since it was the citycentre of Amsterdam so it wasn't a safe spot for 'pranks'. I also hope none of the other girls (of course there had to be others) gave their personal information to him because he was obviously very weird.\nSo Mr. Clean, let's not meet again!", "media": null, "score": 38, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comment_count": 0, "over_18": true}, "67": {"id": "1dsxw4q", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ghosts", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Express_Building5627", "link_flair_text": "Is this undeniable evidence?", "time": 1720233763.2652018, "created_utc": 1719852781.0, "url": "https://v.redd.it/p9s9figbtx9d1", "title": "male voice in snore recording?? help me debunk this", "permalink": "/r/Ghosts/comments/1dsxw4q/male_voice_in_snore_recording_help_me_debunk_this/", "selftext": "This is a snore recording my roommate took a few years ago.
