A little backstory I wasn't there but according to my mother she messed with a spirit board and the house was being haunted, music boxes would start playing even knives were thrown.

Now I'm getting a really unsettling feeling when I walk oast the room at night as well as the same feeling in my room if which is next to her room. I don't have any photos and I havnt seen the shadow thing in a while but I'm worried that it might be back as I have just out of nowhere began dreading even looking into the room even with the door just slightly open, today when I open the door I heard a glass or maybe porcelain object get bumped however there isn't anything that would make that sound near the door. It could just be just childhood fears but the room just feels off to me also my dog refuses to stay in my room for more than a few hours before running out of my room. The tail at the bottom of the picture is my cat and the door at the back of the photo os my grandmother's door I always saw it going from that hallway into her room, even now I have a sense of unease in my room.

The images are sometimes vivid, but they are not consciously generated. Like I don't tell myself I'm gonna picture a specific person. The images just come to me. These are not dreams, but day-dreams/visualizations in my brain. I began receiving these vivid images more intensely only a few years ago. These visualizations I get in my brain might have something to do with my unconscious mind. The below is 100% true and the more I think about it, the weirder it is. I have had only one or two other moments with these visual images that is on this level.   \nBasically I was visiting a new large city. I was laying in bed (not sleeping or dozing off, just resting). A very vivid image came to me of a woman staring at me. She had blondish hair, was white and looked around her 20s, and also had a VERY specific feature about her that creeped me out. This is a physical feature that I cannot recall ever seeing any other person have, ever. \nThe image that came to me was just this woman's face staring at me. I felt a little bad for her and wondered if I could help her, but was also weirded out just based on the image alone. Honestly, I'm sorry if this sounds harsh, but she looked like a horror movie character. I was a little scared of this person. \nThe next day, I was taking the train. I turned around and saw this exact same person staring at me, just like the visualization I had. It looked like the same person. My reaction was to move away so she would stop looking at me, and that was that. My gut feeling was to be a little bit unnerved by this person. \nAt the time, this coincidence just felt normal, though slightly unusual. And I didn't think about it. However, on reflection, this seems very weird and difficult to explain. \nThe only possible thing I can think of that's grounded in science is that I somehow saw this person in the city before and my brain noticed them previously. However, this would have had to have been 100% unconscious, as I would swear that I never once saw that person before that day.    \nAnother possibility is the image was random and a coincidence. But due to the very unique physical feature, and person actually looking like the image that came to me, this seems unlikely. Furthermore, that was the only visual that came to me that night of anyone at all.

It was a 'private rental' (my brother would do work for the landlord to 'pay' our rent). Our landlord never came off as particularly creepy, but that could be because I rarely went outside when he came over to talk to my dad. And he wouldn't dare do anything in front of my dad.\nI was home alone one day. My dad and brothers went out (somewhere, I don't remember). I had my dog in a fenced in yard outside but that was it.\nI was in my room doing whatever I was doing, probably playing The Sims 2. We lived in the middle of nowhere and there was a long driveway which the window of my bedroom directly faced. I could see or hear anyone driving up the driveway. I saw a car (not my dad's) and immediately freaked out.\nI ran and shut all the blinds in the house, turned off all lights and checked the doors were locked. It was our landlord (he lived next door - about 2 miles from our house and yes that was the closest house). This wasn't the first time he'd come here unexpectedly. It'd happened twice before and both times I was home alone. Those first two times he was only there for 10 minutes, walking around the outside of the house and then quickly leaving. But this time was different.\nI grabbed a big kitchen knife and hid under the kitchen table. I heard him pull up outside and open our front gate. My dog outside was going crazy and barking, I heard him yell 'Shut up mutt!'. I could hear his footsteps, walking up to the door. He tried to open the front door. I was freaking out. At this point, I texted my dad. He was coming straight home but they'd be like an hour.\nHe continued to walk around the outside of our house, trying to peek into each window. The house is old and has three doors you can enter from the outside. He tried to open all three. I thought maybe he didn't know I was home. Maybe the last 2 times were a coincidence. But he started saying things, including calling out my name. He knew I was home alone.\nI couldn't hear what else he was saying through the double brick walls, but I quietly creeped through the house following his voice up and down the hallway. I was trying to hear what he was saying. That's when he said something I'll never forget.\n\"I'm going to burn the house down, but I'll let you out first!\"\nOf course I didn't take him seriously, which scares me even more. He wanted me to come out. He wanted me to take his threat seriously. That's the part that gets me. I know exactly what would have happened if I had believed him and my life would have been completely different.\nHe was there for at least 30 minutes, maybe closer to an hour. He was persistent. He left before my dad came home. I told him everything and we moved out soon after. I still don't know how he knew I was home alone. My dad never saw him on the way driving out. So he knew my dad was gone (because there was no car in the driveway) but how did he know I wasn't with him?\nThat's why, dickhead creep landlord, we'll never meet again.\nEdit: I'm just realising now we were evicted, we didn't leave.

That is my promise, and that is what will resolve any questions about 9/11, UAPs, and other contentious topics. I am personally agnostic on those issues.

There have been conflicting messages from various Members of Congress on whether this is likely to happen anytime soon. Note \u2013 a select subcommittee was formally requested on March 13th.\nReps. Moskowitz, Luna, and Burchett have repeatedly stated their intent to hold field hearings to overcome stonewalling from the Pentagon and military establishment \"I think we [Congress] should try to get into one of these places [housing UAP evidence]...and if they won't let us in I think we should have a field hearing right outside the building...and the military will have to explain why that is.\" \u2013\u00a0Rep. Moskowitz (D)\u00a0It is currently unknown when exactly we might expect that to occur, however as of Jan 12 \u2013 Rep. Luna\u00a0confirmed: \"I feel confident that we have enough evidence to move forward with our first field hearing.

Suddenly, an anthropomorphic entity appeared to one side, moved without moving its limbs, until it vanished before the absorbed gaze of the witness. After a few seconds, the aircraft folded its landing legs and took flight until it disappeared into the sky.\nJorge Roberto Herrera, the young witness, had taken a few steps closer, but noticed that he was standing on a mark on the ground, claiming that he had moved fifteen meters without being aware of having done so. When he resumed his journey, he felt indescribably ill and was admitted to a polyclinic in the city of Salta for medical attention, where he remained for several days.\nTHE TESTIMONY OF JORGE R. HERRERA\nThe episode was broadcast during the television series \u201cCita Espacial\u201d, dedicated exclusively to the UFO theme, which was broadcast on Channel 10 in Cordoba between June and September 1973, with ufologist Dr. Oscar A. Galindez as one of its regular speakers. Jorge R. Herrera appeared there to narrate his experience.\nThe following year, the magazine Cuarta Dimension, from Buenos Aires, in its N\u00b0 9, corresponding to May 1974 (pp. 21/23), published a \u201ctextual transcription\u201d of the development of the recording made to the witness[1], which we reproduce below:\n\u201cFrom the province of Salta towards Jujuy, about 20 km from the capital city of the first, I saw on the route (national 9) just 20 meters from where I was, an object that from a height of approximately ten meters, descended swinging following the direction of a leaf of the wind until it was located one meter from the ground and then fell straight down, as if in free fall.\n\u201cAll this happened without the device making any sound. It must have come from the province of Tucuman towards Jujuy. It was flying behind me and I turned around because I felt a very strange sensation. Amazed, I stopped to watch the UFO landing, which landed with seventy percent of its mass on the shoulder -very wide- and the rest on the asphalt of the road. The object had the shape of two superimposed plates and had been left slightly inclined, I estimate 20 degrees. Its diameter must have reached five meters.\n\u201cAs I don\u2019t wear a watch, I tried to calculate the time mentally. After about three minutes, some sort of legs appeared on the more inclined side, which leveled the device. What caught my attention at that moment was that until it landed, its structure seemed to be made of aluminum, but once it settled, its color changed to a dull copper.\nexplained my condition to him, and as a result I was given an injection, tests were carried out and X-rays were taken. At 12:30 I was allowed to go to bed and when I woke up at 7:00 p.m. that same evening, I found that they were giving me serum and blood. I called a nurse to ask how I was and she told me that they were going to operate on me.\n\u201cThe next day three doctors came to see me with my medical records and asked me if I had been drinking a lot, and I explained that I neither drank nor smoked, but I don\u2019t think they took my answer very seriously. Meanwhile, I was given six injections a day and took four pills. At no time did they give me any information about my health status and so, after eight days of hospitalization, I was discharged\".\n\u201cAfter three months, back in Cordoba, I went to see the doctor again. I went to the Hospital de Cl\u00ednicas and after seeing the cardiologist, he told me that everything was normal except for one small detail: my nails were blue. This caught his attention and he asked me to have a complete check-up. This general check-up took two months, after which I returned with the results to see the cardiologist again and they discovered that there was 20% of a substance in my blood (they didn\u2019t give the name) of which there should normally be only 8%.\u201d\nSOME INVESTIGATIONS ABOUT THE CASE\nThe article in question does not spare conclusions to express the verification that the force of the engines and even the radios is absorbed by the presence of a UFO. However, nothing is known in this case about the vehicles allegedly affected, nor about the identity of their drivers. The episode is limited exclusively to the testimony of a single witness, and the alleged physical or physiological \"implication\" that the contact would have had on Jorge R. Herrera.\nUntil that moment, there was apparently no clinical evidence to indicate that his experience could have been the result of a brain syndrome, temporal lobe epilepsy, metabolic disease (e.g., diabetes mellitus, uremia, etc.) or any other condition that caused any disorder. The doctors only suspected alcoholism, or perhaps other toxic agents. The article ended by reporting that the advisor Alberto M. Astorga would soon offer \u201cimportant news\u201d about the study carried out in Salta by the medical team that treated the witness. News that, in the end, was never made public (until today).\nA meeting we had with Dr. Oscar A. Galindez allowed us to access more detailed information about the case and its protagonist.\nIndeed, the incident occurred on March 13 at 11:30 a.m., when Jorge R. Herrera was walking on a sunny day on the left side of the road, from west to east, thinking of reaching the service station 5 km away, to have lunch. It was at that moment that he noticed a white aluminum object when it descended and copper when it landed and took off, about 4-5 m long by 2 m high. The witness remained static in astonishment, but felt a tingling and heat during the five minutes that his observation lasted. During the same, he suddenly saw a being of robust appearance, as if inflated, with a totally white clothing shiny like rubber and equipped with a helmet with a visor like greenish mirrored glass, without being able to notice its face due to the distance. After reaching a position 15 m from Herrera, and one metre from the object, it disappeared as suddenly as it had appeared. Then, the device took off and disappeared. Moments later, inexplicably, it found itself in front of about five footprints, of irregular appearance (in their shape and arrangement), as if the ground had been blowtorched. There it picked up a stone that it assumed had recently been fractured, that did not emit heat, and that it ended up giving away.\nAs soon as the object disappeared, Herrera felt unwell. He felt dizzy and nauseous. When he reached the bus terminal in Salta, he went to the bathroom and walked two hundred and fifty meters to the Polyclinic. He heard the sounds and noises. \u201cI feel bad,\u201d he said, \u201cI have pain everywhere and nowhere.\u201d There, they examined his pupils and gave him an intramuscular injection. They laid him down on a stretcher and some nurses quickly took him to a room, where they took off his shirt and loosened his belt. Afterwards, he woke up dressed in pajamas, while they were giving him serum and blood.

This is a bit of a long story, so bear with me.\nA few months ago, this guy started showing up at my favourite coffee shop. At first, he seemed nice enough. We had a few casual conversations, but it was clear he was interested in more than just being friends. He asked me out a couple of times, and each time I politely declined. I even mentioned that I have a girlfriend, hoping he'd get the hint.\nMy girlfriend and I have been together for three years, and we're really happy. I thought he would respect that, but instead, things took a turn for the worse.\nAfter I rejected him for the third time, I started noticing him everywhere. At first, I thought it was a coincidence, maybe we just liked the same places. But then it got weird. He'd be at the grocery store when I was shopping, at the park when my girlfriend and I were taking a walk, and even outside my apartment building. I tried to brush it off as paranoia.\nA few weeks ago, my gf and I were at the park. It was a beautiful day, and we were just enjoying each other's company. I saw the same guy in the distance, and my heart sank. I tried to ignore him. That night, I got a message on Instagram from an obviously fake account. It was a video of us at the park. With a message said something creepy like, \"Cute couple. Shame one of you is with the wrong person.\" We were both freaked out.\nI reported the account and blocked it, but videos kept coming. Different accounts, different angles. Since then I've stopped going out as much, and when I do, I always feel like I'm being watched. My gf tries to be strong for both of us, but I can tell she's scared too. We've talked about moving or calling the police but were both unsure. \nHas anyone else dealt with something like this? How did you handle it? Any advice on what we should do next? I just want to feel safe again. Thanks for reading.\nTL;DR: Rejected a guy, now I think he's stalking and recording me and my girlfriend.

They made a special trip about 90 miles to come help me sort the issue out.\nSome commenters suggested that it could have been a distant relative of my bio dad that was leaving the letters, and one suggested that it may even be my bio dad not actually dead.\nThe latter suggestion was too wild to consider personally, but I like to keep all options on the table until I can disprove it. My oldest brother was the only one who has any fluid memories of our birth dad and he said for certain that he was dead, and the story surrounding his death was too air tight to debate. Appreciate the suggestion though.\nOur first stop was the one and only flower shop, which didn\u2019t sell plastic flowers. Also they seemed surprised to have business outside of prom season. Next was a local market that has a florist. Again they don\u2019t sell plastic flowers. So I figure we would get nowhere with the flower thing.\nWe went down to the guitar store that I shop at. The pics that I received weren\u2019t sold there personally, so it would have had to more that likely be from the website of the brand. They did have three purchases of gift cards since the time lapse between receiving one and me receiving the letters. Two were paid for with a credit card, which the guy at the counter gave both names to me even though he wasn\u2019t supposed to. The other was paid in cash.\nOne of my brothers asked if it was possible to see the security camera footage of the day that the cash purchase was made, but the cashier told us that the cameras were only decoys and had no actual feed. I don\u2019t know if that was true or just an excuse not to look at the cameras.\nI had a gig on Saturday night. Both of my brothers stayed with me while I was playing, and they spent the night at our place. They said they would stay as long as they could until they figured something out. I know that\u2019s irrelevant info, but I know my bio dad was a useless piece of human garbage, but damn if I don\u2019t have the best big brothers in the world.\nSunday morning one of my brothers had noted a security camera outside one of my neighbors houses. I never saw it. He asked my neighbor if it was possible to pull the footage of the past few weeks. The man is older, like in his 70\u2019s, and seemed offended by the question. But when he explained the issue at hand, he didn\u2019t hesitate to comply. He did have to call his son to drive over to actually get the footage, but he came through with his promise and actually delivered the footage on a flash drive.\nThe man also stopped by this morning to see if I was okay and if I wanted I could sleep in their spare bedroom. He also gave me his phone number, his wife\u2019s phone number, and his sons phone number if I needed any help. Very sweet gestures that made me feel safe.\nWe looked at the footage on the flash drive, and while we didn\u2019t see much, we did see a car pull up at my mailbox and someone get out and drop something in the mailbox. We saw the same car twice, and the same person (from what we could tell) dropping something in. So we have the person on camera, as well as the type of car. There was also a driver, who wasn\u2019t the one that put anything in our mailbox.\nThere wasn\u2019t anything very visible about the person. The camera wasn\u2019t detailed enough to catch their face, and what could be see was blurry.  Also the license plate was never visible on camera.\nAll I can really say is that it\u2019s a girl that does the dropping. If it wasn\u2019t for seeing tits I wouldn\u2019t have been able to tell otherwise. And she appears to have black or very dark brown hair.\nI filed another police report with the flash drive that I submitted. We also made a copy of the footage for personally use just in case. But my neighbor is on alert now, and I\u2019m about to install my own cameras that arrived late yesterday.\nPolice reports around here don\u2019t do much, but at least it\u2019s a formal record being kept, and hopefully I can make an update with some actual grounded findings.\nPeace out everyone. Much love and stay safe.", "media": null, "score": 154, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comment_count": 25, "over_18": true}, "45": {"id": "1e0ihxf", "locked": false, "subreddit": "truecreepy", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Iguanadon2004", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1720838648.0286999, "created_utc": 1720680587.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truecreepy/comments/1e0ihxf/what_is_the_creepiest_websites_you_have_visited/", "title": "what is the creepiest websites you have visited?", "permalink": "/r/truecreepy/comments/1e0ihxf/what_is_the_creepiest_websites_you_have_visited/", "selftext": "Any website that made you feel disturbed, uncomfortable  or is downright creepy you had to leave the site?\nAny deep web sites you visited that was disturbing as well?", "media": null, "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.65, "comment_count": 19, "over_18": false}, "46": {"id": "1dwxzyr", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ghosts", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "4sincerelyyourghost", "link_flair_text": "Captured Apparition ", "time": 1720838648.537336, "created_utc": 1720295486.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1dwxzyr", "title": "Thoughts on this photo of my roommate and her cat?

If every president since the 1930s has ordered the executive branch to break the law to keep NHI contact secret, then it seems the recent ruling could be used to absolve them (and their subordinates) of their crimes. Could this absolution be exactly what is necessary to make room for true disclosure on the part of the executive branch?\nAccording to\u00a0Reuters: on July 1, 2024, the Supreme Court ruled that \u201c\u2026under our constitutional structure of separated powers, the nature of presidential power requires that a former president have some immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts during his tenure in office.\"\nReuters goes on to report that: \u201cImmunity for former presidents is \u2018absolute\u2019 with respect to their \u2018core constitutional powers,\u2019 Roberts wrote, and a former president has \u2018at least a presumptive immunity\u2019 for \u2018acts within the outer perimeter of his official responsibility,\u2019 meaning prosecutors face a high legal bar to overcome that presumption.\u201d\nOn the Joe Rogan Experience #2065\u00a0(November 21, 2023), David Grusch stated that one of the largest obstacles to disclosure was the lack of protection for those who had committed white-collar crime related UAP secrecy. He suggested that at least one prior presidential administration was advised not to disclose because litigation surrounding these crimes would reach the Supreme Court:\n\u201cI talked to some individuals that were in an informal session for a previous administration on: \u2018Should we disclose or not?\u2019 for a certain former president. And [it was] really insightful what they told me, and one of the biggest impasses to disclosure wasn't the ontological shock from a socio-economic or theological perspective, it was: \u2018Well there's some white-collar crime we violated the federal acquisition regulations. We sole sourced this work to some big companies for decades. Contractors are going to litigate this to the Supreme Court, saying they lost billions of projected income because they didn't get the bid on the work. And it's going to be this liability disaster for the US government.\u2019 And the problem with that is, is like, I understand that, but that's why you need to have a truth and reconciliation process. It's almost like the truth and reconciliation commission in post-apartheid South Africa, where people who committed like murder came in and it was like, \u2018This is what happened. Here you go.\u2019 And you know, they don't get convicted of those crimes. And I'm not saying, I mean, people who've committed murder as it relates to the subject, okay, we should probably hold them accountable. But for some of this stuff, there needs to be a process where we kind of mitigate some of those unfortunate legal issues. But that was one of the main issues: A certain group for a reasonably recent administration came up with and advised that president, \u2018Hey, look, there's going to be a lot of Supreme Court stuff. Let's not be that guy. So, it's like, \u2018That's the barrier? That's the reason? Come on.

My friend and I planned to take an early morning trail ride through Shawnee from her campground. We set out around 8am on our horses, joined by her mom's german shepherd mix. After a few hours and deep in the woods we approached a sign for a new trail that was just put in which was being talked about around camp as a difficult ride, neither of us had been on it before and we didn't want to push our older horses. The trail went up the hill and followed the bluff around to the other side and through the woods while our trail followed the creek bank. We decided to pass after reading the word \"CAUTION\" on the sign and continued around the hill to cross the creek. As we turned the corner of the hill following the trail I noticed the dog with us ran ahead through some tall grass, I assumed he was running ahead to get in the creek. While crossing the creek we hear an animal start wailing in pain. I thought it was our dog at first but he came hopping through the grass as this animal keeps screaming out. It sounded like a dog who was in IMMENSE pain, the only thing that I compare the sound to is a dog having a stroke (I work at an animal shelter so I'm around dogs a lot). As we are riding through this creek we realize the screaming is coming from up the hill which can only be reached from the new trail. My friend starts calling out to see If there are other riders on the new trail that may need help because there is no reason a dog would be that far out in the woods without a rider. No answer. We keep making our way through the creek calling out and looking to see where the sound is coming from because it was VERY close at this point, just up the bluff from where we were. We couldn't see anything and by this time we were on the other side of the creek and we're about to turn and ride away from the hill, the screaming has continued this whole time. As soon as our backs turn it stops. No more sound from the bluff at all. It didn't occur to me the possibilities until after the fact and we were really freaked out. After we reached our destination and were headed back the way we came my friend asked if we could take the new trail back because if there was an animal up there she just couldn't leave it. There was nothing, we called and whistled but didn't hear or see anything. I guess it could have been a coyote but it was probably 11:30 am to 12:30pm which isn't normally the time of day they would be out.

Harry's work deserves to be published and I'm certain that it will be referenced in the future as an incredible accumulation of truth in a sea of intentional obfuscation.\nPURPOSE OF THIS POST\nIn Joe Rogan's interview, Grusch details a meeting with Harry Reid where Grusch is briefed by Reid on the true nature and origin of AAWSAP/AATIP. During this conversation, Reid reveals to Grusch that Lockheed Martin wanted to divest itself from materials they had for decades (notice it's phrased as materials, not the entirety of a NHI tech derived portfolio).\nAccording to Grusch, it was being held at a specific facility that he knows about and provided that info to the inspector general. He then goes on to say that the CIA somehow blocked the divestiture. I believe the company that facilitated the CIA's \"takeover\" of these materials can be identified by reviewing Lockheed's corporate transactions including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, and more.\nThe company that appears to me as the most likely is called Pacific Architects and Engineers, Inc. (PAE).\nThis is post 1 and it contains my findings. Post 2 contains a itemized list of corporate transactions executed by Lockheed Martin between 2004-2011 that I put together as I formulated this post. There are many more things to be discussed in their corporate transaction history, but for now I will focus on PAE.\nAAWSAP\nGrusch: \"specifically with the Lockheed Martin stuff he (Reid) was talking about during the AAWSAP program.\"\nThe Black Vault has an extensive FOIA pull on AAWSAP.\n1) According to Grusch, AAWSAP (the parent SAP to AATIP) was created via bigoted waived SAP to facilitate the transfer of this material from Lockheed Martin to Bigelow's company.\nThis is true. But when you read the initial AAWSAP contract from 2008 it gives a bit more info about the ultimate intention.\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1wbmzbpshfbd1.png?width=632&format=png&auto=webp&s=090012923f33eaec1c962cfc1fddd653b877bb4f\nIt wasn't about Bigelow Aerospace getting a hold of anything. It was about utilizing the entity as an acquisition vehicle to eventually hand over acquired tech to the US government. They would even allow government funds to be utilized for these purchases as long as approval occurred.\nIt didn't. It was blocked according to Grusch.\n2) Grusch specifies that the $22,000,000 was going to be used to build facilities and such to receive the \"Lockheed divestment\" but it was directed to other pursuits/studies because the CIA \"blocked\" this divestment.\n$10M was provided FY08 with another $12M in FY10.\n3) A subsequent report detailed their performance was satisfactory along with basics around their accomplishments, recommendations, and funding needs.\nThis report is fun; however, I was mostly drawn to the recommendations made.\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ju9rep5bgfbd1.png?width=929&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0071c177bdc6af7888b5515c252daca976b907f\nAs I wrote in my post about Sol Foundations recent white paper on Anomalous Health Incidents (AHI), they hammer home the fact that novel biological and biotechnological advancement threats persist by treating the UAP topic with stigma.\n\nNovel biological threats\u2014whether naturally occurring, accidentally released, or deliberately engineered\u2014represent significant risks to US health and national security...\n\nI find it intriguing that this point is still being emphasized by the same cohort almost 15 years later. It must be a serious concern.\nLUE ELIZONDO'S DoD IG COMPLAINT\nElizondo filed his Department of Defense Inspector General complaint on May 03, 2021. This was 2 months before Grusch filed his. Both reference violations to Whistleblower Protection Act. The IAA FY 2022 empowered Inspector Generals to have authority to deem complaints credible and urgent, along with allowing whistleblowers to make protected disclosures outside of the direct chain of command.\nHe submitted the complaint via the Whistleblower hotline for fraud, waste, and abuse. There are far less redactions than I anticipated. My key highlight here is Lue Elizondo had no respect for Neill Tipton, even before his complaint. How do I know this?\nI've looked through all 64 pages and I can't find a single instance of Neill's name being spelled properly by Lue, he spells it with one L every single time. Neil was the DoD Director for Defense Intelligence, Collection and Special Programs. He was Lue's boss at the time. Lue even puts the classic military V/R in his emails to Niell Tipton but continues to address him as Neil.\nI don't always agree with John Greenewald's (The Black Vault) conclusions but the amount of work that team has put in is staggering. Black Vault completed a 3-hour episode deep dive of Elizondo's DoD IG complaint.\nWHAT/WHO WAS LOCKHEED TRYING TO DIVEST\nGrusch says that the CIA stopped the divestment from making its way to AAWSAP, but it's important to highlight they weren't alone. Nor would they be, they leveraged defense contractors for decades to do their dirty work.\nGrusch specifically says here:\n\nSo, Lockheed Martin wanted to divest itself from this material at a specific facility that's known to me that I provided to the Inspector General, like street address, all that shit right. And the idea was if they made a security catcher's mitt for this shit, ya know most serious SAP possible, the contractor and the other government customer, which was the central intelligence agency, for that specific Lockheed material, and it was shit they recovered from like the 50's and stuff and it was like bits and pieces like hull structure, shit like that. So, they were gonna tech transfer it and the 21 or 22 million dollars was actually for Bigelow Aerospace to build out facilities in Las Vegas\"\n\nThere are four different parties being talked about here.\n\nLockheed Martin\n\"The Contractor\"\nCentral Intelligence Agency (CIA)\nBigelow Aerospace\n\nI believe that \"The Contractor\" that may have been utilized by the CIA to receive Lockheed's divestment can be identified.\nPacific Architects and Engineers, Inc (PAE)\nLockheed acquired this business in 2006 and announced the intention to divest in 2010. Lockheed fully divested in 2011. Before I share their timeline, I'm going to detail why I believe this is the contractor that the CIA utilized to \"block\" (outbid through corporate transactions) Bigelow from getting the materials mentioned in Harry Reid's explanation of AAWSAP.\n1) Why would PAE provide cover for the CIA? Well, they have experience with that already.\nSee, initially, Pacific Architects was a subsidiary of the Pacific Corporation, a multi-national business consortium headquartered in Delaware and wholly owned by the CIA. According to SLA Investigators in the past: \"There is no such thing as not being a CIA employee if you work for Pacific Architects\".\nSo, in other words, Pacific Architects IS THE CIA.\n2) The reason given for their divestment in LMT's 2011 annual report seems like bullshit.\n\nThe divestiture of PAE was driven by a shift in customer priorities that did not align with Lockheed Martin's long-term strategic focus. Originally, PAE was acquired to serve as a gateway to new customers needing IT and systems integration services. However, as these customers evolved to require services like facility construction and physical security\u2014which were outside Lockheed Martin\u2019s strategic focus\u2014the decision was made to divest.\n\nIT and systems integration has never been PAE's business focus. Lockheed knows this, they focused on building a massive information tech portfolio for a decade and a half before they executed on the corporate takeover of Leidos (formerly SAIC) in 2016 via Reverse Morris Trust transaction.\nPAE has been in the physical security, facility construction and management, logistics, and human suffering business since their inception.\n3) Torture and interrogation? Would anyone be surprised if the CIA or adjacent private entities were found to be involved with torture? No. Lockheed entered this business as well in the early 2000s when they acquired Applied Communication Services ACS (2003) and SYTEX (2005).\nMaking Lockheed Martin a primary provider for military\u00a0interrogation services. SYTEX interrogators have been linked to\u00a0Guantanamo Bay controversies, Bagram torture and prisoner abuse,\u00a0and the\u00a0Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse\u00a0scandals. ACS was tasked with hiring those interrogators. In 2004, the\u00a0GSA\u00a0was reported to have begun investigating Lockheed's interrogation contracts.\n\n2003 -\u00a0Lockheed Martin purchases Affiliated Computer Services.\n2005 - Lockheed buys The SYTEX group (TSGI) for $440M.\n\nDuring his time with AAWSAP/AATIP, Elizondo was responsible for conducting SAP oversight at Guantanamo. This is before he suffered whistleblower reprisals by parties in his DoD IG complaint.\n4) I believe that Elizondo and UAP/NHI transparency advocates are fighting a literal war within the familiar walls of their respective organizations. According to Elizondo's 2017 performance evaluation included in his DoD IG complaint:\n\nMR Elizondo's performance was exemplary as the Director of the National Prorams Special Management Staff... His office identified and neutralized 6 insider threads, referred 2 terrorist-related criminal incidents to the FBI, addressed 9 SAP data spills, generated 6 security preliminary investigations, co-authored 4 national-level policies involving Covert Action, responded to 10 White House taskings, conducted 10 Site visits, and executed over 300 SAP indoctrinations. It cannot be overstated the importance of Mr. Elizondo's portfolio to national security and the fact that it is directly centered within the number one priority for the Obama administration and the White House.  Mr. Elizondo's efforts have led to a new understanding of terrorist operations and planning within the USG.\n\nElizondo worked with officials from the\u00a0Navy\u00a0and CIA\u00a0out of the Pentagon until October 2017, when he resigned due to internal opposition.\n5) It seems as though PAE, the international defense contractor present on all 7 continents, would know some folks over at the CIA's Office of Global Access (OGA).\n\"PAE is a leading provider of enduring support for the essential missions of the U.S. government, its allied partners and international organizations. With over 60 years of experience, PAE supports the execution of complex and critical missions by providing global logistics and stability operations, technical services and national security solutions to customers around the world. PAE\u2019s global workforce operates in over 60 countries on all seven continents and is headquartered in Arlington, Va.\nPAE's neighbors in Arlington, Virginia.\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y2sftqa1pnbd1.png?width=826&format=png&auto=webp&s=620b1dd6f800641c9144122a14e4b5e5b810e661\n6) More Tangible CIA + PAE ties exist, and they can be analyzed by evaluating a brief history of some of PAE's M&A activity, contracts awarded, correspondence with the CIA, and proven scandals and controversy that surrounds this company.\nHere's a quick one mentioned in a newswire: In 2018, Warren Stembridge, Executive VP of the intelligence business at PAE, who worked at CIA for 32 years, was awarded the\u00a0Distinguished Career Intelligence Medal\u00a0for his cumulative record of service in support of the agency\u2019s (CIA) mission.\n\nPAE's Wiki page and a summarized timeline:\n1955 - PAE is founded in California by Edward Shay\n1967 - During the\u00a0Vietnam War, PAE provided cover for the\u00a0Central Intelligence Agency's\u00a0Phoenix Program;\u00a0Colston Westbrook\u00a0was among Phoenix Program operators formally employed by PAE. PAE was also awarded the contracts for the construction of 44 Province Interrogation Centers (PICs) in\u00a0South Vietnam.\n1974 - 40% of the company is sold to an Employee Stock Ownership Program.\n1983 - This letter to William \"Bill\" Casey, the director of the CIA, is wild to me. PAE is wanting to position themselves to bid on Agency construction projects. The letter brags about the Phoenix Project and PAE's great experience and work for the agency in Vietnam, as in the Phoenix Program.\n1986 - In 1986, PAE was contracted to provide support staff to the United States Embassy in\u00a0Moscow\u00a0and Consulate General in\u00a0Leningrad.\n1988 - Edward Shay buys the shares back from the ESOP. At the same time PAE is aggressively pursuing engineering contract work with the CIA according to letters sent to CIA's Director of Administration, Raymond Huffstetler.\n1995 - Edward Shay dies and passes along company to Allen Shay.\n2000 - Since 2000, PAE has been responsible for recruiting and hiring elections observers to fill the United States quota to\u00a0OSCE\u00a0elections monitoring missions.\u00a0Under a separate contract with the U.S. State Department, PAE provided almost \"all of the logistical support for the deployment of AMIS\" beginning in 2004. In the early 21st century it also supported, via the State Department,\u00a0ECOWAS\u00a0missions in\u00a0Liberia,\u00a0Sierra Leone, and the\u00a0Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n2006 - Lockheed Martin buys PAE. The UN awards PAE a $250\u00a0million\u00a0no-bid contract\u00a0for the construction of camps for use by UN peacekeepers in the\u00a0Sudan.\n2011 - Lockheed sells PAE to Lindsay Goldberg.\n2012 - PAE awarded a $100\u00a0million contract to support the\u00a0United States Antarctic Program\u00a0for the\u00a0National Science Foundation. PAE was tasked with providing medical support, facility construction and management, and equipment and personnel transportation to sites in\u00a0Antarctica. PAE was among the top five companies in terms of value of contracts awarded by\u00a0U.S. Customs and Border Protection\u00a0(CBP).\u00a0That year its contract for developing CBP operational systems was valued at $97\u00a0million\n2015 - PAE acquires both A-T Solutions and the Global Security and Solutions Unit of US Investigations Service.\n2016 - Lindsay Goldberg sold PAE to Platinum Equity in 2016. According to PAE, since 2016 it has operated\u00a0NASA's\u00a0Stennis Space Center\u00a0and Michoud Facility as part of a joint contract with\u00a0BWX Technologies.\n2017 - PAE tasked with supplying 130 technical support personnel to the\u00a0National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Data Buoy Center. According to the company, it received a $423\u00a0million contract from the State Department to provide administrative, technical, maintenance, training, safety and logistics/procurement support for the\u00a0Colombian National Police's aviation unit.\n2018 - PAE acquires Macfadden & Associates. Warren Stembridge, executive VP of Intelligence at PAE, receives the CIA's Distinguished Career Intelligence medal for his work with the intelligence community.\n2020 - PAE listed as a publicly traded company on NASDAQ.\n2022 - PAE is sold to Amentum for $1.9B. CEO of PAE becomes CEO of Amentum. Here are some of the other components of Amentum's portfolio according to their corporate lineage graph:\nAECOM\nURS\nEG&G\nDynCorp International\nPAE\nLear Siegler Services, Inc\nWestinghouse Government Services\n\n\n2023 - PAE completes acquisition of FCi Federal.\n\nLOCKHEED'S MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS, AND DIVESTITURES\nAccording to Grusch's statements and the AAWSAP timeline, I felt it necessary to look into Lockheed Martin's M&A activity between 2004-2011. Transactions don't happen overnight, neither does \"the CIA blocked it\". What does he mean when he says the CIA blocked it? Well, I imagine it means a private contractor, with strong relationships with CIA, moved in to acquire the assets Lockheed wanted to divest.\nIn order to determine what divestitures occurred, I've reviewed the Annual Reports for investors to understand the company's performance. LMT annual reports: 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011. Because of the character count, I have to provide my cursory review of all known transactions between this time frame in a separate post.\nHowever, I have included the most important one, from my perspective. Leidos / SAIC has been a focus of mine (and others) and the LMT acquisition of Leidos (original parent company SAIC) is incredibly interesting.\n2016\nAcquisitions - Lockheed Martin acquires Leidos\n\nLeidos acquires Lockheed\u2019s Information Technology (IS&GS) business unit. The transaction included a $1.8 billion one-time special cash payment to Lockheed Martin. Lockheed Martin shareholders received 50.5% equity in Leidos.\u00a0This tax-efficient merger (by way of Reverse Morris Trust) is very interesting. I find it fascinating that this transaction was positioned as \u201cLeidos is acquiring Lockheed tech,\u201d but\u00a0Lockheed effectively acquired Leidos at the end of the day, as the transaction gave majority control to Lockheed Shareholders via\u00a0Abacus Innovations Corporations.\n\nImportant Notes About Business Transactions\n\nMergers, acquisitions, and divestitures are usually massive undertakings, especially for public companies like Lockheed. Businesses can be valued for many things, including brand and footprint, existing contracts, product portfolio, hard assets like real estate and equipment, executive team members, and more.\nThese transactions are usually meant to align with the goals of the company. But don't make the mistake of thinking a company and its goals are homogenous. From what I can tell, the Boards of these companies are fractured and in a constant state of external and internal onslaught.\nSometimes, businesses are purchased so that the acquiring company can strip the value out of them, then offload the pieces they don't need. There's an entire industry dedicated to this process and careerists who occupy board seats to aid with these transactions.\nIt's important to note that compartmentalization and stove piping occur to protect against many types of threats, both internal and external. I believe that the 10-year acceleration for disclosure is the result of serious concerns that bad actors have been successful in consolidating components of the existing UFO/NHI tech portfolio.\n\nHow Could This Coverup Be Possible?\nThe NHI/UFO coverup appears to have been so successful in persisting under a veil of secrecy due to many factors. Concerted lobbying efforts, well-crafted legislation, Board seats and relationships, and control over the appropriations/acquisitions process.\nAs I've written in this series, I believe that the NHI/UFO tech portfolio has been the subject of an ongoing war between private interests, the Intelligence Community, DoD, Exec Branch, Congress, and foreign adversaries. This is all unbelievably complex, and the info needed is not available to the public. All I can do is try to identify the shape of things.", "media": {"type": "youtube.com", "oembed": {"provider_url": "https://www.youtube.com/", "version": "1.0", "title": "UFO Whistleblower David Grusch: \"Lockheed Martin Had Access to UFO Crash Material\", Skinwalker Ranch", "type": "video", "thumbnail_width": 480, "height": 200, "width": 356, "html": "<iframe width=\"356\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OABc5bbkmSw?feature=oembed&enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen title=\"UFO Whistleblower David Grusch: &quot;Lockheed Martin Had Access to UFO Crash Material&quot;, Skinwalker Ranch\"></iframe>", "author_name": "man o' JOE", "provider_name": "YouTube", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OABc5bbkmSw/hqdefault.jpg", "thumbnail_height": 360, "author_url": "https://www.youtube.com/@man-o-Joe"}}, "score": 1246, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comment_count": 207, "over_18": false}, "65": {"id": "1e0oaw1", "locked": false, "subreddit": "aliens", "stickied": false, "category": "Aliens", "author": "Swag_Bullet", "link_flair_text": "Image \ud83d\udcf7", "time": 1720838660.3366363, "created_utc": 1720702590.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/aliens/comments/1e0oaw1/i_saw_an_alien_yesterday_and_i_havent_been_able/", "title": "I saw an alien yesterday and I haven't been able to sleep", "permalink": "/r/aliens/comments/1e0oaw1/i_saw_an_alien_yesterday_and_i_havent_been_able/", "selftext": "I was standing in my backyard in my mountain home in Upstate New York, and my backyard is enclosed by dense woodland.

So I was alone at home and I knew it. \nSo I came home and I directly went to my bedroom to continue my night but before climbing the stairs (there\u2019s 2 floors) I saw the kitchen door/window wide open. I was surprise but I didn\u2019t thought that I was in danger inside my own house. \nYou have to know that my father is super paranoiac and there\u2019s no way he could have forgot to close the windows before leaving the house for two weeks even if I stayed bc I used to sleep at my boyfriend house most of the time. But I was barely awake so I just closed the door, I checked the kitchen and the living room just to be sure and then get up to my room. There 3 rooms on the 2nd floor. \nI went to my room changed, then I went to the bathroom and get back to my room. I did close the door of my room and I don\u2019t know why because I never did. I was scrolling on my phone and like 5 minutes later, I heard step foot right behind my door. Someone was there, the whole time, while I was doing my life vulnerably. \nI was terrified. My heart stopped, i couldn\u2019t move I just took the first thing in front of me to defend myself (my babyliss). I stared at my door, waiting for the person to open up and kill me or worst. I was ready to jump out of the window and die if I had see the door opened. \nMinutes passed, and I heard the person on the stairs. I don\u2019t know how many time I stayed there, immobile, but eventually I called my boyfriend and he came rescue me. \nAt first I thought I was crazy because I didn\u2019t SEE anything and I couldn\u2019t believe that it really happens, but my boyfriend confirm that they forced the door/windows on the kitchen so they were really here. They were silently waiting for me to sleep to get out of my house. \nI was home alone, feeling safe but I was not. \nIt was traumatic, I can\u2019t barely stay alone somewhere without freaking out today. I live alone and I am constantly afraid that someone is trying to breaking in. \nBUT the \u00ab\u00a0worst\u00a0\u00bb part is that they didn\u2019t took anything.\nMy moms macbook and jewelry, my ps4, my dads gaming setup, everything was so easy to take but they didn\u2019t. I can\u2019t stop thinking that they were here for an other reason. \nYou also have to know that, at that time I was very active on Snapchat. I used to post every day, I used to tell and put on my story every part of my day. So the 5k of unknown followers that I had on social media knew everything about me at this time. And I think it may be related. \nSince then I stopped my activities on Snapchat. \nDo you think it\u2019s related or did I just interrupt them ?

One day a neighbour found him outside the door, he\u2019d tripped up the kerb and smashed his head. He helped him in and put him in a chair - and left him.
