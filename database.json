We built our house from scratch in kind of a secluded area deeper into the trees so walking to my house is unheard of, about 4 miles of highway along a strip of water, cliffs and trees just to get to my area. Nothing ever happened out there I would see deer and watch the trees blow or listen to them go back and forth with the wind. But one night I was listening to the rain and would sleep right under the window so I could get some fresh air while I slept. I could't sleep so flipped over on my stomach so I could see outside. Underneath a street light i could see what looked to be a pretty skinny dog so I thought to myself coyote (common here). Then it did something eerie to me and began to stand on its hindlegs under the streetlamp and kinda stayed there. I shivered at the sight alone but turned around to sleep and tried to not let it bother me, I was younger so that kinda stuff creeped me out. About 30 minutes later around 12:30am I toss and turn and catch a glimpse that the coyote hasnt moved an inch. Still on its hindlegs. This really had me geeked out so I closed the blinds and shut the window a little bit, closed my eyes and finally slept. I woke up around 2:30am to something idk what, but i start hearing the gravel bed outside my room shift. The sounds of something stepping on the rocks. I hear it again but a little more distinct, and remember hearing the next set to sound like its right outside my opened window and I froze up there. After a few seconds of silence I hear the footsteps go away and I end up staying there for an hour before I went back to bed. I woke up in the morning and let my dog out and checked outside my room and looked at the gravel bed. I saw two boot size footprints imbedded into the rocks facing towards my window. I go inside quickly to ask my dad if he took the dog out last night or walked into the gravel bed and he said he didn't go outside at all in the rain. I told him about the coyote but he was seemed to be more concerned with the boot prints and bought cameras that day but nothing happened after that.

I worked as an assistant at the fire department. One night, a woman called saying that she was the widow of a deceased fireman and was looking for someone to fix her grandson's computer, as he lived with her. By that time, I had already completed some IT courses and was used to receiving calls from family and friends to do tasks like that, so I took her number and told her I would call her back later. I asked a sergeant about her and mentioned the name of her deceased husband. He confirmed that she was who she said she was and that they were familiar with her calls for help like this.\nI called her back and told her I could help. I quoted her a price for the job, she agreed, and we scheduled a day to get it done.\nOn the scheduled day, I gathered the necessary equipment and went to the address she gave me. It was in the city center, which in my city means old residential buildings, as nearly all buildings there are now commercial offices. When I arrived, it really was an old building, and the bell wasn\u2019t working, as a man exiting the building told me. I waited around 30 to 40 minutes for her to answer the phone and let me in. She lived on the 5th floor, and there was no elevator, so I took the stairs. When I finally reached her floor, she opened the door quickly and let me inside.\nAs soon as I looked around, I couldn\u2019t have been more disgusted. The apartment was filthy, and the smell was unbearable. I know this might sound like I\u2019m judging her for her lower status, but since she is the widow of a fireman, she receives a pension that should be enough to take care of herself and her grandson. There were cockroaches everywhere, and I had to hold myself back from vomiting. She guided me to the computer, and as we passed the bathroom door, I noticed the bathtub looked like it had never been cleaned.\nOnce I started working on the computer, she kept talking about how lonely she was and how handsome I was. She offered me food and drinks several times, which I obviously declined. Then her grandson came into the room. He looked about 7 or 8 years old but spoke like a baby. She kept telling him how nice I was and that I was going to fix the computer. The boy asked her for a cup of milk, and she went to prepare it. During the entire time she was in the kitchen, the boy just stared at me. I tried talking to him a few times, but he didn\u2019t respond. I felt like I was in a horror movie, and I could be the victim of a murder at any moment. I\u2019m not sure why, but I didn\u2019t feel safe there.\nShe came back with the milk for the boy, and I noticed she was holding a knife in the other hand. She said she was preparing lunch and went back to the kitchen. At that point, I was sure something was going to happen to me. I quickly finished the job and called her into the room. She came in, still holding the knife, and I told her I had finished and was leaving. She insisted that her grandson needed to test it first. Since she was still holding the knife, I agreed. The boy tested the computer and told her it was faster now.\nAt that moment, she turned to me and said she didn\u2019t have the money with her. I just told her it didn\u2019t matter and that I could come back later to collect the payment. She finally let me leave, and I almost ran to the exit.

But a new report found that up to $41 billion of the bank\u2019s spending on climate finance is impossible to track.\nThe Oxfam report, titled \u201cClimate Finance Unchecked,\u201d alleges that poor record-keeping practices at the World Bank make it \u201cimpossible\u201d to verify its expenditures and impact on climate finance. The international lending institution publishes assessments of a project\u2019s budgeted spending on climate finance, not how much money is actually spent. The report estimated the difference between budgeted and actual expenditures amounted to tens of billions of dollars over six years.\nA senior World Bank official acknowledged to ICIJ that the institution should move toward calculating actual expenditures on climate finance, describing the current approach as a joint methodology used by all multilateral development banks. But the official disputed Oxfam\u2019s estimate of the variance between budgeted and actual spending, saying that the real difference was far smaller.In recent years, the World Bank has touted its spending on climate finance and its plans to dramatically expand it. World Bank President Ajay Banga said in December that the bank had met its goal to devote 35% of its financing to climate three years ahead of schedule and set a new target of 45% by 2025. That goal is well within reach; the bank announced in September that its climate finance investments reached 44% of total financing, or $42.6 billion, over the past fiscal year. \u201cWe\u2019re putting our ambition in overdrive,\u201d Banga said.\nOxfam argues that it is impossible to verify such claims without more precise and transparent accounting methods. \u201cIt is clear that no one \u2014 including the Bank \u2014 has any real idea of how many billions of dollars are going to which climate actions,\u201d the report said.\nOxfam also highlighted the lack of public information on how specific projects contribute to combating climate change. According to a separate report cited by Oxfam, more than 800 World Bank projects described as having climate finance components, nearly one-third of the bank\u2019s climate portfolio during the period examined, had little or no justification for their climate benefits. The bank also regularly publishes multiple, conflicting figures on the funds spent on a project, and many assessments of completed projects are error-ridden or simply fail to report expenditures, according to the Oxfam report.\nBy analyzing over 180 projects, Oxfam concluded that the actual expenditure on a project typically differed from budgeted amounts by 26% to 43%. It used those figures to estimate that the World Bank\u2019s claimed $104 billion in climate finance from 2017 to 2023, between $24 billion and $41 billion \u201cis effectively unaccounted for.\u201d", "media": null, "score": 5458, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comment_count": 513, "over_18": false}, "22": {"id": "1hmc3cm", "locked": false, "subreddit": "conspiracyfact", "stickied": false, "category": "Consipiracy", "author": "AnthonyofBoston", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1735354660.9017117, "created_utc": 1735170867.0, "url": "/r/u_AnthonyofBoston/comments/1hm8516/all_anthony_of_boston_papers_have_been_saved_to/", "title": "All Anthony of Boston papers have been saved to the archive.

During the night, my Nanna was laying in bed trying to sleep with my newborn uncle but had struggled to drift off due to the baby fussing. She told me that she was lay on her back with my uncle on her chest, and the room was pretty much pitch black aside from the streetlights coming in through the net curtains. She tried to drift off but then started to feel a little uneasy as though she was being watched, that sort of feeling that makes your skin prickle and hairs stand on end.\nThe next minute she heard a whistling coming from the side of the bed so she looked to her right and she said and saw a really tiny man in a suit and top hat grinning at her from the floor below. She said he seemed full of mischief and almost seemed to be mocking her and the baby by pointing at them and making a \"hand on the stomach and\" laughing motion. He then was kinda dancing around and tipping his hat and jumping from one foot to the other still laughing and pointing, and he jumped on the bed and came even closer to them and did the same motions. She remembered feeling a sense of dread, as though it was trying to get across the thought she wouldn't have the baby for very long. Or that it knew something she didn't. She was terrified and closed her eyes thinking it was some kind of hallucination due to exhaustion and ended up drifting asleep. \nMy uncle John sadly died via brain aneurysm after being beaten with a baseball bat by car thieves in 1980, and she is adamant the being knew his fate and was rubbing it in, she didn't feel it was a warning but a celebration almost. She said she constantly thought back to the little man and it gave her the creeps. She had quite a lot of paranormal experiences in general but unfortunately I've forgotten a lot of the stories she told me. It made my hairs stand on end when she told me this story for some reason. She said it was dancing like and resembled the little man from Twin Peaks, but obviously much smaller. Has anyone else experienced these kind of beings and does anyone have any insights about them? \nThanks for reading!

Because first and foremost, it's not a cryptid. Cryptids by definition are animals or creatures purported to exist, but not scientifically proven or recognized. Wendigos do not fit that criteria as they are not flesh and blood beings, but spirits demonic in nature. \nHere's the Wendigo lore: \nWendigos are malevolent spirits whose name translates to \"The evil that devours mankind.\" When a person resorts to cannibalism as a form of sustenance, whether out of desperation (like the Donner Party) or even like like Jeffrey Dahmer, that person becomes vulnerable to possession. Because they've committed the ultimate taboo. Circumstances are irrelevant. This segues into a rather easy possession by the spirit. \nBut one can become possessed by the Wendigo simply by being in a vulnerable state, be it spiritually or mentally. Even physically. Not to mention the spirit is capable of influencing people (without possessing them), breaking them down and even driving them mad, to the point where they may even commit cannibalism, which inevitably leaves them open to possession.\nWhen the person in question becomes possessed, they're driven into a state of extreme psychosis, causing them to be overcome with an insatiable hunger for human flesh. Then over time, the spirit consumes the host (specifically their soul), until there's no humanity left in the host. When this happens, and the spirit has fully taken over, the person becomes something monstrous.\nThe process of transformation is a slow burn, and incredibly painful. And it's a constant struggle to prevent the spirit from taking over. But the spirit is incredibly powerful. It not only affects the mind, but it consumes the soul (quite literally). It's caustic, corrosive. It rots the person from the inside out.\nWhen it's taken over, the person loses all traces of humanity. They become this tall, pale, emaciated and decayed... Thing that's often hunched over; with their spine protruding from their back, their teeth become sharp, yellow and crooked, their lips are tattered and bloody from autophagia (self cannibalism). Their eyes become glazed over and sunken in, their fingers become long, and bloodied (from autophagia), ending in sharp, dirty, claw-like fingernails. They also reek of death and decay. And their skin is pulled so tightly over their wiry frame, that their hearts can be seen glowing from within.\nI'm only saying this because I've been seeing recent posts that label the Wendigo as a cryptid. People may not believe in them, but that does not justify the appropriation and bastardization of the spirit. Moreover, the spirit itself is amorphous and has no definitive form. \nThat said, I hope y'all can see where I'm coming from. Or at the very least understand my stance on the subject. If anyone wants to learn about the Wendigo, I'm more than happy to share it with you in a private chat. But this is not the place for it.

I (21 F at the time) and my husband but then boyfriend (22 M at the time) and I moved into our downstairs apartment. We loved it, it was our first place that wasn\u2019t a dorm and we didn\u2019t have roommates. When we first moved in we only had one cat, but over time we ended up with two cats and a dog. \nThe way this apartment was set up was duplex style, so each building only had four apartments, two on the bottom and two on the top. We have the bottom right apartment and behind us was a cemetery. We would always joke that at least our neighbors are quiet. Well, we were wrong. \nThe first time our upstairs neighbor had an issue he stood outside of his apartment and slammed his door open and closed for 10 minutes. We could not figure out what we did wrong. Did we close a door too loudly? He wouldn\u2019t communicate with us over what the issue was, but any time we did something \u2018wrong\u2019 in his mind he would slam his door open and closed for ten minutes, shaking our whole apartment.\nThe night before I was flying out for our wedding, we spent the whole day at work and then we went to a diner for a late night meal, just trying to have a nice night as our last night together as fianc\u00e9s. We come home and I\u2019m having an anxiety attack about if I packed everything. My fiance is at the passenger side door trying to talk to me through my anxiety attack when our neighbor comes flying down the stairs yelling at us. Something about how we made noise all day and he could not believe that we are so inconsiderate of him. My fiance yells at him to \u2018f\u2019 off as he\u2019s trying to protect me. Once we get inside, my fiance goes upstairs to talk to him. We figure out it\u2019s the cat tree and every time our cat jumps on it, it hits the wall. Okay, easy enough we move the cat tree from the wall. \nOr so we think\u2026. \nWe return from our honeymoon and we think everything is good. My husband tries to befriend the neighbor as they both play online games. And my husband asks if instead of slamming the door could he message us on discord when he has an issue. He agrees, but that doesn\u2019t happen.\nI decide to call the apartment complex to let them know what happened, and they are understanding and say okay let\u2019s reach out to the property managers, who are the other upstairs apartment. The husband of the property manager team basically tells us we are making everything up because he would know if his neighbor was slamming the door for 10 minutes straight and to stop making waves. \nIt\u2019s now the end of 2021 and I have spent my time in this apartment in fear every single day. Rent was dirt cheap like 600 dollars for a one bedroom, so we were gonna tough it out. My husband gets told that he got a promotion and we are moving to the east coast! We are so excited, so he leaves and I finish packing up the apartment. I try to be the perfect neighbor now that my husband is gone. I use my earphones for everything and anything, i close stuff very slowly. I do not want to make waves. It\u2019s now a week before I start the drive across country. My friend and people from my husband\u2019s work are helping load up our UHaul box for the day. After that my friend and I decided to go into town for the rest of the day since my apartment is empty besides a bed on the ground. I drop her off at her house and then get home at 6 pm. I decide to put in my earphones and vacuum. After I vacuum I take out the trash and lock the front door as I was gonna lay down and watch TikToks. My husband was always on my case because I would often forget to lock the front door. \nI lay down with my earphones in and watch TikToks for maybe 20 minutes when i hear someone at my front door pounding on it. I know that voice\u2026 It\u2019s my upstairs neighbor. My dog is trying to crawl into my skin, meanwhile my male cat is at the window hissing at him. He is pounding on my windows now and yelling that he\u2019s gonna \u2018k\u2019 me. I call my mom who is four states away. She tells me to call 911 and not her. I\u2019m texting my husband and another friend. I\u2019m whispering to 911 that my upstairs neighbor is at my door threatening me. I then hear him trying to open up my front door. \nSince it\u2019s a small town the cops are there very quickly. They take him away and I\u2019m left in my living room with two cops. I can\u2019t speak, I just keep asking if he\u2019s gone. They assure me he\u2019s going to jail for the night.\nMy friend who lived an hour away had loaded up her husband in the car and drove to my apartment to get me. I spent the night at my friend\u2019s house that night. My mom arrived the next day and I called the apartment complex again to tell them what happened. They finally believed me, well they had no choice I sent them the police report. My mom and I start the drive to the east coast early as I wanted to close that chapter and I wasn\u2019t sleeping with the nightmares. We are in the middle of the midwest when someone from the hospital he was committed at calls me to tell me they released him, but I needed to call the cops for an order of protection because he was still threatening my life. I said I was halfway across the country, so he can\u2019t get me now. They said that was for the best given his hatred towards me. \nWe never found out what was the final straw if it was me vacuuming at 6 pm, but I never not lock the front door now. I couldn\u2019t be left alone for months. I was constantly checking to see if he had found where we moved to. In 2023 we came to a plea agreement since he moved home to his parents in Alaska that if he got mental health help, that I would drop the charges.

I'm also on mobile so that could also contribute to any mistakes. I also want to say that I know this might not sound creepy at first, or at least not as much as the other stories on this sub, but as the person who went through it the lack of knowing what she might try to do was terrifying.\nThis happened over the course of 11 months or so on and off and has to easily be the worst (and longest) encounter with a woman I've ever had in my life.\nI was on a residential (UK) trip (essentially a field trip for Americans) back in July 2022 where we spent 1 week on the trip in the woods and the 2nd week back at a community centre where we were all from. I was a college student at the time (UK college, not university for Americans, and was 17 when this happened).\nI was in a dorm with about 5 other guys and one day my friend group started talking to a girl because she revealed she went to the same college as most of us who were in the group. She liked talking to me a fair bit and this was an early sign she liked me. The next ones included how physically close she was to me during a silent disco and didn't realise I was moving away from her every time, only finding out because she exclaimed afterwards \"I was trying to dance with you but you kept moving away\". This was pretty much when I put 2 and 2 together, also because she goy us to dance at a campfire while waiting for other friends to arrive. She also snuck into the dorms with us once (her request) and on reflection this behaviour was actually kinda an early creepy sign, considering the dorms were split based on sex.\nAnyway, the end of week 2 comes and I text her asking to go out, and she replies in literally less than a minute to say yes and sends me a video of her asking to voice call immediately. I turned her down cause I'm a bit socially anxious but that was another sign of how strongly she liked me.\nEverything goes well, but on the 3rd week of us being together she started accusing me of ignoring a text she sent me while I was in class (important for later) because she said my Snapchat avatar appeared as if I read it for some reason. It was about her having some panic attack while I was in class and needing my help but again, I didn't see it because I was in class at the time. \nAs soon as I got out of class I responded and asked if she was okay and asked why I didn't respond, to which I said I was in class. She accused me of ignoring her, to which I said I didn't but she wouldn't believe me, and even got one of my other friends to text me and say to respond to her messages.\nI tell her (other friend) I was and that was the end of it with her, but my gf at the time wasn't convinced. She wouldn't let it go to the point we met in person in the college one day as privately as we could and I tried explaining it again, this time being sure to add that I would've responded had I seen it, which as I said, I did. She was calm and laughing about it a bit, and ended it with \"just respond next time\".\nGiven that we were only 3 weeks into the relationship at this point, and that she clearly didn't trust me, I decided that night to try once more to explain what happened. If she didn't listen, I decided I was done.\nTo her credit she was calm and read through all my texts about it when I explained slowly and promised I hadn't seen her text but still ended with the response of \"I just wish you hadn't ignored my text\".\nI broke up with her. I did it as calmly and gently as possible, explaining that I was still willing to be friends with her, I just didn't see us working out if she wouldn't believe me this early in the relationship because I could see the lack of trust.\nHer first response was \"you're breaking up with me? Are you serious\", again, taking into account she was the one who made a big deal out of nothing. This was past the time I planned to go to bed and stayed up until midnight having to respond to what she said. I don't remember everything she said but I can remember some included \"I guess I'll cry myself to sleep now\" and \"I can't believe I'm being broken up with over a text\". I have a video of her texts somewhere but don't want to post it here for privacy and cause it's not something I want to relive unnecessarily\nThe next day at college I walked in and she was sat at the table my friends usually sat at, something she didn't normally do. As soon as I walked through the college doors and she saw me she wouldn't break eye contact. It was creepy.\nI managed to sit with my friends again later that day cause frick that but whenever she was there she'd try to argue with me, saying stuff like I'd never get a better girlfriend than her, calling me a bottom and stuff like that. I could tell she made everyone in the group uncomfortable, and apparently she even did it so much that she said this when I wasn't even with the group enough to the point a girl I only spoke to a few times who was also on the residential had to stand up for me. Her and her bf at the time also warned me about her before I broke up with her, which was another reason I did it.\nAbout a week later she started going out with a guy from the group I was friends with and tbh everyone could tell she was just doing it to try getting back at me, even though I frankly couldn't care less since I was just glad to finally have left her. I remember when he broke up with her like a fortnight later sitting down at the table with him and he just said \"was name as aggressive with you when you broke up with her?\" to which I said \"yeah\". He shook hands with me after revealing she had the exact same reaction with him when he broke up with her as she did me. \nThe big climax, though, was one day when we were in college and she started arguing with me when I wasn't even sat on her table, I was with my friends. I'd never insulted her once at this point even though she'd done so to me countless times before and I'll admit I commented on her weight as she was storming off. However, when I did this she swung around and punched me in the side of the head. I promptly shouted at her to fuck off.\nI reported this to the college and she was given a warning. I can guarantee if I did that to her I would've been gone immediately. I did, however, get to read her report about me. It was full of lies about me supposedly being a horrible boyfriend to her (all lies) in genuinely the worst handwriting I've ever seen in my life. Thankfully the college believed me when I told them none of this had ever happened. She looked depressed around me from that point on and I admittedly couldn't keep the smile off my face, which just got her more annoyed. People in a few if my classes who heard about it made jokes but were promptly shut down when I said \"I bet you wouldn't be laughing if this was the other way around\".\nI later found out that she was also trying to start trouble with other people from my friend group and was promptly kicked out for it.\nOn top of this, in June this year I found out that she slept with a guy at the college who was known for being an extremist during the first week we were together.\nAs for me, I'm doing much better now. I'm in university now doing Film and have a great group of friends, still keep in contact with those from my old group and have a new girlfriend as of July, and are much happier together than in my previous relationship. I will add, though, that one funny thing that happened once was she looked at my Instagram story even though she doesn't follow me with a picture of me wearing my current gf's ring saying how happy we are together.
