NM, USA\nA little under 4 years ago I was working a typical shift running the register on a fairly busy food truck near a government facility. We would average 50+ customers for lunch and most were regulars, but we had a lot of new faces every day.\nOne day I get this very average looking white guy, non-descript, I couldn't pick him out in a line up. He comes to the window and asks, \"what is this?\". Unamused I tell him \"food truck, what do you want?\". He looks confused and says something along the lines of \"what do you serve on this food truck?\" I point to the sandwich board beside the window and wait. He glances at the board then asks, \"what is on a hamburger?\" like he's never heard of it before.\nI list off the regular ingredients quickly, \"burger, bun, choice of cheese, LTOP, and side of fries.\" He considers it for a moment then asks, \"what's a quesadilla?\" Some people don't know so I tell him what's in it.\nHe goes through each of the 8 or 9 items we had asking the same questions about everything. He decides on a cheeseburger and I give him the total, I think it was $12?He stares at me then hands me a $20 bill and walks away. I send the ticket to my grill and and put the change aside for when he comes back for his food. I never assume a tip unless it was mentioned as such.\nHe comes back for the food and opens the container and kinda stares at it in wonder. I offer him his change and he looks at me like he's never seen me before and walks away without his change.\nHis tone was very deliberate, like he was trying to not sound weird.

I\u2019ve had weeks of peace, with only the ping of my overactive camera system alerting me to people passing by with their dogs or children. I thought everything was fine, and maybe this isn\u2019t the most dramatic update, but it was just another scary tick mark to add to the list.\nI got an alert to activity outside the garage. Given my garage door crowbar banger that\u2019s the one I always pay most attention to honestly. I keep weird hours and hadn\u2019t been on my phone so at first thought my dad was leaving for work. \nThen I saw the recording it made instants later. This man walked boldly up to the car in the driveway (my mom\u2019s at the moment) and tried the handles of the doors before running off. I called the police with a good description and told them I have it on video, but my town doesn\u2019t have a large police force, and some of them are just like in any department: shady and lazy. \nI\u2019ve rewatched it so many times now, and he has the same build as the man I saw at the garage before. That\u2019s obviously not definitive, but now I have more details about his description I couldn\u2019t see before due to lack of lighting and cameras. \nI\u2019m still pretty shaky, even though he didn\u2019t try to get in or anything, I was outside not half an hour ago (though in the fenced backyard) I hope this isn\u2019t a lame update. It feels like it to me because still nothing is solved, and even though it might be unrelated, is that actually probable? That one person and/or their house would attract so much trouble from completely different individuals? It doesn\u2019t seem likely. \nTo the man outside my house tonight, let\u2019s never meet.\nEdited to add: this man saw the camera before he ran. I don\u2019t know if he would have tried more had he not, but it has little red and blue lights on the front part (that rotates a full circle) so even I\u2019ve noticed it. It\u2019s large and lights up a bit. That\u2019s why I thought they\u2019d deterred creeps so far. Just forgot to put that in because I don\u2019t think I\u2019m exactly in a great headspace \nSecond edit of night: was visited by the police who very kindly didn\u2019t ring the bell (parents asleep, have been texted about all of this) I gave all the evidence, and they\u2019d found the guy!!!! I don\u2019t know for absolute sure it was the same man that banged on my garage or watched from the window, but I do know that they caught this guy, and my video footage will be used I guess? Idk. I was really doubtful they\u2019d actually send someone due to the chastising text message (non emergency was closed lol, so I called the reg line) as I\u2019d mentioned in an earlier post about this incident, my dad had told me there had been a lot of car thefts in the neighborhood.\nWeirdest part to me, that I think I must just be fucking imagining, is that he looks (from the somewhat fuzzy camera stills) quite a bit like the guy I had a one night stand with a couple months ago right around when this all started. I really didn\u2019t think it could be him, but I\u2019m hoping that since I\u2019m supposed to get the ring footage to the officer tomorrow (don\u2019t have access to that one) I can ask who this person is. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s all over now, and am so thankful for those who provided me with great advice, which gave me a lot of comfort.

If something happens and I don\u2019t come back, at least I\u2019m not the only one who knows the truth.\nI started working on cruise ships a few years ago. It\u2019s definitely a strange job; you\u2019re cooped up with your co-workers 24/7 for weeks on end. People hook up, people fight. And it isn\u2019t for everyone. Some times people get off at a port and never come back. What I\u2019m saying is that I am used to the usual cruise ship weirdness. But this was different.\nI\u2019d been an AV techie for a few different ships in the Caribbean when a friend of mine suggested I check out Velorum. Their ships were really fancy, which means better equipment and better pay. So I applied and, even though I was less experienced than they were looking for, I got the gig.\nIt started off pretty normal, you know, just another job on the high seas. It was definitely stricter than other ships I\u2019d been on. Like, crew wasn\u2019t allowed on the promenade unless they were working and we\u2019re not meant to be above deck at all during our off hours. It didn\u2019t really effect me because I worked with the theatre team and was had access to pretty much every where, but you\u2019ve got to understand, weeks at sea and not being allowed topside is pretty intense for some people. So at first I took everything in stride, but looking back I should have noticed something was off from the start.\nFrom day one, there was this vibe on the ship, like everyone was keeping secrets. Certain crew members were always whispering and shoot each other these looks, like they were afraid of something. At first I thought it was just because everything was so strict, you know. Just people trying to keep their jobs. But they seemed genuinely scared of something.\nUsually these ships are like a total party for crew, but this one was just the opposite. Everyone really kept to themselves. To be honest, I thought I might just quit- it really didn\u2019t seem like the place for me. But then I met Chloe. She was a new member of the theatre team, so we got to know each other a bit during the show. I was putting her mic on and told some stupid joke about hearing her heart beat faster, but then she laughed. Pretty soon, we were spending all our free time together. Man, she was something else\u2014funny, smart, and super cute. I\u2019d had a policy not to date anyone on the ships before, but she really was different. There isn\u2019t a lot of privacy on these cruises, but we found places we could be alone. Just because we weren\u2019t allowed topside, that didn\u2019t stop us from exploring every nook and cranny of that ship.\nI\u2019d sort of forgotten about the weirdness at this point. The vibe was definitely still off, but with Chloe around I didn\u2019t really care. I didn\u2019t notice when people started disappearing. People do have a tendency to jump ship from these jobs but this was like poof, gone without a trace. All their stuff still in the cabins- passports, everything. Looking back now, it\u2019s so obvious something was up. I wished I\u2019d noticed sooner\u2026 maybe I could have done something to protect Chloe.\nSo, one of the people to go missing was Chloe's friend, Pippa. I didn\u2019t really get to know her, but most of the actors hung around together and Chloe really liked her. I know fact that she just vanished was a bit strange, but like I say, people come and go from these ships all the time so I didn\u2019t think too much about it. But Chloe was upset so I agreed to help her look into it. The really weird part was that, when we asked around, no one seemed to want to talk about it. Like, fine, people leave- but why the secrecy?\nI began to get the feeling that something was seriously messed up on that ship. Chloe and I made a plan, that we\u2019d hide some microphones in the officer\u2019s mess hall and see if we could find anything out. Looking back now I just wish we\u2019d left it alone. I set Chloe up with a few lav mics- they\u2019re small but they get good range. She was supposed to plant them in the mess and then we were going to meet in one of our secret hiding spots to see what we could hear. It was all going well at first- the officers all lust after the cast, so Chloe found it really easy to talk her way in. But then things took a turn. I think one of the officers must have noticed what Chloe was doing. They all stopped talking all of a sudden, even Chloe. Two of the mics went dead immediately, but the third one was still on. I heard someone say something I couldn\u2019t quite make out- I think Chloe must have had the mic hidden on her somewhere. But I swear it sounded like they said \u2018throw her over.\u2019\nI ran to the officer\u2019s mess, but I was too late- they were gone. I tried to follow the sounds on the mic to find her- I could hear the wind so I knew they were on deck somewhere. I must have run all over that ship. Then, suddenly, the signal went static and disappeared. Look, I\u2019ve been a sound engineer on a ship for while, I know what it sounds like when a microphone gets wet. I think they threw Chloe overboard.\nWhatever happed, she was gone. I searched the ship from top to bottom, but there was no sign of her anywhere. I reported it to my duty officer, but he totally dismissed me; said that I couldn\u2019t accept being dumped. But I knew it was something else. I knew what I\u2019d heard. A few days later I got a text message from Chloe\u2019s phone. It said that she was sorry she\u2019d left without saying anything but that she thought it was easier than going through a break up on a ship. I couldn\u2019t believe it. It really seemed like someone was covering it up now.\nI was devastated. I\u2019d only known Chloe a short time, but she was everything to me, and now she was gone, and I felt responsible. I didn\u2019t stay on the ship long after that. I knew I had to do something- I owed Chloe that much.\nSo, I went on a mission, diving head first into the dark corners of the internet, looking for anything to help me uncover the truth behind these disappearances. I\u2019d heard about something happening on another Velorum cruise ship, about the staff rebelling. That\u2019s when I found Lauren. Together we\u2019ve been piecing everything together, and I think it\u2019s bigger than we could have imagined.\nIt looks like the same people who own the cruise line have started this wellness retreat in Slovenia. I heard about it in one of the forums and I\u2019ve managed to get myself hired as their sound engineer. Like I said, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to find when I get there, but I know its not good. Hopefully Lauren and her friends can help me bring the truth to light.\nI\u2019ve got a friend running this account while I\u2019m away (thanks, Steve!), but hopefully I\u2019ll be able to give you guys a proper update when I\u2019m home. I don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to find at this festival, but I hope we get some answers, for Chloe if nothing else.

You\u2019re clearly hunting for the kind of truth that only comes from staring straight into hell\u2019s eyes. I\u2019m not here to sugarcoat or sell you bedtime stories. This is about the Shadow Weaver\u2019s Gauntlet, a trip down the darkest rabbit hole you can imagine. I survived, but don\u2019t think for a second that makes it a path worth following. \nBut hey, if you\u2019re hell-bent on ripping open the veil to the other side, be my guest. Just know, I\u2019m sharing this to save your ass, not to send you sprinting into the fire.\nBut let\u2019s talk brass tacks \u2014 the rewards, because if you\u2019re really going to dance with the devil, you better know what\u2019s up for grabs. Surviving this hellride, standing toe-to-toe with the Shadow Weaver and not blinking, it changes you. Not just mentally; I\u2019m talking about knowledge that\u2019s potent, dangerous, the kind that gives you an edge in a world that\u2019s otherwise flat and gray. We\u2019re talking secrets that could shift the balance of power, insights that could crack open the universe\u2019s silent whispers. Wealth, influence, the keys to hidden doors you didn\u2019t even know existed. But here\u2019s the kicker \u2014 it\u2019s all nothing if you can\u2019t handle the heat. This isn\u2019t winning the lottery; it\u2019s earning the right to play god, even if it\u2019s just for a moment. So, weigh your soul, measure your sanity, and be damn sure you\u2019re ready to risk it all.\nWhat\u2019s on the line? Everything. Screw up this ritual, step out of that circle, lose sight of your anchor, or get cozy with the shadows, and you\u2019re not just screwed \u2013 you\u2019re royally fucked. You crack open that door, and you\u2019re not just letting in a draft; you\u2019re rolling out the red carpet for a nightmare that doesn\u2019t know how to let go or move on.\nThe poor bastards who screw up? They\u2019re never the same. They turn into walking ghosts, haunted, eyes dead from whatever horrors clamped onto their souls. People toss around words like \u201ccrazy\u201d or \u201cbroken,\u201d but it\u2019s way worse \u2014 it\u2019s like they\u2019ve got a chunk of the Shadow Weaver\u2019s nightmare rotting right in their core.\nA lot of them, they can\u2019t handle that kind of torture. They check out early, thinking they\u2019re escaping the pain. But here\u2019s the twisted part: offing yourself doesn\u2019t cut ties with the Weaver. Hell no. You think that thing plays fair? Dying\u2019s just a one-way ticket to its home turf, a place so fucked up, our world\u2019s worst day would feel like paradise. So, yeah, there\u2019s no easy out. You botch this ritual, and you\u2019re in the Weaver\u2019s grip, here or in the beyond.\nListen, I\u2019m not here to freak you out. I\u2019m just here to hammer in the reality of what you\u2019re messing with. Think of it like juggling flames \u2013 sure, it looks badass, feels powerful, but one wrong move and you\u2019re not just nursing a burn. You\u2019re watching everything you love turn to ash. This is high stakes, no bullshit \u2013 you play this game wrong, and the fallout is on you, and it\u2019s brutal.\nIf you\u2019re reading this, chances are you\u2019re curious, maybe even tempted. Maybe you\u2019ve been dealt a few more bad hands in life than those around you, and you\u2019re looking for something beyond this world to even the odds for once in your fucking life. I was like you once, tired of seeing everyone around me fly by with half the effort, leaving me behind in the dust - always wondering what I could\u2019ve done better. Enough of living that life will make anyone turn to something as insane as this.\nHonestly, you\u2019ve got to be at rock bottom, scraping the barrel of desperation, to even think about diving into this mess. And no, there\u2019s no magic force field stopping you; it\u2019s just plain old common sense. If your life hasn\u2019t hit peak disaster, you wouldn\u2019t even dream of attempting this crap. You\u2019re there thinking, \u201cIt can\u2019t get worse, right?\u201d Wrong. Sure, the rewards sound tempting, like a shiny lure in murky waters, but mess this up, and you\u2019ll be praying for a ticket back to your previous crapfest of a life. Trust me, \u201cshitty\u201d will seem like paradise compared to the hell you\u2019ll unlock if you fuck this ritual up.\nYou need a spot dead silent, pitch black; even moonlight\u2019s pushing it. Kill all the lights, every last one. I mean, go nuts \u2014 unplug, tear out, whatever it takes. A single LED blip, and you\u2019re better off deep throating a shotgun because this thing, this ancient freak, it doesn\u2019t play with half-measures. It\u2019s old school, real old school, not fooled by our modern-day loopholes. \nAnd get this straight \u2013 you\u2019re not the exception, you\u2019re not gonna be the one to bend its will. You\u2019re not that guy pal, you\u2019re not that guy.\nNow, get your gear together: salt for your circle, a mirror, and a black candle \u2013 and I swear, if you grab a different color, you\u2019re signing your own damn death warrant. Then, matches (none of that lighter crap), something personal for your anchor (and it better mean something real), and a proper timekeeper. No digital shit. Pull out your phone and you\u2019re practically inviting it to mock you before tearing you apart. Keep it old school, or you\u2019re asking for it.\nKick things off at 11:00 PM sharp. Draw that salt circle like it\u2019s the only thing standing between you and hell \u2014 because it is. Make it big enough to fit you and all the crap you\u2019re dragging along, fear included. Drop your anchor inside; that\u2019s your lifeline, what keeps you anchored to the real world. Place the mirror outside your circle, staring right at you, and put the candle between you and your reflection, all cozy within your salt haven.\nAs midnight crawls closer, your ticker\u2019s gonna ramp up, and your head\u2019s gonna fill with every doubt it can muster. It\u2019s like your very soul\u2019s trying to slam the brakes on this whole nightmare, like it recognizes the act that you\u2019re about to perform and is doing everything in its power to prevent you from going through with it. Tough. Ignore it. Light up that candle at 11:50PM and snuff it out the moment midnight hits. What comes next is a breed of dark so thick, so suffocating, you\u2019ll swear it\u2019s alive, clawing out every speck of light from around you. That\u2019s when you know you nailed it. \nWelcome to the main event. The darkness around you? It\u2019s about to get personal, thick and heavy like it\u2019s got a grudge.\nIt\u2019s pitch-black, just you and the creeping dread. But then, if that damn candle lights up again on its own, know this: you\u2019re in deep shit.\nThat ain\u2019t no miracle or good luck; it\u2019s the Shadow Weaver playing its sick games. It\u2019s testing you, throwing down the gauntlet. If you just sit there, letting that candle burn, thinking you\u2019ve got some divine intervention on your side, you\u2019re screwed. It\u2019s not being friendly; it\u2019s laying a trap, baiting you like a fish. Light that shouldn\u2019t be there? It\u2019s a big, flashing neon sign screaming danger.\nYou kill that light as fast as you can. If you don\u2019t, if you let that candle keep burning, you\u2019re opening the floodgates to a world of torment. The darkness doesn\u2019t just stay darkness anymore; it morphs, feeds on your fear, grows thicker\nSo, rule of thumb: Candle lights up by itself? Snuff it out, ASAP. No hesitations, no second guesses. That\u2019s your lifeline to not getting dragged down into the Weaver\u2019s twisted game. Keep that flame dead until it\u2019s your time to end the game, not when the shadows decide to mess with you.\nWhile you\u2019re wrestling with the whole candle shitshow, be ready for a real mind-fuck: visions straight out of your nightmares, every screw-up you\u2019ve ever made, could start parading around like it\u2019s their goddamn debut. These aren\u2019t just bad memories; they feel real, like you\u2019re living them all over again, so much that you might forget you\u2019re stuck in this hellish ritual.\nNow listen, and listen good: Don\u2019t stare at them. Keep your eyes glued to your own reflection. Remember who the hell you are, that you\u2019re flesh and blood, not some phantom from your past. And the mirror \u2013 if you catch a glimpse of any eyes staring back that aren\u2019t yours, human or not, don\u2019t you dare lock eyes with them. That\u2019s game over, buddy. That\u2019s when you slide from \u2018fucked up night\u2019 to \u2018eternal horror movie extra\u2019.\nThe trick here? Stay selfish. It\u2019s all about you. That entity, that Shadow Weaver, it\u2019s going to pull every dirty trick to rip your attention away, to drown you in fear and doubt. But you\u2019ve got to keep your focus sharp, your eyes on your own face. This is one time being a self-centered asshole might just save you. \nThis also might be a good time to say that self centered narcissistic assholes will fare better at completing this ritual than other, more selfless individuals.\nDuring this nightmare, when you\u2019re teetering on the edge, you might hear the Shadow Weaver. This thing, it\u2019s cunning. It\u2019ll start sweet-talking you, telling you all you need to do is give in, step out of that salt circle, and all the terror, all the madness will stop. It\u2019ll promise freedom, peace, whatever it thinks will make you crack. \nIt\u2019s not just going to whisper; it\u2019s going to beg, plead, promise you everything to make you step out of that circle. It\u2019s like hearing the sweetest lie when you\u2019re desperate to believe in anything.\nBut here\u2019s the cold, hard truth: If you listen, if you break, and step out? That\u2019s it. You\u2019re done. You haven\u2019t just lost a game; you\u2019ve opened your door to a lifetime of horror.\nImagine an existence where every moment is agony, where you\u2019re endlessly torn apart and stitched back together in the dark corners of reality, a plaything for an entity with no mercy. Your soul becomes entangled in an eternal dance of suffering, a state so horrifying that the life you once knew will seem like a distant, unreachable dream.\nIt\u2019s like being trapped in a nightmare, every second of every day, without end. Your soul won\u2019t just be lost, it\u2019ll be the Shadow Weaver\u2019s plaything, subjected to unspeakable horrors, forever.\nHold your ground, remember what\u2019s at stake. The Weaver\u2019s promises are poison, its assurances are lies. Your only salvation, your only path to dawn, is to endure, to deny the darkness, and to keep your soul fiercely anchored to the light of your own resolve.\nThis ordeal, this nightmare, lasts until 3:33 AM. When the clock strikes 3:33 AM, the nightmares, the whispers, the shadows \u2013 they\u2019ll all vanish. It\u2019s not gradual; it\u2019s like someone flipped a switch, leaving behind a silence so profound it echoes.\nBut here\u2019s where they get you one last time. exhaustion will hit you like a freight train. Your bones will feel like lead, your body screams for sleep, every muscle begging for just a moment of rest. Don\u2019t fucking do it. Let me repeat it a bit louder for the folks in the back: DONT FUCKING FALL ASLEEP. \nThis is the final play, the Shadow Weaver\u2019s last chance to drag you down.\nStay awake no matter what you have to do. I can\u2019t stress this enough. If you collapse into slumber before the sun peeks its first light, before 6:00 AM rolls around, you\u2019re not just risking a bad dream. It\u2019s not about waking up groggy or with a stiff neck. No, we\u2019re talking about waking up to a life that\u2019s no longer yours, trapped in a mind shattered beyond recognition, or worse, not waking up at all. This is the Weaver\u2019s domain; in sleep, it has free reign over you, your memories, your sanity.\nHold out until dawn, keep those eyes wide open, no matter what. Because if you make it, if you push through the exhaustion and the night\u2019s horrors, the prize is there: knowledge so potent, so earth-shattering, it could rewrite history, redefine the future, or dismantle reality as we know it. Wealth, power, secrets of the universe laid bare before you.\nBut remember, this isn\u2019t a fairy tale. The scars from this night, they\u2019re not just going to fade away.\nNo amount of booze, pills, or therapy is going to scrub away what you\u2019ve seen, what you\u2019ve felt. That\u2019s the price of this so-called gift. Sure, you\u2019ll be changed, maybe even powerful, but at what cost? Just remember what you\u2019re trading in for that knowledge; remember what\u2019s clinging to your back, whispering in your ear every time the clock hits 3:33 AM.\nEvery person I\u2019ve tried to spill my guts to thinks I\u2019ve lost my damn mind. They give me those pitying glances, the ones reserved for the hopelessly insane. \nMaybe scribbling this nightmare into words is supposed to give me some sort of closure, or maybe I\u2019m just trying to offload a piece of this darkness onto someone else. I don\u2019t know.\nBut here\u2019s the straight shit: if your life is so fucked up, so utterly devoid of anything worth clinging to that you\u2019re considering calling on the Shadow Weaver, think long and hard. You better be damn sure you\u2019re ready to gamble everything \u2014 your sanity, your soul, your very existence. Because once you start this twisted game, there\u2019s no hitting pause, no second chances. You\u2019re playing for keeps against something that\u2019s been playing this game for millennia. So, I\u2019ll leave you with this \u2014 if you\u2019re desperate enough to walk this path, just remember, you might just end up wishing you hadn\u2019t. \nBecause some truths, some powers, they ain\u2019t worth the hell they drag you through.\nI\u2019ll tell you what though, dealing with the trauma is at least somewhat manageable on my super yacht with 60 crew members, that much is certain ;)", "media": null, "score": 10, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "comment_count": 13, "over_18": false}, "15": {"id": "1bbyqjq", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ghosts", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Mobile-Ad-9187", "link_flair_text": "WDYT?

I tried to show people with my terrible video editing skills, but I don't know how to sufficiently present the scale of this problem. So here's another glimpse.\nHere is Reddit's Director of Policy. I can't type out her name, because Reddit filters for mentions of her.\n\nShe is based in San Francisco, where she is Director of Policy for Reddit, the online discussion platform. In this capacity, she addresses a range of online and technology policy issues, from fake news to online terrorist recruiting. Previously, from 2015 to 2017, She served as Deputy Director for Madeleine Albright and Stephen Hadley\u2019s bipartisan Middle East Strategy Task Force at the Atlantic Council.\nShe is a term member of the Council on Foreign Relations and holds a doctorate in international relations from the University of Oxford (St. Antony\u2019s College), which she attended as a Marshall Scholar. Her doctoral research focused on ideological and bureaucratic infighting in US foreign policy toward the Middle East.\n\nAre you guys \"getting it\" yet? The never-ending infighting, the botnets stoking a cult-like atmosphere in the subreddits?\n\nHadley is also an Executive Vice Chair on the Board of Directors at the Atlantic Council and is on the Board of Directors at defense contractor Raytheon.\n\nHer last post is here\n\nFriendly reminder that Reddit hasn't published their warrant canary since 2015.\nA warrant canary is a method by which a communications service provider aims to inform its users that the provider has been served with a secret government subpoena despite legal prohibitions on revealing the existence of the subpoena. The warrant canary typically informs users that there has not been a secret subpoena as of a particular date. If the canary is not updated for the time period specified by the host or if the warning is removed, users are to assume that the host has been served with such a subpoena. The intention is to allow the provider to warn users of the existence of a subpoena passively, without disclosing to others that the government has sought or obtained access to information or records under a secret subpoena.\n\nShe became Director of Policy in June 2017\n\nThe other thing they failed to publish in 2018 was any data on foreign influence campaigns on the platform.  The 2017 report had almost 1000 accounts and tens of thousands of pieces of content.  \nThe 2018 report contained nothing.  On the issue of foreign influence, reddit's transparency has been been, horrendously bad.  Twitter has roughly the same size user base, and has to-date released over 10 million pieces of content posted by influence campaign trolls.  \nWe know foreign influence campaigns are still here, preying on us. According to one admin, they've caught 238% more influence campaign trolls last year, compared to this year!  \nBut they haven't told us at all who they were, and what they were doing.  That prevents researchers and policy makers from studying the problem of foreign influence, and it prevents all of us from understanding the ways in which we're being preyed on here on reddit.\n\nAre you seeing the web yet? I constantly share the same clip of the Guardian's investigation of Team Jorge\nBut people don't understand how many of these groups are out there. How prevalent they are in social media. \n\nThe Israeli Defense Forces\u2019 (IDF) Unit 8200 is infamous... Spying on the world\u2019s rich and famous, Unit 8200 hit the headlines last year, after the Pegasus scandal broke. Former Unit 8200 officers designed and implemented software that spied on tens of thousands of politicians and likely aided in the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\nAccording to employment website LinkedIn, there are currently at least 99 former Unit 8200 veterans currently working for Google.\nMeta \u2013 the company that owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp \u2013 has also recruited heavily from the ranks of Unit 8200.\nData from LinkedIn suggests that there are at least 166 former Unit 8200 members who went on to work for Microsoft.\nAs Israeli newspaper Haaretz noted in an investigation, \u201cIsrael has become a leading exporter of tools for spying on civilians,\u201d selling invasive surveillance software to dozens of governments, many of them among the world\u2019s worst human rights abusers. In Indonesia, for instance, the software was used to create a database of gay people.\nThe most well-known example of Israeli spyware is Pegasus, a creation of NSO Group, a technically private company staffed primarily by Unit 8200 veterans. The software was used to eavesdrop on more than 50,000 prominent people around the world. This included dozens of human rights defenders, nearly 200 journalists, several Arab royals, and over 600 politicians, including French president Emmanuel Macron, Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan and Iraqi President Barham Salih.\nPegasus works by sending a text message to a targeted device.

That's your \"gatekeeper\".\n\nHadley is also an Executive Vice Chair on the Board of Directors at the Atlantic Council and is on the Board of Directors at defense contractor Raytheon.\nRTX Corporation, formerly Raytheon Technologies Corporation, is an American multinational aerospace and defense conglomerate headquartered in Arlington, Virginia. It is one of the largest aerospace and defense manufacturers in the world by revenue and market capitalization, as well as one of the largest providers of intelligence services.\nRTX manufactures aircraft engines, avionics, aerostructures, cybersecurity solutions, guided missiles, air defense systems, satellites, and drones.\nThe company, which changed its name to RTX in July 2023, has three subsidiaries: Collins Aerospace, Pratt & Whitney, and Raytheon (formerly Raytheon Intelligence & Space and Raytheon Missiles & Defense).\nRTX's supply of weapons to Israel led to protests against the company during the 2023 Israel\u2013Hamas war. On December 14, 2023, for example, protestors blocked the entrance to an RTX facility in Arizona. In early 2024, 15 people were arrested after blocking access to RTX and BAE Systems facilities in Louisville, Kentucky in protest against supplying weapons to Israel.\n\n\nHere's a nice little collection of articles all about this particular censorship problem, all of them written by Alan Macleod.

Anywho I just came across this image and basically shit my pants. If you rounded the chin out and gave this lady a bowl cut It's basically an exact match to those two ladies in my experience. It's truly uncanny. The complexion, the odd proportions of the eyes, even the nose shape is nearly identical.   \nThose fucking eyes man\nWell I reverse searched the image and it appears it was originally produced by a photoshop artist back in 2014 or so. The earliest page i can find where the image actually appears was for a blogspot collating \"Manga style\" photography. Later iterations of it has it presented by UFO enthusiasts as a legitimate mock-up for a \"Pleiadean\". I've seen no evidence that this was the original artists intention so I'm assuming the saucer folks thought it looked close to their experiences and just slapped the label on it, go figure. \nOrigins aside, it still looks scarily similar to the ladies I saw and It's very weird that this fictitious piece of art looks so close. Now that that I have a reference point I thought it wouldn't hurt to ask if any of you here might have seen anyone strange that looked similar to this? Maybe the original artist met a similar person and that's what inspired them to make this piece?

This happened to GF's dad along with classmates, and they were sent an extremely rural, backwards area on the border of Lithuania SSR and Latvian SSR.\nSo GF's dad befriends another student sent, who actually was from this region. Instead of actually doing the labour, they instead, spend this time doing hikes, exploring, camping etc.\nOne day, they go hiking into the woods, and go deeper and deeper, it starts to get dark, and they comes across a very old homestead, lights are on inside, so they think \"Maybe was can crash here\" and they knock on the door.\nSo they knock on the door, and an old man opens the door, he said \"Oh you have arrived, i've been waiting for you\", which is a \"polite\" way of saying come in, so they enter the house, instantly they notice the house was filled with skulls, bones etc, weird, but could be hunter? But then they enter another room and there is a great feast, all set up, extremely lavishly, \"like a wedding\" according to friends dad. The vibe apparently got very weird, very quickly, the old man said for them to join the guests and eat. The friend, who was a local to the region, apparently had some idea what was happening and told them they need to leave immediately, and so they got the hell out of there.\nThat's all we know of the story so far, GF is trying to get some more information about this story. Any idea what this feast was? The general tone is that this guy was some form of old pagan \"witch\". What makes this also very interesting is that this was Soviet era, so definitely some underground thing.\nEdit: So got some more about the story from parents, the feast according to the friend, was called a ritual of \"Calling\", these events happened around September to October, and the region was called Plateliai.

For those who don't know, an amber alert goes out when a child is reported missing. If you receive notifications, you know what I'm talking about. The alert will sometimes give information like the victims appearance as well as the perpetrator, the location of the abduction, make and model of vehicle.\nMy phone started beeping one evening while helping my daughter clean her room, an amber alert. She asked about it. I gave her a small rundown and that was that. However it triggered a childhood memory I have where I believe with all my heart, that I was almost kidnapped when I was a kid. \nTo be clear, this isn't a memory that was laying dormant in my subconscious and this random amber alert and talk with my kid caused it to resurface in my mind. This incident is something I've pondered and thought about off and on for years now. I'm 41y/o male by the way. \nIt's just been a while since I've considered the factors and details of the experience and this recent amber alert and talk with my daughter really caused me to pause and reflect on the incident itself once again and here I am. As a parent you worry about these things and do all you can to protect your children especially when you personally experienced something truly scary like this. \nThe occurrence happened when I was just a young kid, my guess is around 7-8. I can't be sure but I think that's a safe estimate based on the fact that much of those early childhood memories aren't there anymore. I do remember my kindergarten experience which I would've been 5-6 and also later grades. So this incident must've happened sometime after or around the ages of 7-8.\nMy parents took me to a neighboring city to do some shopping. We lived in a small rural town with not much on offer so from time to time we would go to this neighboring city about 45 min from where we were located. It just had more to offer. They would take me up there for school clothes shopping, out to eat because restaurants were better and because my mom was a crafter. She loved to make crafts, it was her thing. There were different craft stores and a fabric store she liked going to up there.\nThis specific trip, we went to a fabric store up there, Jo Ann Fabrics to be exact. This was a pretty big store. As a little kid, I guess most every place seems big but no kidding, this was a sizable store. My dad sat out in the car while I went in with my mom. He did that a lot, sit in the car, when there was a store he just didn't want to go in so I can't blame him there. \nI can't recall exactly what all my mom was looking for or trying to get in that store that day but I do remember what section we were in, an area with a bunch of racks with various fabrics hanging. Imagine a clothing store with circular racks with clothes hanging around them and that's pretty much what it's like at this fabric store. Racks of hanging fabrics. \nI remember this area being slightly toward the beginning or entrance of the store. As my mom was looking through these racks, I begin to wander, though not far, just enough to kind of look around myself. I was probably bored and started wandering around, is my guess. But, I could still see my mom just up and over a few racks away so it wasn't like I was on the other side of the store or anything. \nA random man approached me and honestly, I can't even remember at what direction he came from. It's just like I was there by myself one minute and the next, I looked up and saw this guy. It was like he came in fast and out of nowhere. I quickly looked over to where my mom was. She had moved a few racks up and away but I could still see her. There was a fair bit of distance between my mom and me at this point. \nSo here I am standing behind some rack of fabric with this older guy, opposite me in the other side of this rack. Then he speaks, \"hey little boy, how ya doing there?\" I remained silent because this took me completely off guard. He asked, \"where's your folks at? Are you alone in here?\"\nI stood still and quiet. \"Come here, I got something to show you.\" At this point he started advancing toward me, coming around the rack to where I was. I quickly started the other way but he stopped and started coming around the other way as if to meet me in the middle. I was scared at this moment and became instantly aware that this man seemed dangerous and like he was trying to get a hold of me. \"Come here!\" he barked. I jerked fast to the left but he did the same. He had this wild look in his eyes. \nWhichever direction I went, he followed but remember, there's a rack between us. God I'm so thankful for that rack. After some back and forth movements from me and this man I finally lock in on my mom and yell, \"Mom! Help!\" You would've thought I screamed bloody murder, it was so loud but it got my mom's attention. \"What's wrong?\" she asked. This startled the man and he looked over his shoulder in the direction of my gaze and confirmed, yep that must be his mother. His demeanor completely changes and it's as if everything is just fun and games and he was just messing around and he said as much to my mom. \"I was just messing around with him.\" \"No harm ma'am.\"\nMy mom came to where I was and as we reconnected, the guy just tips his hat at my mom and makes his way out of the store. I explained to my mom what just happened, that this guy was trying to get me, I was so upset and shook up. She told me I did the right thing by yelling and getting her attention. \nIt was terrifying for sure and I'm thankful something crazy didn't happen. Could I have been imagining things like maybe this guy was really just messing around? I very much think there were nefarious intentions. Why would a random older guy be perusing a fabric store? If he was there for something like crafts or fabrics, why promptly leave when confronted? I truly believe he was up to no good. Anyway that's my story, I appreciate anyone taking the time to read.

We were exploring tunnels close to a river/ close to Fountain Creek open space.\nWhat is up everyone? So a buddy and I had a pretty strange and utterly terrifying experience. We both enjoy Urbexing and discovered a series of underground tunnels/ like storm drains, that probably went as far as a mile and a half. Anyway, we made our way to the tunnels, got our flashlights, and my camera. We were just shooting the shit and when we got maybe half way through, the tunnel narrowed to where we were hunched over instead of being able to fully stand up. We then heard a loud scream that sounded like a lady, but not human. Overall it sounded most like a mountain lion scream/ look it up. It\u2019s a terrifying sound! After we heard this, we both froze and listened. I was shining my light down the tunnel, where I saw something pale moving towards us. I probably only saw it for like 4 seconds until I broke out of my shock and my buddy and I were running hunched over in these dark tunnels. I didn\u2019t have my camera video on, but I dropped it and sure as hell will never go back to retrieve it. I thought I was hallucinating or something, but my friend saw the exact same thing. \nThe creature we saw was unlike anything i\u2019ve ever seen. It was completely pale and looked sickly/ emaciated. The body looked somewhat human, but not quite. The face resembled that of a horse/ not as big of a snout though. Really f*g strange. If I had to compare it to anything, it would be the above image. The face especially looked like that of this particular picture of the \u201cPope lick monster.\u201d It\u2019s like if you took the head of the pope lick monster photo and placed it on the body of a deer standing on its hind legs. I suck at photo editing, so perhaps someone could photoshop something like this to get a more accurate depiction of the creature? \nI still get the chills even just thinking about this experience. My friend and I vowed to never explore tunnels again (obviously). I always thought there was no such thing as humanoid creatures until I experienced this. I enjoyed listening to like Skinwalker stories, but I always thought they were pure fiction.  A deep part of me just wants to know what it is and if it was harmful? Did we escape a potentially deadly situation? Why are not more people seeing these things? There has to be more right!? Why does no one have legit photos of humanoids? If you all have an idea of what this could\u2019ve been or if you\u2019ve had a similar experience, please share! I am utterly scared and baffled.

", "permalink": "/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1bc2crp/maybe_my_ex/", "selftext": "Hi Reddit, \nFrench story, don't be rude about my english please. \nFew years ago, I was in a relationship with a guy, James (M20) during three years. \nIn the beginning, he was wonderfull. He supported me during my chemotherapy, was kind and funny, a bit crazy but not in a creepy way.\nHe helped me surviving through my sickness and I won't be alive without him right now.\nThe last year of our relationship, he changed. He wanted to try new experiences and begin taking drugs. I didn't know he was addict until our break up. \nHe was totally different. Jealous, a liar, sometimes wiched with me and he cheated on me before our break up. \nTBH, I had pity for him. So, after the break up, I've spent 6 months helping him. I was a student, he was always at my home, in pain, trying to fight his addiction. \nI said stop when, after a month in an institute, he started drugs again like 3 hours after leaving. \nSad story but it gets worst.\nDuring our relationship I choose my university to be close to him. So I had nobody's around. No friends, no family. \nOne month after cutting the rope, something strange happened. \nEverythings began with my cat. \nOn night, I went outside seing a movie. In my way home, it started raining, and I remembered that I left my cat outside. It's a really nice cat but it hates water (like every cat i guess). I started running to be home early and when I opened the door, my cat was on my sofa. \nFirst, I thought \"what a dumbass, the cat was not outside at all\" but then, I hugged him, and my cat was completely wet. \nIt feels weird. I was like \"WTF?\" and then, I thought my neighbors could have opened my door for let it in. So I just forget about it. \nOne week later, I realised that some of my clothes were missing. Particularly my underwears. I've got ADHD, so, I blamed myself for losing my own clothes. \nSame with my food and some plates, like one of my favorite bowl disappeared. It was a student's appartment so... Not big enough to lose that many things. But again, I blamed myself. I even called myself a magician, joking about how I can make everything disappear without trying. \nI loose my mind when I came back from my parent's house and discovered my place totally changed. There was the neighbors'mails on my table with a mysterious headphones, my photos on the wall were upside down and a black umbrella was on my bed. I didn't owned an umbrella. \nIt was scary af. I called my mom and then the police (yes, always mom first). The officer was nice but told me that there was nothing they can do except taking my complaint. I didn't know who was doing this to me. \nMy ex never had my keys and even when I said  that I don't want to talk to him anymore, I staid nice. I didn't thought anybody wanted to hurt me or scared me. For what? Joking? If that's it : ahah hilarious, I slept with a knife for two years, congrats. \nMy neighbors started getting scared too. We had a common basement and someone breaks the door during night. We found some supplies in it. Like a blanket and a plate (not mine btw). \nI had chaines on the inside of my door so, I felt secured when I was inside but I was scared to leave and coming back to see again my stuff missing. \nFew weeks goes by. In the evening, I had to go to the grocery store, it took me like 30 minutes. When I came back home, there was a note on my bedroom's mirror. Nothing's written, just a smiley. It freaked me out and I leave immediately. \nAgain, calling the police, they told me that I could have left the note and forget about it. I didn't have those kind of little sticky yellow paper so, I don't see how. \nI stand with my mom for a week, spend all my economies on a camera and post for help on social media because I felt totally distraught. \nAfter that, nothing. \nIn the meantime, James' sister came talk to me, saying that one of my favorite jacket was at their parent's house. I remembered wearing this jacket after saying stop to James so... Again, I've got ADHD, I might have forgot. But I didn't see James' parents for like 8 months at this time so, I found that difficult to believe. \nAlso, I suspected my neighbor who had one of my key and was feeding my cat when I wasn't home but she was in another country during most of this story so... \nI talked with James last year about that, he sweared he never done something that weird and told me he was in another cure center when all that shits happened. \nEverythings stopped after that. I still don't know who did this, neither why. \nMaybe my ex? Maybe someone else? \nNow I don't really care, but this is the creepiest story I lived. \nTo my stalker, let's not meet again.

He had been very sick and having complications from the disease.  He had his toes amputated first ,then his foot ,then the leg below the knee and two days later his leg above the knee . He was a trooper tho. A month after the final surgery he went back to his employer ( he was a truck driver ) and asked when he could come back to work . His employer said that he couldnt drive the truck . Gary told him that if he could pull himself into the truck then he could drive it . His boss said \" prove it \" . So Gary rolled his wheelchair over to the drivers side of the truck . He pulled himself into the steps ,and opened the door . Then he grabbed the rail and reached for the steering wheel and pulled himself into the cab of the truck . He then started the truck and drove away . His boss was amazed . Sorry about that I drifted.  Gary was in the hospital the last month of his life . He told his girlfriend he didnt want to die in the hospital . And somehow he convinced the doctors that he was fine and they released. 2 hours later he and his girlfriend were talking and his eyes rolled back in his head and he quietly left this world behind . Two weeks later I had a dream that Myself ,Gary ,and all our friends were camping at our local lake . Now Gary had a great sense of humor and this whole dream was in his sense of humor . It was one of the funniest dreams I've ever had . But the thing I noticed and still stands out in my mind was he wasn't  sick and he had both legs ,he was younger and the last thing he said before I woke up was \" I'm whole again and I'm all better \" . It was a great dream ,I can't  really go into details of the dream but I can tell you it was hilarious . He's ok now and he's not suffering anymore . I was at every member of his families funerals ,they're almost all gone except for his sister .

When I was 11, I met a girl who was the same age as me since sixth grade, she and I weren't the same classmates until high school but we were the same school. By the middle of sixth grade, things got creepy.\nSomehow she was everywhere every time I had an extra class, including every time I had to switch from another schedule to another schedule, my entire life I never gave my private information to her but I was half aware she knew by her own eyes even tho she was a near sight. Unfortunately, I had reported it to the teacher/faculty members but the they brushed off my warning as a ruse because I didn't have enough evidence to prove it was her, what's worse we weren't allowed to bright any electronic device (like phones for example) for pieces of evidence against her except calculator for Maths and Physic.\nThis bothered me forever, she even shared the same Home Economics class and swimming lessons as mine during the eighth grade but yet again not the same group. Even in ninth grade, she still kept following me nonstop, despite I warned her to leave me alone.\nAfter I graduated at 15, I left for a high school to start over, even though I forgot about her until the middle of October 2012...She's back! My skin turned pale as well and my heart beat like I was in panic mode. This girl, how did she even know I'm in high school that I enrolled and more importantly, I again, didn't leak my information everywhere not even to her. Once again she won't leave me alone and she starts to get worse.\nShe guilt-tripped me into 'befriending' her to let her use my belongings whether is permission or not, despite her soft manner it was a red flag to begin with that I could have avoided it sooner. On the other time, she overheard me and my classmate having a conversation about mine wanting a key charm that my classmate had. But on the next day, she attacked me after I took a seat in the class because she knew that I wanted something that she didn't, this incident caught the attention of the principal in my high school, and the principal recap the whole situation by writing a statement report, I ended up rewrite twice because of error grammar and by the third the principal made the decision, she was suspended for a week, but it wasn't enough.\nShe returned after a week and \"accused\" me of her suspending, which I wasn't involved in with her drama, even though I didn't have another choice but to report my statement for my safety. And once again, she guilt-tripped me for other reasons by hypocritically \"calling\" me for being a terrible friend, even so far she destroyed one of my belongings and supplies. I called her out but she pretended she didn't remember it, worse, she framed a student for having a torn notebook that she destroyed and yet she refused to admit her mistakes. That was my last straw as it made my blood boil, but I didn't want to show my anger as she gave me a watch in exchange for money, which turns out, she swindled and got away with it.\nIn all situations, half of my peers and teachers witnessed this incident and warned me that I should end her friendship with her, she wasn't my friend, just saw me as a pawn and manipulated me by taking advantage of my kindness and trust. We were still in the same in high school but I quietly outright not to be close with her again. That's it until early December of 2012, that was the last time I saw her, and I guess that she was expelled after the last warning from one of my peers.\nI felt relieved but I will never forget what she did to not only me but to the other half of my peers as well. By near the end of high school, it took me to realize that she was indeed not very a good friend and her attitude was sociopathic and almost creepy, and that was the reason why I ended things with her for good. Luckily I didn't give her phone number or address since that wasn't allowed in the school which I managed to avoid the red flag.\nIt's been almost 16 years since this incident took place after I finished my highschool in 2015, I'm almost 27 and currently have a job. The experience made it difficult to trust someone or befriend them again.\nSo the girl I used to befriend, let's not meet again, ever.\nEdit: I want to everyone know that the incident was happen in 2008, aka 16 years ago before 2010s and two I finished highschool since 2015 which was 9 years ago. 2020s era still confused me sometimes.", "media": null, "score": 30, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "comment_count": 7, "over_18": true}, "59": {"id": "1bcvjp3", "locked": false, "subreddit": "threekings", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "aceofhearties", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1710709125.1223729, "created_utc": 1710244888.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/threekings/comments/1bcvjp3/can_you_start_rituals_just_by_thinking_of_them/", "title": "Can you start rituals just by thinking of them?", "permalink": "/r/threekings/comments/1bcvjp3/can_you_start_rituals_just_by_thinking_of_them/", "selftext": "I\u2019m sorry I have to ask this, but for context, I have OCD and at times it\u2019s extremely dehabilitating.

How could this be possible? I found no solution. All the events that could have taken place during the four billion year period would have disrupted the system in some way. So maybe they system got help from aliens. Maybe they used technology to clean the system up. Maybe the system it\u2019s self is a techno signature. Try and find a better answer to the question of how the perfect system came to be as it is.\n\nSETI tried to find out if the system was directing a signal directly to earth. That\u2019s not going to happen and I\u2019m not sure why they think it will. SETI really hasn\u2019t looked. Funding problems and insufficient technology problems. Read the article by pressing the image at the top of the post. They are certainly excited about this system and hope to find a techno signature. Like I said maybe the system it\u2019s self is a techno signature.

On June 25, 2021, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence [55] released a 9-page redacted intelligence report, titled \u201cPreliminary Assessment: Unidentified Aerial Phenomena\u201d which assessed \u201cthe threat posed by unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) and the progress the Department ofDefense Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force has made in understanding this threat.\u201d The focus of the report was the over 120 incidents of extremely unusual aerial phenomena witnessed by Navy pilots and foreign militaries in the last two decades [56, 57].Quoting this report [55]: \u201cUAP... appeared to remain stationary in winds aloft, move against the wind, manoeuvre abruptly, or move at considerable speed, without discernible means of propulsion. In a  \n\nPage 38\nJournal of Modern Physics, Vol 10, 2024 UAP & Plasmas in the Thermosphere 38 PrePrint small number of cases, military aircraft systems processed radio frequency (RF) energy associated withUAP sightings.\u201d According to this U.S. government report [55], UAP have no visible engine or infrared exhaust plumes, but were capable of hypersonic speeds beyond \u201cthe sound barrier without a sonic boom.\u201d Many of the observations were recorded on video, including one taken by a fighter jet\u2019s camera in early 2004 that shows a whitish oval object about the size of a commercial plane, that looked like an oblong cloud but was described as a giant Tic Tac. It was flying over the ocean as pilots expressed amazement. In audio recordings of another UAP a pilot exclaims: \u201cThere\u2019s a whole fleet of them.\u201dOfficial film footage released by the U.S. government indicates that when a UAP was filmed in color, the object was \u201cwhite\u201d and gave off a bright glow and resembled a cloud (Figure 31). Yet anotherUAP is a megalithic object resembling a glowing \u201cspinning top\u201d (i.e. a \u201cflying saucer\u201d) that shifts in orientation from the right to the left (Figure 32).\n(2) (PDF) Extraterrestrial Life in the Thermosphere: Plasmas, UAP, Pre-Life, Fourth State of Matter.

You see that with dogs where you shouldn\u2019t act scared or suddenly start running away because they will immediately give chase and go after you. When you see a bear, it\u2019s the same thing. You are supposed to stand still, stand upright or slowly walk away. If you start running, they will go after you.  When you LOOK like prey, run away and act scared and intimidated, they will think you are prey and not a threat. Predator species are still leary of other animals, even smaller animals, including humans. \nMost animals, including predators, don\u2019t logically know if other animals are dangerous and so will only attack if they feel threatened or are hungry. They don\u2019t want to take a chance of attacking an animal that could be dangerous. Why try to kill an animal that could hurt them if they can just kill safe prey that won\u2019t hurt them. \nWhile a cougar COULD kill a wolf, why risk it if they can just nab a deer, instead of risking getting killed or injured by going after a wolf? From experience and the behavior of other animals, predators get a sense of what they should hunt vs taking a chance with another potential predator dangerous animal. When they see an animal flee, they see that as an indication that it\u2019s a prey species and not a fellow predator or animal they probably should mess with. \nI can see this with my own cat. If he sees a fly buzzing around, a moth, or critter that is running away, he doesn\u2019t hesitate to go after it and kill it. On THE OTHER HAND, when he sees a slow moving bug or animal (like a beetle), despite its size, he doesn\u2019t immediately attack it. He cautiously approaches it, observes it at a distance for a while, and then proceeds to \u201cplay with it\u201d but carefully poking and jabbing it with his paw to see how it reacts. It\u2019s probably instinctually where he thinks it could be potentially dangerous because it doesn\u2019t flee right away. Maybe it\u2019s poisoned or can bite back? After awhile when he sees it doesn\u2019t seem to be much of a threat and doesn\u2019t seem to be doing anything that might hurt him, and if looks like it might be injured and defenseless, he\u2019ll finally go in for the kill.\nUnless they are starving or feel threatened, predators usually leave each other but when they come in contact with each other, they don\u2019t want to look weak, like prey, and so i they will either stand their ground or gradually walk away. They don\u2019t want to fight but they also don\u2019t want to look like they are something to mess with each other.\nI imagine Bigfoot behaved the same way. They certainly have experience with other, dangerous animals, such as bears and wolves. If they come in contact with another predator, they probably hold their ground or slowly walk away to not appear scared or act like prey. \nIt\u2019s clear the \u201cPatty\u201d creature is not comfortable coming in contact with humans and is briskly leaving the area but, like other predators and humans who know how to act around dangerous animals, it gets itself out of there quickly but not too fast where it appears like scared prey. \nI\u2019m guessing Bigfoot are a very intelligent ape or human/hominin species, so it doesn\u2019t want to take a chance around humans (despite being smaller) and wants to get out there quickly but also not for like prey. Being intelligent, it might also know we have those \u201cboom-boom sticks\u201d that can kill them. \nSo Patty high tails it out if their as quickly as it can without looking like it is defenseless, weak, prey.
