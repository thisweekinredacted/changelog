He seemed really nice and was super cute, so we kept talking for awhile afterwards. We exchanged numbers and agreed to make plans later. (RED FLAG #1) He sent me 30 pictures of himself immediately after we left. I thought, that was odd.\nFlash forward, we make plans to have dinner a couple days later. He picks me up from my house (NOT A SMART IDEA). Dinner and conversation is good but he tells me an odd story. (RED FLAG #2) He said that last year he got in a shoot out with his ex-girlfriends brother. I asked him why they started shooting, he said he had no idea. I ask a few more questions about what happened and he swore that he drove to her house to drop off  things after they broke up and her brother just started shooting at him so he returned fire. So after that weird story, he says he has 2 tickets to see a soul singer we both enjoy for the following night. I agreed to go. He takes me back home and I give him a quick kiss, I pull away and he tries to kiss me again so I give him a kiss on the cheek and then pull away, he leans in for another kiss and I say good night and go inside. (RED FLAG #3) after he got home he texts me and asked \"i thought you really liked me, why didn't I get a longer kiss.\" I told him I like to take things slow and a quick kiss, is all I wanted for a first date. He proceeds to send me more pictures of himself.\nSo the next day he picks me up for the concert, it's amazing and I really enjoy the show. I let him know beforehand that I had a flight to catch at 4am the next morning, so I wouldn't be able hang out afterwards.(RED FLAG #4) While he's taking me back to my place he asks if I want to get a hotel room with him for the night, I reminded him about my flight. He then proceeds to ask me if I wanna get \"freaky\" in the car. I couldn't believe a grown man asked me that, I said no. I was actually attracted to him and could see us hooking up but I had already told him I didn't have a lot of time. Then the final straw is he ask if he can come inside. WHAT ABOUT I DON'T HAVE TIME TONIGHT DID HE NOT UNDERSTAND. At that point I knew I didn't want to see this guy again, cause i HATE saying no more than once, especially to sex. I say goodnight and go inside. About 10 minutes later, I leave out again to grab something from the store and pick something up for a neighbor. While I'm driving I hear my facetime going off, but don't answer. Once i get in the store I see he has called me 10 times in a 5 minute span. I call him back thinking I left something in his car.\nHIM: where did you go?\nME: to the store why?\nHIM: I thought you we're busy and needed to pack?\nME: I am I just needed a few things. Can i help you with something?\nHIM: it's not nice to lie. You said you we're to busy to go to the hotel, but now you're at the store.\nME:  well I don't owe you an explanation of where I need to go. I'll text you later.\nI hang up, get what I need and head back to my house. When I get back home I notice he is still parked out front. It's been about 45 MINUTES since he dropped me off by the way. I ask him if everything is okay, he shouts from his car window \nHIM: \"where did you go?\"\nME:\"I told you I went to the store. Have a good night\"\nI wave goodbye and walk my stuff inside. I'm pretty creeped out at this point but I figured he would leave. I go back out to go to my elderly neighbor. I go back outside and he's gone....OR SO I THOUGHT. I drive to my neighbors around the corner and drop her stuff off. When I go to get back in my car, I hear a car racing at full speed ahead behind. HE FOLLOWED ME THERE. He pulls right beside me rolls his window down and shouts \nHIM: \"what are you doing?\"\nME: \"why did you follow me?\"\nHIM: \"because I know this whole area! what house did you come out of.\"\nME: \"that none of your business. Please don't follow me.\"\nHIM: \"if you don't tell me what house you were in and what you were doing, I'm going to call the DEA and police and have them surround this whole block!!!\"\nME: \"what are you even talking about. Our date ended over an hour ago, you should've left\" \nHe drives away super fast. At this point I realize this guys is NUTS. I call my brother and ask him to stay on the phone with me until I get back home. When I get back to my house, he is parked out front again. My brother tells me to drive to the nearest police station. I started driving and the guy starts following me again. As I pull into the station he realizes where I went and finally drives away. I explained to an officer what happened and he offered to escort me home. When we get back to my house guess what........Mr Crazy Pants is parked out front again. He sees the officer behind me and drives away again. The officer offered to stay for a couple more hours. I didn't block Mr Crazy right away because I wanted to be aware if he says anything else scary, so I would have that for the police report. About an hour later the officer knocked on my door and made me aware that the guy was trying to sit at the corner and was probably trying to park outside my house again. The officer pulled him over and told him to leave, thankfully the officer also escorted him out of my neighborhood. After that he texts me.\nHIM: \"I see you're sneaky, I threatened to call the police on you cause you were being a sneaky liar and you called them on me? Real disrespectful. I should've called them on you first\"\nME: \"I didn't call the police, I went to the station because you we're following me.\"\nHIM: \"I was following you for my safety. You lied about where you we're going. You know what I've been through.\"\nME: \"If you weren't feeling safe, why didn't you just go home?\"\nHIM: \"why didn't you tell me where you were going?\"\nAt this point I stop responding and turn my phone off. The next morning I check my phone and he has sent me over 50 texts with memes about trust and respect. I get ready for my flight and my Uncle comes to pick me up to file a police report. After that I blocked him.\nFor the next week I had my Uncle or another male friend escort me to my house. I never saw him again but he did text me from a texting app, saying that he loved me and wanted to start over. I blocked him again and haven't heard from him since.\nThe most valuable lessons I learned was trust my instincts. I knew something was off about him so I should've never agreed on a second date. Also, NEVER EVER, let someone that you just met know where you live or your address, especially if its a first date. I always follow that rule but I let my guard down this time, against better judgement and I could've been harmed.\nGUY WHO Threatened TO CALL THE POLICE ON ME FOR NOT HAVING SEX WITH YOU....LET'S NOT MEET AGAIN.", "media": null, "score": 271, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comment_count": 42, "over_18": true}, "13": {"id": "1d96ds8", "locked": false, "subreddit": "threekings", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "AM1119", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1717814568.8555543, "created_utc": 1717636890.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/threekings/comments/1d96ds8/what_would_happen_if_i_put_my_blood_on_a_ouija/", "title": "What would happen if I put my blood on a ouija board and played it, how dangerous is it?", "permalink": "/r/threekings/comments/1d96ds8/what_would_happen_if_i_put_my_blood_on_a_ouija/", "selftext": "Ive", "media": null, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "comment_count": 6, "over_18": false}, "14": {"id": "1d9zxzu", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ghosts", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Witch_Ever", "link_flair_text": "Personal Encounter ", "time": 1717814569.1205184, "created_utc": 1717727210.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1d9zxzu", "title": "My dog acts like someone is scratching her ears in the middle of the night or in broad daylight. 300 yr old chair rocks, but stops if you look directly at it.

I was joking with my family, my parents were a bit ahead of me in the sidewalk; in the opposite direction, a young man was approaching us, wearing a gray hoodie with the zipper up, the hood pulled over his head, and his hands buried in the front pockets. \nHe walked briskly, his head down, ignoring us. As he passed by me, I peeked under the shadow of his hood. I couldn\u2019t have seen him for more than a second or two, but the sensation I felt stretches the memory and has scarred it into my brain. I was struck by the deepest panic I have ever experienced, a fear so complete that when I had to describe it, I called it primordial, the feeling that my entire human being had encoded to fear him. As if he had been a predator forever, a danger since the beginning of time. His face is giving me goosebumps all over my back and behind my ears even now as I describe it almost ten years later. \nI cannot describe him as anything other than a man who evolved from rats instead of apes; he was completely covered in tawny, glossy fur like that of beavers, with a long, downward-bent nose ending in a rat\u2019s snout without whiskers, and his tiny eyes, like marbles, were entirely black. I have never managed to find anything online that resembled what I saw, only one image that has helped me to describe him at this moment remotely resembles him. If I can, I will try to link it.\nI remember being gripped by the most intense shiver of pure terror, I turned to look at him as he passed me, gasping, my mouth open. I waited for him to walk away and told my family what I had seen, stammering. I have no way to prove I saw him and convince the skeptics, except for the goosebumps on my arms, the hair standing up on my head, and the chills down my back at this moment. It wasn\u2019t fear: fear comes and goes.

I live in the Central Arkansas area for reference. My buddy's grandparents own some farmland about 15-20 minutes outside of our town, and we would regularly spend the night out there on weekends with some of our other friends. Making a fire, drinking, etc. This particular weekend was just him and I.\nIt was pretty dark by the time we got there, but it was the standard fare. We had decided to set up a fire on the dirt path that ran from my friends' grandparents house, through their field to the woods. We built the fire closer to the middle of the field.\nNot long after we get the fire started, we sit down and get some music going and crack open our first beers. He turns off the music and notices something in the sky behind me (my back was facing the woods), and I turn to look. There was a bright light in sky above the treeline. I wasn't too weirded out by this, and neither was he. However, I had never seen a star that bright before. I opened up this stargazer app on my phone that I had had forever thinking that we were close to a planet, but before I could even point my phone in that direction, the star moved.\nAt this point we both froze. The light moved quickly and smoothly to the right, without any bobs or waves, and was utterly silent. I noticed that the light was coming from some kind of flying vehicle and was actually much closer than we thought; it was probably 300-400 feet away flying above the woods. This thing was also fast, too fast to move that quietly without making some sort of noise. It was dark and I couldn't make out what exactly the vehicle was, and the bright light emitting from its side sort of obscured any good look. It moved perfectly parallel with the treeline, just right above it. It was like it had left when it noticed that we had noticed it. We continued watching as the \"UFO\" just quickly and quietly moved on in a straight line until it was beyond our sight a few seconds later.\nWe just sort of looked at each other like \"what the fuck?\", and began to discuss what we just saw, sort of in hushed tones like we were dreaming. Twenty minutes or so later, we hear a noise coming from the sky and see two loud ass planes flying side by side, going exactly the direction that the \"UFO\" had gone. At this point we started to think that it was a military drone of some kind, and we didn't see or hear anything else that night. I still think about it every now and then, and decided to post this looking for some opinions.\nWhat do y'all think it could have been?

I had recently lost a lot of weight and needed to save money for skin removal surgery, in addition to buying all new clothing and seeing a chiropractor because of the changes in my gait effecting my spine (pro tip: losing weight is expensive as fuck, idk why nobody warns you about that). \nSo this was a Friday night, and I was in a college town near the state university with a lot of bars and restaurants. Because all of my clothes hung off of my body like a tablecloth, I was wearing a decorative scarf tied into a dress, and it was a little on the revealing side, but didn\u2019t look as sloppy as the rest of my clothing. If you don\u2019t wear decent clothing and makeup and such when you street perform, people assume you\u2019re homeless and can be really shitty towards you. This is relevant to the story. \nSo I was tuning up my guitar, sitting in a camping chair outside of a couple of bars, and at around 8:30pm this beige SUV pulls up and parks in front of me. The guy driving it hopped out and approached me. \nHim: hey, do you want something to eat?\nMe: nah I\u2019m ok, thanks though!\nHim: okay.\nAnd he got back into his car. But instead of driving away, he just sat there, staring at me.\nI thought it was a little bit strange at the time, but I was focused on getting warmed up, so I didn\u2019t initially worry about it too much. I was only planning on staying out until about midnight, so I wanted to maximize my time. It was the end-of-dinner-time, beginning-of-bar-time rush, so it took me a while to realize the beige SUV was still there, and the guy was still sitting in the drivers seat, looking at me. I\u2019m pretty sure he didn\u2019t even pay the parking meter. \nAt about 9:30 he hops out again. \nHim: hey, are you hungry yet?\nMe: no, I\u2019m okay, I ate before I came out here. \nHim: Come on, I want to give you something but I don\u2019t have any cash, let me buy you dinner. \nThis does happen, when someone who doesn\u2019t carry cash sees a street musician that they like they will often offer to buy a snack and bring it to you, so I didn\u2019t find that strange. \nMe: okay, sure, if you want to bring me a snack that\u2019s cool. \nHim: ok, come with me. \nMe: Uh, no, I\u2019m not leaving my spot here.\nHim: There\u2019s a really good restaurant I want to take you to, but it\u2019s too far to walk, we need to drive there. \nMe: sorry, I\u2019m really not interested in going somewhere, I need to stay here and make some money tonight. \nHim: I thought you were hungry, come on, let me buy you dinner. \nMe, starting to get frustrated: No, I told you I\u2019m not actually that hungry. If you want to tip me with something other than cash, a slice of pizza from the place across the street, or a soda, or a cigarette\u2014That I\u2019m fine with, but I\u2019m not leaving my spot. \nHim: No, I\u2019m not going to buy you a slice of pizza, if you want dinner you need to come with me. \nAt this point, tons of people were walking past us, and I was getting really annoyed at him for keeping me from playing music. \nMe: well I\u2019m not going anywhere, and I need to make some money tonight, so I\u2019m done talking about this. \nAt that point I started playing my guitar, to show him that I was done with this conversation. I probably should have been more concerned by this point, but I was honestly just pissed off. It wasn\u2019t that uncommon for men who saw me street performing to offer me food or shelter in exchange for sex, so I kind of assumed that\u2019s what he was after at that point. \nFor about the next hour, I focused on just playing music and chatting with people, and it was actually a pretty productive night. I had almost forgotten about the creepy dude\u2026 Until he got out of his car and leaned against the door, still staring at me. At this point it was almost 11 pm, and it dawned on me that he had been here for over two hours. That\u2019s when the alarm bells finally started to go off in my head. I had a hard time focusing on music after that because he was just standing there, staring at me, and the longer it lasted, the more I felt like he had something more nefarious than just trying to bribe a young \u201chomeless\u201d woman to sleep with him in mind. At about 11:30, I realized I needed to do something sooner rather than later. It was pretty much peak bar hour, but the streets were going to become less crowded eventually, and I was going to be walking home; I didn\u2019t want to risk him following me. \nNow, when I\u2019m street performing, I\u2019m in Friendly Mode, and I\u2019m not the most intimidating-looking girl in general, so I don\u2019t think he was expecting me to confront him directly. But when I feel threatened, I tend to get pretty mad, pretty fast. Figuring I had plenty of witnesses, I walked right up to him, angry as hell by this point. \nMe: Why are you staring at me?\nHim, taken aback: huh?\nMe: you\u2019ve been staring at me for three hours now. Do you just like making younger women uncomfortable?\nI was mad, talking progressively faster and louder, and it was very clear this wasn\u2019t going the way he expected it to. \nHim: no, no, no\u2026 I want to buy you dinner.\nMe: So you\u2019re just waiting for me to get hungry enough to go get dinner with you, when I\u2019ve already said no several times? That\u2019s not being helpful, it\u2019s being creepy. I know there aren\u2019t any restaurants that are still open at that are still open at 11:30 pm around here. \nHim: no, no, this one is! It\u2019s still open!\nMe: I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s still open because I don\u2019t want to go anywhere with you, and I told you that. So why are you still here waiting? \nHim: no, you don\u2019t understand\u2026\nHe looked like he was wracking his brain for an excuse. \nMe: What? What am I not understanding about you STARING AT ME for the last THREE HOURS?\nHim: no, you see, i\u2019m an Uber driver!  \nOf all the stupid excuses he could\u2019ve picked, this was possibly the stupidest. \nMe, pretending to \u201cunderstand\u201d: Oh! Okay, I get it, you\u2019ve been waiting all this time for someone who ordered an Uber!\nHim, smiling: yes, yes!\nMe, dropping the act: and you were just going to leave them waiting while you took me to a restaurant, then?\nWhat happened next freaked me out more than anything else that night. As soon as I blew a hole through his piss-poor cover story, it was like he took off a mask. His smile disappeared, and his voice was deadly serious as he climbed back into his car and said to me\n\u201cOkay. You will never see my face again.\u201d \nAnd he drove off. Fast. \nI just stood there shook. I\u2019d had plenty of creepy encounters while street performing, but not like this. It was impossible to convince myself that he was going to do anything besides abduct me. \nI was done after that. I decided to order an actual Uber home instead of walking, which cost about half of what I\u2019d made in tips that night. In the back of that Uber, counting my cash, I realized that it was time to retire. The small amount of money I made during the daytime was not worth the effort, and the decent money I made at night was not worth the risk. \nI\u2019ve since moved on to a new side hustle, and also developed agoraphobia (diagnosed) because of this and other incidents like it. I hate leaving the house alone, I order most of my groceries and household supplies through DoorDash, and I have a job that\u2019s only three blocks away from my apartment. Still, on my walks to and from work, I find myself constantly checking my surroundings, using the reflection in storefront windows to make sure I\u2019m not being followed. \nSo, creepy guy in the beige SUV, I hope you keep your promise, and that I never see your face again.

It contains several provisions that may be of interest to UAP-focused communities.\nThe main UAP-related material is found in Title X (pages 215-218), consisting of three numbered sections, 1001-1003. \nSection 1002 is a technical change of little interest.\nSection 1001 requires the Comptroller General to conduct \"a review\" of the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), the Pentagon's \"UFO office.\" The Comptroller General is the head of the Government Accountability Office (GAO), which is a support component of Congress, not a part of the Executive Branch.\nThe GAO review would encompass \"implementation by the Office [AARO] of the duties and requirements of\" the previously enacted laws that created AARO and gave it certain mandates and missions, \"such as the process for operational unidentified anomalous phenomena reporting and coordination with the Department of Defense, the intelligence community, and other departments and agencies of the Federal Government and non-Government entities.\"\nThe GAO review may also include \"such other matters relating to the activities of\" AARO as the GAO considers appropriate. This might include, for example, review of AARO's reports on the history of U.S. government involvement in UAP. AARO published a controversial initial historical report in March 2024, and is supposed to issue a final historical report later this month, although it is not clear whether that statutory \"deadline\" will be met.\nThe delivery date for the proposed GAO report would be set later by agreement among designated congressional leadership and the Comptroller General.\nSection 1003 is not new language. It simply extends through FY 2025 a provision of the enacted FY 2024 IAA law that prohibits funding of Intelligence Community controlled-access programs \"involving\" UAP \"unless the Director of National Intelligence has provided the details of the activity\" to the congressional intelligence committees and top congressional leadership. This language was originally proposed in the SSCI in July 2023 by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), co-sponsored by Senators Mike Rounds (R-SD), John Cornyn (R-TX), and Marco Rubio (R-FL).\nIn many years, but not all, the Intelligence Authorization Act is merged with the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) at a later stage in the legislative process. When this is done, the final votes in the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate are on a merged NDAA-IAA, and the two measures are sent to the President as a single bill.\nThe Senate Armed Services Committee has scheduled voting sessions (called markups) on the Fiscal Year 2025 NDAA on June 12-14, 2024. The House of Representatives is expected to consider amendments to its version of NDAA (H.R. 8070) later this month.\nIn addition to the UAP provisions described above, Title VIII of the Intelligence Authorization Act (S. 4443) contains 28 pages (pp. 181-208) of proposed new provisions to enhance protections for whistleblowers who are members or former members of the Intelligence Community.\nThese provisions are associated with Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR), who has not been publicly associated with particular interest in UAP. However, some of his proposed changes in law conceivably could have application to some would-be whistleblowers who possess UAP-related information.\nThe complete PDF of S. 4443, as approved the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on May 22, 2024, can be viewed or downloaded from the link below.\nhttps://www.congress.gov/118/bills/s4443/BILLS-118s4443rs.pdf", "media": null, "score": 37, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "comment_count": 1, "over_18": false}, "49": {"id": "1d7d41v", "locked": false, "subreddit": "conspiracy", "stickied": false, "category": "Consipiracy", "author": "EndMySufferingNowPlz", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1717814599.2369308, "created_utc": 1717442886.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/7bh2izogre4d1.png", "title": "When is the last time you heard anything about the Las Vegas mass shooting", "permalink": "/r/conspiracy/comments/1d7d41v/when_is_the_last_time_you_heard_anything_about/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 2033, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "comment_count": 329, "over_18": false}, "50": {"id": "1darp00", "locked": false, "subreddit": "conspiracyfact", "stickied": false, "category": "Consipiracy", "author": "Affectionate_Bet_793", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1717814599.5177617, "created_utc": 1717811185.0, "url": "https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/alien-tom/episodes/New-Normal-News-14-June-7--2024-e2kjhaf", "title": "Under the Radar News & Headlines Not Covered by MSM #14 (June 7, 2024) ", "permalink": "/r/conspiracyfact/comments/1darp00/under_the_radar_news_headlines_not_covered_by_msm/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comment_count": 0, "over_18": false}, "51": {"id": "1d5l8ao", "locked": false, "subreddit": "bigfoot", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "Powerful_Hair_3105", "link_flair_text": "tik tok ", "time": 1717814600.5272555, "created_utc": 1717242567.0, "url": "https://v.redd.it/bk20abar7y3d1", "title": "Messin With Sasquatch these are from the old school commercials wanted to share I made this too this one's all of them I think but I may have missed a couple", "permalink": "/r/bigfoot/comments/1d5l8ao/messin_with_sasquatch_these_are_from_the_old/", "selftext": "", "media": {"reddit_video": {"bitrate_kbps": 1200, "fallback_url": "https://v.redd.it/bk20abar7y3d1/DASH_480.mp4?source=fallback", "has_audio": true, "height": 854, "width": 480, "scrubber_media_url": "https://v.redd.it/bk20abar7y3d1/DASH_96.mp4", "dash_url": "https://v.redd.it/bk20abar7y3d1/DASHPlaylist.mpd?a=1720406599%2CM2ZiZGRmZWU5MjA5ZTczODMxZjY0YzYyZGJmOWRjOGY4M2MxOTBjYWM5YjZhMmRhMGU5MmExMjE0YmQ5NzY5Mg%3D%3D&v=1&f=sd", "duration": 208, "hls_url": "https://v.redd.it/bk20abar7y3d1/HLSPlaylist.m3u8?a=1720406599%2CMmJkN2QzOWUzN2ZiZWI0N2U4ODg2YzE1Y2I0NmM4OTNiNzQ3ZTM3YWMxNDY2MjkxYzRiNzJiODNhMDFjZTY5OQ%3D%3D&v=1&f=sd", "is_gif": false, "transcoding_status": "completed"}}, "score": 251, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comment_count": 26, "over_18": false}, "52": {"id": "1d9u4pf", "locked": false, "subreddit": "cryptozoology", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "truthisfictionyt", "link_flair_text": "Evidence", "time": 1717814601.356948, "created_utc": 1717710439.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1d9u4pf", "title": "A photograph of a \"red gorilla\" shot by Belgian administrator Fernand Wilmet in the modern Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Normally I ignore these as I don\u2019t like picking up unknown numbers and assume if it\u2019s important enough I\u2019ll likely receive a voice message or an email shortly after, so I let it ring out.

I remember it being an odd sound but distressing to hear in a voice message, and this went on for the rest of the voice message. \nBecause of its odd nature I decided to save the voice message and was planning on showing some friends when I need got the chance to see what their thoughts were, but for some reason when I went to check my voice messages next, it was just gone, to this day I have no idea what it was, but nothing more ever happened other than that,\nI thought I\u2019d post this to see if anyone else has experienced anything similar before.", "media": null, "score": 18, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "comment_count": 4, "over_18": false}, "55": {"id": "1d8hh8x", "locked": false, "subreddit": "letsnotmeet", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Jaybo99", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1717814602.6586154, "created_utc": 1717562219.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1d8hh8x/burglar_in_a_halloween_mask/", "title": "Burglar in a Halloween mask ", "permalink": "/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1d8hh8x/burglar_in_a_halloween_mask/", "selftext": "I have been lurking on this sub a while and enjoy reading people\u2019s experiences.  While perusing, I recalled a story of my own from my childhood I had mostly forgotten. Here it is:\nMy (36M) parents divorced when I was 4/5 yrs old. During and after the divorce, my brother (let\u2019s call him Chris), my mom, and I move into a two bedroom apartment townhouse. \nNow this is not the nice \u201ctownhouse\u201d you may imagine. It wasn\u2019t complete shit hole per se but they were older (built in 60s, this is 1990s) and in a rougher part of town. Something a single mother with two kids could swing. \nThe layout of the apartment is important to the story, so bare with me. When you walk in the front door, the kitchen is immediately to your left and there\u2019s a short entrance hallway in front of you.\nThe kitchen has an open countertop area that looks into a dining spot for a table and a split level living room/den area that also had glass sliding doors leading to the backyard (no fence or privacy) where there was a (rather sad and sparse) playground. \nIn the hallway entrance again, on the right is a staircase leading up to my mom\u2019s and my/my brother\u2019s rooms.\nOne day after school, my brother and I are out playing in the backyard on the playground, doing our kid stuff when my mom told us she wanted to go check the mail. The mailboxes of the apartments are located at the front entrance which is on the opposite side of the complex from us. \nNaturally, me being 5 and Chris, 9, my mom didn\u2019t want to leave us alone, esp since it was about dark outside. \nWe came inside and got ready to leave. On the way out I remember my mom asking Chris is he had closed and locked the sliding glass door. Chris said he had. \nCut to, we are back from the mail room, it\u2019s maybe been 20-30 min max. It\u2019s hard to recall fully. But my mom unlocks the apt door, I\u2019m lingering in the car for some reason or other, Chris doesn\u2019t notice I\u2019m not in the apt yet and on the stairs leading to the bedrooms on the right, he sees someone\u2019s feet disappear at the top of the landing. As if someone were running to hide. Thinking they\u2019re me, he doesn\u2019t think something\u2019s off. \nChris goes to the kitchen and I actually go upstairs directly into our bed room to get ready for the bed/bath in the bathroom. My mom is at the table in the dining area near the split level living area downstairs. \nWhile I\u2019m completely clueless getting ready for bed in the bathroom, Chris, from downstairs, keeps hearing someone walking around in my mom\u2019s bedroom. Now,  I had a bad habit when I was this age of going through people\u2019s stuff. Not maliciously, I was barely 5, just curiosity, whatever. And Chris, thinking I\u2019m being a nosy bastard going through all of our mom\u2019s jewelry, etc., runs upstairs to catch me in the act and get me in trouble.\nChris runs up the stairs, sprints across the hall to my mom\u2019s bedroom and throws himself stomach first on the bed. When he looks up, he sees a tall, slender man with a bright green, goblin latex Halloween mask on and is holding a large knife he has swiped from the kitchen. \nMy brother sits silently in shock as the man in the goblin mask raises one finger to the mouth indicating for him to be quiet. And in true form for my brother, he screamed bloody murder for our mom. \nNow I have heard things going on but I have no idea and am not aware of what\u2019s happening. I have gotten into my big oversized sleep shirt and am going downstairs to have a glass of milk before bed. \nWhen Chris screamed, the man ran downstairs and encountered my mom who immediately jumped into action. Our baseball gear was in the living room and my mom grabbed a bat and started fighting this man in our house while he is taking swipes at her with the knife. \nI first notice what\u2019s happening when I have come downstairs to the kitchen, pulled up a step stool to reach the counter and to pour a glass of milk, and that\u2019s when I see over the bar the guy push my mom off the steps into the split level living room, landing on her back. She starts swinging the bat wildly, trying to make any contact with it, and she does. \nI\u2019m glued to this image. Truly frozen in place. Not scared just so young that you can\u2019t fully process what you\u2019re seeing. \nThe man finally runs toward the front door which is right by the kitchen. I\u2019m midpour in my glass of milk, frozen, milk continuing to spill out all over the counter and floor. He stops and turns directly to me, and in that green, goblin mask with the knife, screams a primal, deep sound  of rage and frustration and then slams the door so hard the whole place shakes.\nI continued standing on my stool pouring milk everywhere, frozen for, I don\u2019t know, could have been a second but felt so long. \nI don\u2019t remember what happened after that but all of the parts I\u2019ve relayed are very clear to me. \nMoral: LOCK YOUR DOORS. And don\u2019t just assume you did. \nAnd dear Man in the goblin mask, let\u2019s not meet\u2026. Again.

The entire universe works together to mimic that frequency and bring it towards you in events, situations or people.\nMore importantly, bringing up your Spiritual Energy while doing that allows your frequency to travel virtually in three dimensions all throughout the universe, in all directions simultaneously with the same intensity and this can even be picked up all over the globe by other people.\nSpiritual Energy, just like\u00a0Qi,\u00a0Prana,\u00a0Vayus,\u00a0Piti,\u00a0Odic Force,\u00a0Tension,\u00a0Aura,\u00a0Mana,\u00a0Orgone,\u00a0BioElectric,\u00a0Euphoria,\u00a0Ecstasy,\u00a0Nen, Secret Fire,\u00a0Aether,\u00a0R\u00fbah,\u00a0Intent\u00a0and more is another word to define the Vital Energy/Life Force that you and every other living thing has.\nThis Spiritual Energy can be most easily felt within us when experiencing\u00a0Frisson, or as the\u00a0Runner's High, as the\u00a0Vibrational State\u00a0before an Astral Projection, as\u00a0Qi\u00a0in Taoism / Martial Arts, as\u00a0Prana\u00a0in Hindu philosophy, during an\u00a0ASMR\u00a0session and felt within us as\u00a0Chills from positive events/stimuli.\nThis energy has been researched and documented under many names, by different people and cultures\u00a0such as\u00a0Bioelectricity,\u00a0Life force,\u00a0Prana,\u00a0Chi,\u00a0Qi,\u00a0Runner's High,\u00a0Euphoria,\u00a0ASMR,\u00a0Ecstasy,\u00a0Orgone,\u00a0Rapture,\u00a0Tension,\u00a0Aura,\u00a0Mana,\u00a0Vayus,\u00a0Nen,\u00a0Intent,\u00a0Tummo,\u00a0Odic force,\u00a0Kriyas,\u00a0Pit\u012b,\u00a0Frisson,\u00a0Ruah,\u00a0Spiritual Energy, Secret Fire,\u00a0The Tingles,\u00a0on-demand quickening,\u00a0Voluntary Piloerection,\u00a0Aether,\u00a0Chills,\u00a0Spiritual Chills\u00a0and many more to be discovered hopefully with your help.\nHere are\u00a0three written tutorials going more in-depth on how to control this energy and on the technique to use your spiritual energy to consciously send out something you want to attract back in your life.\nP.S. Everyone feels it at certain points in their life, some brush it off while others notice that there is something much deeper going on.

We're a team of reporters and experiencers taking disclosure into our own hands.\nThis summer, we're flying to Puerto Rico, Mexico, and different parts of the USA.

Do you have any personal experiences in Puerto Rico?\nWe are driven by the abduction story of our team leader Krystal's abduction. Here's her abduction story:\nMy grandpa gave me a map from Seattle to Sedona to visit spring training for the Mariners. The year was 1996, the sun hadn\u2019t come up yet, and I was driving down a road in Arizona. The road was very flat, and you could see everything. It was one of those serene moments where I found myself reflecting on many things as I drove.\nThen, I saw a light, super bright, brighter than anything I had ever seen before. It was an intense, almost otherworldly light that seemed to pierce through the darkness. The light went through me. It was so bright that I could see it out of my peripheral vision too. And that is what I remembered.\nThe next thing I remember, I was at the baseball game I was driving to. I was standing outside the ticket box because even though it\u2019s like spring training; you still have to buy tickets. I was confused; it was as if I had blacked out. I was standing there in a daze when I heard people shouting my name: \"KRYSTAL, KRYSTAL.\"\nThey were like, \"Hey!\" Them saying my name snapped me out of whatever mental zone I was in. They were on the other side of the fence, and they asked, \"Do you have a ticket?\" I replied, \"No, I was just trying to figure out...\" One of them then said, \"I have an extra ticket.\"\nThe game started at 2 PM. I had left driving at 5 AM, which meant I had been gone for hours. I had no recollection of where I had parked my car. My friends had to help me find it. It was a bewildering experience, and I couldn't shake off the feeling of lost time and the vivid memory of that bright light.", "media": null, "score": 13, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "comment_count": 12, "over_18": false}, "68": {"id": "1d6yy7m", "locked": false, "subreddit": "letsnotmeet", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Emotional-Diet-7385", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1717814615.058704, "created_utc": 1717400589.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1d6yy7m/they_did_not_steal_anything/", "title": "They did not steal anything.", "permalink": "/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1d6yy7m/they_did_not_steal_anything/", "selftext": "Hello all !  I have been a reader on this sub for many years now, and it has occurred to me to share something that happened to me when I was 15(f)\nTo put in context, I was living in a pretty big house on a very safe, and popular district. Let me tell you a little bit about the house because it has its importance: We were five living there for starters, my brother (then 17) my sister (17) and usually my parents.  This settled\u2014 the house was as follows: \nA ground floor with my sister\u2019s bedroom\u2014 a very large room which gave to the garden by a large patio window/door. A nice room with computers, a TV and some jewellery.\nThen, you go up one floor, and you have the living room, the kitchen, the first bathroom and the parent\u2019s bedroom. And again, TV in the living room\u2026 jewellery in the bathroom and the parent\u2019s room\u2026 and even money in the drawers, as my father had to pay for important work on our heating system and planned to pay in cash. Why? Good question but he might look at me strange if I ask now. \nThird and last floor, my bedroom, my brother\u2019s bedroom, the second bathroom and the sauna. (Ah yes, it seems a luxury to have this thing but near all houses have it where we lived then, and to be honest we only used it as a wine cave!)\nYou get where this is going, don\u2019t you ;) ? \nSo let me jump into the story. It was not a dark and stormy night, but it was certainly dark enough. Around five pm, and the world was already black, as it tends to be in this country in winter. My brother and sisters were not there \u2014 sharing a class, and were consequently still at school. \nMy parents on the other end, were in France for some administration issues they needed to sort. They had not been home since a week. \nBut I was there. I was there, and as any self respecting teenager, I was in my bedroom, the rest of the house in complete darkness. I had my headphones on, watching a movie in my bed\u2014 but there was light in my room. It is important to note my window gave to the street. \nHalf an hour pass. One hour. I\u2019m still deep in my movie. I don\u2019t hear the noise in my house. I don\u2019t hear anything but my movie. \nI lift my eyes from my screen \u2014 and I see my doorknob turning. It\u2019s all very quick. I take off my headphones, thinking it is my brother or sister, the door opens\u2014\nAnd I\u2019m facing an unknown man in my house. He\u2019s young. Twenty or so.  He looks at me, I look at him, there\u2019s two seconds or so, and he slams the door the hardest he can. \nI\u2019m on my feet in seconds, and I was a pretty dumb teenager because I immediately open the door \u2014 only to find three men running down the stairs. Unknown men, mind you. So I am frozen in fear for five, ten minutes. Eventually,  I get down the stairs too, to the kitchen where I can grab a knife. \nSlowly, I explore first my parent\u2019s room. It\u2019s a mess. There\u2019s drawers open, papers, clothes, everything. And. There is the money. There is the jewellery. There is the TV. The computer. Nothing has been taken. \nI proceed to the other parts of the house, calling my brother and sister. They don\u2019t answer. I\u2019m calling now my best friend who speaks the country\u2019s language so she can call the cops for me \u2014 mind I don\u2019t speak English at the time. The more I proceed through the house, the more it\u2019s a mess. \nBut nothing has been taken. Absolutely nothing. \nThey broke through my sister\u2019s window patio door\u2014 and there was broken glass everywhere. But in her room too, nothing taken. \nThe police came with dogs, we did finally tell our parents after everyone else lol, but they never found the guys. Being an idiot teenager, I used the opportunity to miss school the following day although I wasn\u2019t really traumatised, just curious. \nBut still, robbers who didn\u2019t rob, let\u2019s not meet again.", "media": null, "score": 39, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "comment_count": 9, "over_18": true}, "69": {"id": "1d6q6ff", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ghosts", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "HuffStuff1975", "link_flair_text": "WDYT?
