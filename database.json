The act sets up a process for disclosing information on UFOs as well as ensuring any recovered technology would belong to the government.\nThe act gives government agencies up to 300 days to turn over any information on UFOs, including records along with any samples or technology that may have been recovered.\nWhile agencies have 300 days to gather and turn over information, President Joe Biden has 90 days from when the act goes into effect to form an UAP [UFO] Independent Review Board.\nThe nine-member board cannot include anyone connected to existing UAP research or programs and has to include at least one national security officer, foreign service official, scientist or engineer, economist, professional historian and sociologist.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Once agencies have turned all their information over, the review board has 180 days to investigate and must publish its findings within 14 days after the investigation concludes.\nThe act also establishes eminent domain over any technology of unknown origin or biological remains from nonhuman intelligence. In other words, if aliens land in your backyard, you don\u2019t get to keep them or their flying saucer.\nNow is a good time to contact your Congress[wo]man and Senators to urge that the\u00a0the UAP [UFO] Disclosure Act of 2023 and the\u00a0National Defense Authorization Bill (NDAA) of 2023\u00a0be passed and monitored after becoming law.\nRichard Boylan, Ph.D., Councillor\nwww,drboylan.com #UFOTwitter", "media": null, "score": 1201, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comment_count": 178, "over_18": false}, "7": {"id": "16u1amf", "locked": false, "subreddit": "unresolvedmysteries", "stickied": false, "category": "Crime", "author": "Basic_Bichette", "link_flair_text": "Update", "time": 1696041402.8548856, "created_utc": 1695861142.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/16u1amf/baby_precious_murdered_infant_discovered_in/", "title": "\"Baby Precious\", murdered infant discovered in Portland, Oregon in 2013, identified as Baby Amara; father arrested", "permalink": "/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/16u1amf/baby_precious_murdered_infant_discovered_in/", "selftext": "Here's an awful horrible one I haven't seen on this subreddit; all the warnings on this one.\nOn May 28, 2013 workers at a recycling centre on Swan Island in Portland, Oregon discovered the body of a newborn baby girl on a conveyer belt. An autopsy confirmed the supposition that she had been killed, but despite numerous attempts to identify her the case soon went cold. She was dubbed \"Baby Precious\" and given a funeral.\nIn 2019 Detective Brandon McGuire of the Portland Police Bureau's Cold Case Unit was given the case, with Bode Technology hired to obtain a DNA profile from the remains and perform genetic genealogical research. After three years of work and numerous investigative leads the little girl has now been identified as Baby Amara, after a comparison with an anonymous family member.\nThe bio father and alleged perpetrator is Alnath Omar Oliver of Portland who, while in his forties, allegedly impregnated a 15-year-old child and prevented her from escaping him or even obtaining the most basic prenatal health care during her pregnancy. After he allegedly forced his victim to give birth on the floor of his apartment he took the child away, telling her he was taking her to the hospital; shortly thereafter Amara's remains were discovered at Swan Island. Oliver told investigators that the child had died \"on the way to the hospital\", and that he'd \"placed\" the body in a recycling bin. \nSure, buddy. Sure.\nAlnath Oliver is being charged with two counts of second-degree manslaughter, two counts of first-degree criminal mistreatment, third-degree rape (against the child's mother) and concealing the birth of an infant. Amara's mother was under the impression that the child had been taken to the hospital and adopted out, and was still alive; she is fully cooperating with authorities.\nEdit to add: hospitals in Oregon are designated \"safe haven\" locations, where unwanted newborns can be legally surrendered without the parents being charged. I don't know if the 15-year-old victim realized that, but in her place I might have assumed the child would be fine too. It's just heartbreaking.\nIncidentally, Amara is referred to as \"Amara Oliver\" in some sources not to honour her father but to protect her mother's (and fellow victim's) identity. I'm calling her Baby Amara.\n\nhttps://unidentified-awareness.fandom.com/wiki/Amara_Oliver\nhttps://www.kgw.com/article/news/crime/baby-precious-cold-case-recycling-center-homicide-father-identity/283-f7433203-3c1c-42e2-88fe-dd8c28ea994b\nhttps://nypost.com/2023/09/23/oregon-father-arrested-10-years-after-newborns-body-found-on-recycling-plant-conveyor-belt/\nSorry for the New York Post story, but it condenses about eight other links' info and doesn't contain anything inaccurate.", "media": null, "score": 1413, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comment_count": 103, "over_18": false}, "8": {"id": "16th3eh", "locked": false, "subreddit": "morbidreality", "stickied": false, "category": "Crime", "author": "Old-Cut-4197", "link_flair_text": "Adults in their 20s, not teens.", "time": 1696041403.4223835, "created_utc": 1695811195.0, "url": "https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT8632uKa/", "title": "Officer stops teens for speeding. 14 minutes later, the same officer responds to a call discovering the same teens in a fatal car accident\u2026", "permalink": "/r/MorbidReality/comments/16th3eh/officer_stops_teens_for_speeding_14_minutes_later/", "selftext": "Please remember to drive safe everyone\u2026", "media": {"type": "tiktok.com", "oembed": {"provider_url": "http://www.tiktok.com", "description": "102.7K Likes, 1.7K Comments.

Dad says he is planning to buy dried mangoes to add to our cereal around October just for fun if the price isn't too high.  \nMonday late evening, I'm at evening/night school sitting in Programming (Theory) class while also working on a year-long essay about AI on my school computer while my eyes are feeling terrible since stepping foot on the school grounds at 8 pm and it was now 10 pm. My eyes start to water and they're so red, so i turn to open Facebook to ask my mum if I could do something to alleviate this pain when my computer gets an alert; \"High Pollen In Your Area, 75% Take Caution Beware Of Allergic Reactions\". I press the alert for more information because I'm slowly panicking, I've been allergic to pollen since I was a baby, it's an allergy that has stuck by me for 24 years! My town is in the red-orange part and my area is surrounded by farms! I checked and mango and grass pollen is on the rise, mango pollen at 70% and grass at 5%. I text my mum and she advises me to when i return home to wash my eyes. I do that.  \nTuesday morning 7 am wake up from the feeling of my eyes being on fire, I go to the bathroom to see the white part of the iris being pinkish red and my under eyelid also red. Wash my face and put some eyedrops and go back to bed. I dream about mangoes again! This time I'm cutting pieces to feed my dream daughter.  \nThroughout Tuesday the word mangoes and the fruit appeared on my TikTok For You Page at least seven times, my sister's best friends visited and one of them was eating Greek Yogurt with mango pieces in it. While my sister as she was getting ready she asked for a lip balm and her other best friend had one that was...you guessed it...mango flavoured!  \nAfter they left I went to spend some time with my aunt who was watching a trivia game on the TV and the word was mango. We also played a trivia game and mango came up twice. I'm painting my nails while hanging out with her and I want to put on some hand cream and she gives me one that had a mango scent.  \nIt's Wednesday, today, and I heard the word mangoes three times before 6 p.m. I'm in class again and I decided to check the pollen levels because my eyes still feel itchy and sore, still in the 75% but now you can add ambrosia the plant to the mix that is responsible for the pollen levels.  \nAnnoyed I decided to google ambrosia plant farms and mango farms in my area came up with a big fat nothing! None of those are native to my country or area.  \nI have had a few times in my life mangoes but mostly the dried and sugar-added ones. I'm not a huge fan to say that I have been craving them.  \nWhy am I hearing about mangoes so much? Is the universe trying to tell me something? Or is it a coincidence?

Due to the nature of this subreddit and because it's a hot button topic on social media in general, we receive a lot of posts and comments about encounters being possible human trafficking.\nUnfortunately, there is a massive amount of misinformation about what human trafficking is and isn't, and the vast majority of these interactions here in this subreddit and elsewhere on social media are not how trafficking typically occurs.\nWhat is human trafficking, anyway?\nHuman trafficking is the movement of people through coercion, deception, force and any combination of those three, for exploitative sex, labor, or both. Human trafficking DOES NOT usually occur by spotting some girl alone out and about, following her and kidnapping her or \"tagging\" her to kidnap later. For sex trafficking in particular, the people trafficked almost always know and often times love or trust the person that trafficked them.\u00a0\nHuman trafficking is, disgustingly, a business, and it'd be bad for business to grab some random girl that might have a rich family to look for her, and to do so in front of witnesses. While there have been a few cases of trafficking that have occurred that way (it's sensational and scary, or we wouldn't know about it), it is by far the exception and not the rule. You are more likely to be trafficked by a romantic partner than anyone else.\nHow it happens\n\"The most pervasive myth about human trafficking is that it often involves kidnapping or physically forcing someone into a situation. In reality, most traffickers use psychological means such as, tricking, defrauding, manipulating or threatening victims into providing commercial sex or exploitative labor. Another myth is that traffickers target victims they don't know. Many survivors have been trafficked by romantic partners, including spouses, and by family members, including parents.\"\u00a0- Polaris Project\n\"Perpetrators of human trafficking span all racial, ethnic, and gender demographics and are as diverse as survivors. Some use their privilege, wealth, and power as a means of control while others experience the same socio-economic oppression as their victims. They include individuals, business owners, members of a gang or network, parents or family members of victims, intimate partners, owners of farms or restaurants, and powerful corporate executives and government representatives.\" - Polaris Project\nRecent Statistics\nBased on data* from the 2021 National Report by The Human Trafficking Hotline:\n\n\n72% of trafficking is for sex, 10% is for forced labor, 4% is for both sex and labor, with the remaining 14% being for unspecified purposes.\n\n\n62% of sex trafficking victims are adults, 28% are minors. In some cases, demographic information is not provided to the hotline, which is why the percentage here doesn't add up to 100%.\n\n\n84% of sex trafficking victims are female, 8% are male, with the remaining 8% having another gender identity, defined as someone who identifies as any identity other than cisgender male or female.\n\n\nIn the vast majority of cases (33%), the country of origin of victims was unknown. When the country of origin was known, the majority of victims were US citizens.\u00a0\n*note: this data is all from substantiated tips received by the hotline from January 1, 2021 until December 31, 2021, the vast majority of which came from victims themselves.\u00a0\nAdditional Info & Sources\nFor more information, please visit Polaris Project, a wonderful resource for information about human trafficking and ways to help if you are interested, or The Human Trafficking Hotline, which keeps one of the most extensive data sets on human trafficking in the United States.\nIf you believe you or someone you know is a victim of human trafficking, you can also call +18883737888 (open 24/7) to make a report (this is a United States number, if you suspect human trafficking in another country, please refer to your country\u2019s national human trafficking hotline).\nYou can also text 233733 with HELP or INFO to get more information or to report suspected human trafficking in the United States.\nHere is a story from this exact subreddit that we approved with verification that describes OP's experience.\nAny misinformation about trafficking in this thread will result in it being locked.\u00a0 Any off topic comments will be removed.", "media": null, "score": 204, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comment_count": 20, "over_18": true}, "13": {"id": "16v72hp", "locked": false, "subreddit": "morbidhistory", "stickied": false, "category": "Crime", "author": "Turtlesquadz", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1696041404.4733377, "created_utc": 1695980287.0, "url": "https://youtu.be/uk3oc2vmiWk?si=FjjQEYyvJo7KUVa_", "title": "Dubbed the babysitter killer, A serial killer in the 1960s-1970s killed multiple children and would neatly lay their bodies around town (bathed & cleaned).

They seem genuinely terrified of what happened and they have told very few people about this experience.\nIn the summer of 1990 my Mom (31), Dad (35) and brother (15) attended an Aerosmith concert in Ohio. After the concert the 3 of them were walking to the parking lot in a huge crowd of people. My parents were standing on one side of the street about to step off the curb when they saw 2 hooded figures across the street. By the time their foot hit the pavement the figures were directly in front of them. They seemed to float without feet and moved from one side of the street to the other in an instant.\nThe next thing they know they are standing alone, not in the exact same place that they were, with their arms outstretched from the elbow palms facing up and their hands and forearms are tingling.\nThey made their way back to the car and no one else was around. The parking lot was empty except for their car. My brother was sitting on the bumper waiting for them and said he had been waiting for them for about 2 hours. My parents have no recollection of what happened during that 2 hour period. My brother says that he was walking and he turned around and they were gone and he just went back to the car and waited.\n2 weeks after this incident my mom finds out that she is pregnant with me. They believe this may be the reason they were approached.\nI personally have never experienced anything unexplainable like this but I do believe their story. I have never known them to make things up and they are not psychotic. They believe this encounter was some kind of extraterrestrial being. I believe their experience was genuine but I\u2019m not certain that aliens are the explanation but I\u2019m also not ruling it out.\nThis happened in a post concert crowd with hundreds of people around. Has anyone had a similar experience or any insight on what could have happened to them?\nUpdate: For those of you saying they were dosed, I agree that this is strong possibility but I am not aware of any drug that can cause this. I shared this to r/psychonauts to see if they have any input.

The first time I stayed there, I'm always having headaches and it feels like the energy in the house is heavy. I didn't mind it at first but things got more worse than I expected.\nI never experienced any of this from any other place, it all started there. \nI always sleep on the bed with my friend then it always feels like someone is watching me. I always shrugged off that feeling at first then I keep on seeing a woman with a long hair and white dress watching me sleep. I always wake up at 3am and it scares the sh*t out of me. I ignored it at first but one time I woke up and she was beside the bed, standing and when I checked her face, her head is crooked and she was looking at me. I immediately shook my friend to wake her up and she was not there anymore. \nI keep on seeing her and even had a nightmare about it so I got used to it. I asked my friend since I keep on getting headaches whenever I walk the hall beside the stairs and that's when she told me the story of the house.\nThe last owner of the house hang herself up in the second floor and I got chills after hearing that stories. I even told her to get rid of the doll facing the stairs that leads to that room. \nSince I got used to her, I just always try to ignore her when she's there. \nThen one time, I was preparing my coffee at 3AM and if I don't walk on the hallway beside the stairs to go to the kitchen, I had to go around the dining area with a big mirror on it. Like the mirror that you have on a dance studio or a ballet studio. I'm done with my coffee so I decided to go back to our room, when I was walking back to our room, I was looking outside and I saw a black figure besides the pool with a yellow glowing eyes. We were staring at each other for like 15 secs because I want to make sure that what I'm seeing was real and I was frozen on what I saw. I walked and acted normally when I went back to the room, I decided to wake up my friend and I was shaking.\nThis was before I experienced this https://reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/s/biGYGZeLpq at my ex boyfriend's house.\nSo yeah, that's when it all started.

It was very frantically opened. \nWhen my partner got dressed and went to the kitchen, we heard the front door close - the person left. Nothing had been taken but the storage cupboard door was open and toilet roll packaging was pulled out onto the bathroom floor. \nUpon speaking to my flatmates, one person was out and the other person who came home from work was asleep, so it was an intruder. \nWhy would they be opening and shutting  stuff in our bathroom?

At the time, she and her family were traveling on Royal Caribbean's Rhapsody of the Seas. She and her brother went to a party the night before and returned to their room around 3:30 AM. The two of them hung out on the balcony until around 5:30 AM. For the next 30-60 minutes, her actions are unknown, and her family discovered she was missing between 6:00-6:30 AM. She's never been seen since. \nHere's a link to The Charley Project with more info: https://charleyproject.org/case/amy-lynn-bradley\nI was researching this case for my blog, and I honestly have no idea what happened. From what I've seen, the main theories are that:\n\nshe was murdered and thrown overboard\nshe fell overboard or jumped\nshe was kidnapped/became a victim of human trafficking\n\nIt seems like you can make a case that any of these theories could fit, but there's not enough evidence to definitively say for sure. For example, there were several compelling sightings after Amy disappeared, but none of them have ever been verified. \nObviously, she didn't just vanish into thin air.

I saw his taillights get brighter like he was hitting his brakes, then he swerves down into the ditch line, and comes back out on the road and keeps going. As I approached the same area, I see this really tall, black figure walking in the road. It\u2019s moving in a very weird unnatural gait, like it was kind of blowing in the wind, but it clearly wasn\u2019t. I first thought it was a really tall person wrapped up in a big black blanket because I didn\u2019t see any arms or head, just two big legs and a torso. I had to swerve over to avoid it too, but I basically came to a full stop, and the thing walks passed my drivers window. It had to have been around 7 foot tall, as it was leaning forward and was at least a foot or so taller than the top of my vehicle. As it got behind my vehicle, I could see the taillights illuminating it\u2019s legs, but couldn\u2019t make out any details like hair or anything like clothing. Just large, thick, black legs. \nI took off down the road once it was behind me and saw that my coworker pulled into a gravel parking lot, so I pulled up beside him. He\u2019s freaking out asking if I saw it, and how it didn\u2019t have a head, and other ramblings. I said we should go back and try to see what the hell this thing is, because it seemed oblivious to us driving right at at. He didn\u2019t want to, but he ended up following behind me. We drove back the way we came and in around the same area, there was a large black dog laying across the road. This was not your normal size canine, it was much larger than any normal dog, but it looked dead. It wasn\u2019t there when we just drove through there less than 3 or so minutes beforehand. \nAnyway, I decided I was going to get out and go see if it\u2019s alive or not, and move it off to the side of the road because you can\u2019t really drive around it without going off the edge of the road on either side because the way it was laying across the road. As I get about 15 feet away, it raises its head up and looks back at me. It\u2019s eyes are glowing yellow, but I still say that was due to the vehicle lights causing eye shine. It lets out a low, deep, rumbling guttural growl and I stop instantly. It attempts to stand up, seems like it has some sort of issues with its front legs, but it stands up and continues to stand up, on two legs\u2026like a person would. \nIt only stood on its back legs for a second or two, enough time for it to look at me, but then it hunkers back down to what looks like on all fours and runs off to the wooded area, but there\u2019s a pretty tall fence there so I don\u2019t really know how it managed to disappear because it would of had to go over, under, or through the fence\u2026or it just vanished. I also don\u2019t think it was using its front legs when it ran off, because I never saw them really moving.\nNow after all this, there was one last strange happening. My coworker gets out of his car after the dog thing ran off, and he comes up to me to basically say wtf was that, and as we are talking, I noticed a mouse standing between us. It was also on its hind legs, kind of sitting as it is washing its face. I nudged it with my shoe, and it doesn\u2019t even seem to care. Kind of like the first thing that was walking, it was completely oblivious to our presence. It just kept on cleaning itself. \nWe left and went our separate ways. I woke up later in the day and started looking into werewolves and come across dogman stories. The only thing I will say about all of that is, this didn\u2019t have the hands and feet like is often claimed by witnesses. It had normal dog paws. It just had a large black wolf style look about itself, but it\u2019s fur was really fluffy, which didn\u2019t really seem to match with the normal wolf type fur. It wasn\u2019t a bear, it didn\u2019t have mange, I know the difference between a bear or something like that. It just looked like a very large black dog. \nThe first thing we saw, some people said sounds like a Fresno Nightcrawler but those have been white in appearance, and not nearly as thick and tall. Someone recently asked if maybe it had wings and that\u2019s what was concealing it\u2019s arms and head, as if they were draped around the front of it. I never thought about that before, and can\u2019t say one way or another because I didn\u2019t see any sort of details on its body, just blackness. The way it moved just seemed very odd, otherworldly. I always think of those inflatable tube man that flap around in the wind at car dealers or some sort of events when I try to describe it\u2019s movements. Just really weird. \nThe mouse, that might the oddest thing to me because I physically touched it, so I know it was real, but it just didn\u2019t seem to care. It wasn\u2019t until recently I made the connection that all three of the creatures were on two legs at one point. Are they all connected? Who knows.\nI never saw anything like that ever again, and I only live about 4 miles from where it happened and I drive through that area often. I wish I had more answers but all I get is more questions.\nAs someone who\u2019s been pretty skeptical most of my life, I\u2019ve tried to explain it away in some logical manner but I can\u2019t. I have said the dog was playing with the mouse, must of got hit and it\u2019s front legs were hurt, that would explain why it was walking on its back legs, and why the movement seemed unnatural. The mouse was traumatized from the dog messing with it, that explains why it looked all wet and why it was cleaning itself. That\u2019s the version I accepted for many years. The only problem with that is whatever was originally walking down the road was so much larger than the dog. When the dog stood up it was maybe 6 foot tall, but whatever walked by my window was at least 7 foot leaning forward. The walking torso was also a lot thicker than the dog, as the legs were very thick, the dogs were normal dog legs.\nTL;DR version: a coworker and I encountered a large black headless/armless walking torso, we turned around and went back to see what it was and found a large black dog that stood up on two legs, then ran off. While standing in the road talking about what happened, noticed a mouse standing upright cleaning itself next to us. Nudged it with my foot and it wasn\u2019t afraid, never ran off.", "media": null, "score": 133, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comment_count": 64, "over_18": false}, "62": {"id": "16tx5ju", "locked": false, "subreddit": "cryptids", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "truthisfictionyt", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1696041439.0588496, "created_utc": 1695851239.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/s2pkpdqecvqb1.jpg", "title": "The water elephant is an African cryptid described as a small tapir-like elephant that is semi-aquatic.

Do not forget this fact, it is very important you remember that yeah disclosure would be great, but they will not disclose a damn thing if the people paying their salaries are not going to do something about it.", "media": null, "score": 300, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "comment_count": 117, "over_18": false}, "66": {"id": "16u1tbt", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ufos", "stickied": false, "category": "Aliens", "author": "Dex507", "link_flair_text": "Witness/Sighting", "time": 1696041444.0823493, "created_utc": 1695862508.0, "url": "https://v.redd.it/mir5lzxo9wqb1", "title": "What the hell just happened far off the coast of Rhode Island???", "permalink": "/r/UFOs/comments/16u1tbt/what_the_hell_just_happened_far_off_the_coast_of/", "selftext": "", "media": {"reddit_video": {"bitrate_kbps": 800, "fallback_url": "https://v.redd.it/mir5lzxo9wqb1/DASH_360.mp4?source=fallback", "height": 360, "width": 626, "scrubber_media_url": "https://v.redd.it/mir5lzxo9wqb1/DASH_96.mp4", "dash_url": "https://v.redd.it/mir5lzxo9wqb1/DASHPlaylist.mpd?a=1698633443%2CYWVkMWUzY2M3ZWQwNmMxNzRkN2Q4ZWQ2ZjcxZmY5YTIwNGYxZGI5OGE1NzU1NDlhNzVmMWY3NDg4OGJmYTY2Yw%3D%3D&v=1&f=sd", "duration": 112, "hls_url": "https://v.redd.it/mir5lzxo9wqb1/HLSPlaylist.m3u8?a=1698633443%2CNTU5Y2ZkNWM2ZWM5NzhmZTlhZmVkMzY2MDQ5YTZlZjMyMDEzMzgwNmQzMTkxODVmZjkyYTBkYmU4Yzc0NGExNA%3D%3D&v=1&f=sd", "is_gif": false, "transcoding_status": "completed"}}, "score": 2813, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "comment_count": 442, "over_18": false}, "67": {"id": "16u0cpe", "locked": false, "subreddit": "aliens", "stickied": false, "category": "Aliens", "author": "dreadpirateSito", "link_flair_text": "Video", "time": 1696041445.6458519, "created_utc": 1695858764.0, "url": "https://v.redd.it/osxg2uiryvqb1", "title": "UFO\u2019s in the Bronx?", "permalink": "/r/aliens/comments/16u0cpe/ufos_in_the_bronx/", "selftext": "", "media": {"reddit_video": {"bitrate_kbps": 5000, "fallback_url": "https://v.redd.it/osxg2uiryvqb1/DASH_1080.mp4?source=fallback", "height": 1920, "width": 1080, "scrubber_media_url": "https://v.redd.it/osxg2uiryvqb1/DASH_96.mp4", "dash_url": "https://v.redd.it/osxg2uiryvqb1/DASHPlaylist.mpd?a=1698633444%2CMDBjMzc0NTUxMzZiMWE1YzU4MTYwNTFkMzdmYjgzZTdhYjdlMTA5YzEwMDA5YzBmYmY2YmE5Nzc4YTVkYTEzNA%3D%3D&v=1&f=sd", "duration": 19, "hls_url": "https://v.redd.it/osxg2uiryvqb1/HLSPlaylist.m3u8?a=1698633444%2CZDY0MWIzNmUxMzU4ZDAyNWMxMTA5NzYzMDRjZDhkMGY5Y2YxMjdlNTBjMTRiNTU3ODlmYTUwZGJhMGNmMzUxOQ%3D%3D&v=1&f=sd", "is_gif": false, "transcoding_status": "completed"}}, "score": 2689, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "comment_count": 600, "over_18": false}, "68": {"id": "16rq0cg", "locked": false, "subreddit": "uap", "stickied": false, "category": "Aliens", "author": "disclosurediaries", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1696041446.4283721, "created_utc": 1695643043.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UAP/comments/16rq0cg/a_summary_of_all_the_relevant_disclosure_updates/", "title": "A summary of all the relevant Disclosure updates from Sep 18-24", "permalink": "/r/UAP/comments/16rq0cg/a_summary_of_all_the_relevant_disclosure_updates/", "selftext": "This past week in Disclosure:\nSeptember 18th \u2013 a FOIA request on David Grusch's cleared statements raises more questions than it answers\nJohn Greenewald, who is known for submitting and publishing a constant stream of UAP-related Freedom of Information Requests (FOIA), unveiled the (heavily redacted) statements that Grusch submitted to the Defense Office of Prepublication and Security Review (DOPSR) before going public with his claims.\nThe release most notably contains a set of 10 question/answer pairs, which Grusch had prepared for review (ostensibly with his upcoming public appearances in mind). While the questions certainly align with the general gist of Grusch's claims, the answers to those questions were completely redacted. Three of the ten questions also appear to have been redacted.\nAt this time, it is not clear why questions/answers that were officially cleared for public release have been redacted so heavily for this FOIA request. An appeal will almost certainly be submitted to provide clarification.\n\u200b\nSeptember 20th \u2013 U.S. Air Force officially reports mysterious Gulf of Mexico incident to the Pentagon's UFO Offic, AARO\nThe Department of Defense officially confirmed to Liberation Times that the US Air Force has submitted a report about an incident involving an unknown object that occurred earlier this year to AARO, which is the DoD's Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) office.\nThis incident was previously introduced into the public record by Rep. Gaetz during the July 26 UAP Hearing, where he made the following statement, emphasis mine (some sections [paraphrased] for brevity):\n\n\"Several months ago my office received a protected disclosure from Eglin Air Force Base indicating that there was a UAP incident that required my attention [...] We asked to see any of the evidence that had been taken by flight crew in this endeavor and to observe any radar signature.  \n[...after initially being denied access, Gaetz was eventually shown an image from the encounter...]  \nThe image was of something that I am not able to attach to any human capability, either from the United States or from any of our adversaries*. And I'm somewhat informed on the matter, having served on the Armed Services Committee for seven years, having served on the committee that oversees DARPA and advanced technologies for several years.\"* Source, pages 41-42\n\nAARO will look to publish a public report on the incident, once cleared. A video summarising Gaetz's statements can be viewed here.\n\u200b\nSeptember 21st \u2013 NASA provides a private briefing on their UAP-related findings to Congress\nThe Oversight Committee invited NASA to conduct a bipartisan, full Committee, Member-level briefing on their findings. The briefing was closed to the public and media but additional public hearings on UAPs in the near future are anticipated to follow.\nRep. Burchett took to Twitter after the session to complain about the fact that NASA are seemingly acting \"elusive\" on the topic. NASA stated that they only explored unclassified sources during their investigations, much to the apparent frustration of Rep. Burchett amongst others.\nIt's unclear why a private briefing was necessary to brief Congress on an investigation with an unclassified scope.\n\u200b\nSeptember 22nd \u2013 US Customs and Border Patrol release a collection of UAP-related documents and videos\nThe US Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) released a variety of UAP-related documents and videos, most of which had already been circulating in the public sphere for some time. It is not clear what the specific motivation for this release was. Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, Christopher Mellon, appeared on NBC to elaborate. He used the opportunity to highlight the fact that he believes the general public is more than ready to see the full extent of various UAP-related videos the DoD has in its possession (that, to this day, have never been publicly released).\n\u200b\nSeptember 23rd \u2013 Senator Mike Rounds provides an update regarding his perspective on UAP\nIn a quick interview this week, Senator Mike Rounds (one of the co-sponsors of the UAP Disclosure Act of 2023) gives Ask a Pol a further glimpse into his thinking when asked directly to elaborate on the UAP topic:\n\u201cMy concern from the Department of Defense is, I just don't simply want our ongoing programs disrupted or limited because of additional scrutiny on what we are doing and what our adversaries are doing in some very unique programs\u201d\nRounds is quick to add: \u201cThese aren't new types of programs. They\u2019re the types of programs that have always existed, stealth is a good example.\u201d\n---\nThings to look out for in the near future:\nSeptember\n\nSteven Spielberg's production company will launch a 4 part docu-series covering UAP/UFO Encounters on Netflix on September 27th (Link)\n\nNovember\n\nThe SOL Foundation is holding its first annual conference at Stanford University on November 17-19, 2023. Covering everything from the scientific study of UAP data to philosophical questions raised by it to related global security issues, the meeting brings together Avi Loeb, Charles McCullough, Cristopher Mellon, Garry Nolan, Jacques Vall\u00e9e, and other leading academic and government voices on UAP.\n\nBeyond/currently unknown\n\nWhile the US Senate passed the NDAA for FY24 \u2013 which included the UAP Disclosure Act of 2023 as an amendment \u2013 the coming months will still require Senators and Members of Congress to reconcile the two chambers\u2019 versions of the NDAA and produce a final compromise bill. Most commentators don't expect this to happen before December 2023.\nFollowing the UAP hearing on the 26th of July, Members of Congress have called for a select committee with subpoena authority, to \u201cgo about the task of collecting information from the Pentagon and elsewhere\u201d on unidentified flying objects. There have been conflicting messages from various Members of Congress on whether this is likely to happen anytime soon.\nAccording to Senator Gillibrand \u2013 an updated UAP report from AARO can be expected by January 2024. This update was originally expected in August 2023, but faced delays.\nReps. Moskowitz, Luna, and Burchett have repeatedly stated their intent to hold field hearings to overcome stonewalling from the Pentagon and military establishment\u00a0\u2013 \"I think we [Congress] should try to get into one of these places [housing UAP evidence]...and if they won't let us in I think we should have a field hearing right outside the building...and the military will have to explain why that is.\" \u2013 Rep. Moskowitz (D). It is currently unknown when we might expect that to occur.\nSeveral journalists have indicated that first-hand witnesses of the alleged UAP legacy programs are in the process of providing testimony/evidence to the relevant authorities (e.g. the IC IG) and/or are on the verge of making public statements in the near future (Example 1, example 2, example 3)\n\nReminder \u2013\u00a0Call your Reps!\nThe House Armed Services Committee (HASC) is deliberating key UAP legislation in the next days/weeks, so I put together a list of names, emails, & numbers (+ handy scripts/templates) in one easy place. If you have the time, please do call/contact these reps & remind them sunlight is the best disinfectant! It's especially important that we voice our support for Senator Schumer/Rounds' UAP Disclosure Act legislation, which is (in my opinion) a great first step towards furthering UAP transparency as a whole.\n--------\nOther Credits (def. missing some...):\n\nRonak P\nu/Schadensfall\nu/aryelbcn\nDrDisclosure89\nRoss\nDefense Scoop\nGood trouble show\nAskapol\n", "media": null, "score": 81, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comment_count": 11, "over_18": false}, "69": {"id": "16tkaop", "locked": false, "subreddit": "unresolvedmysteries", "stickied": false, "category": "Crime", "author": "kbth7337", "link_flair_text": "Update", "time": 1696041447.7868063, "created_utc": 1695820494.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/16tkaop/update_brooks_houck_arrested_in_connection_to/", "title": "Update: Brooks Houck Arrested in Connection to Crystal Rogers Case", "permalink": "/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/16tkaop/update_brooks_houck_arrested_in_connection_to/", "selftext": "I\u2019ve posted before about updates on Crystal Rogers, who has been missing from Bardstown, KY, since 2015.

In a letter to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, the Republican lawmakers request a staff-level briefing to acquire additional information on the DOD\u2019s failed audit, financial management practices generally, and what it is doing to implement outstanding recommendations for improvement.\n\u201cThe Committee on Oversight and Accountability is investigating the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) failure to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse. In November 2022, DOD failed its fifth consecutive audit, unable to account for sixty-one percent of its $3.5 trillion in assets.

In January 2023, GAO reported that DOD failed to accurately account for much government furnished property provided to contractors including weapons, equipment, technology, and other defense articles. DOD last estimated in 2014 that contractors were in possession of $220 billion in government furnished property but GAO says that estimate is \u201csignificantly understated.\u201d GAO has also recommended several changes to DOD weapons systems acquisition, business systems modernization, and overall financial tracking.\n\u201cDOD\u2019s lax financial management and inability to adequately track weapons, equipment and other defense articles have raised serious concerns about DOD\u2019s stewardship of taxpayer dollars, especially as DOD\u2019s budget approaches thirteen figures. Failure to address these issues has limited DOD\u2019s ability to produce auditable financial statements which would enable adequate oversight of DOD\u2019s financial management practices,\u201d continued both Republican lawmakers.", "media": null, "score": 288, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comment_count": 55, "over_18": false}, "81": {"id": "16tu32l", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ufos", "stickied": false, "category": "Aliens", "author": "manwhore25", "link_flair_text": "Photo", "time": 1696041458.8414624, "created_utc": 1695844179.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/16tu32l", "title": "Bob Lazar posts 3D renderings of the craft he worked on at S4", "permalink": "/r/UFOs/comments/16tu32l/bob_lazar_posts_3d_renderings_of_the_craft_he/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 2761, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "comment_count": 630, "over_18": false}, "82": {"id": "16qf6lk", "locked": false, "subreddit": "aliens", "stickied": false, "category": "Aliens", "author": "lakerconvert", "link_flair_text": "News :illuminati:", "time": 1696041460.6258414, "created_utc": 1695502921.0, "url": "https://x.com/unexplained2020/status/1705642858240156021?s=46&t=Euzax2pfoUGaoyTHrviLrA", "title": "Gary McKinnon, who hacked into the Pentagon and NASA in search of proof of aliens, says, \"They will never tell us the truth\" in response to NASA's latest claims.", "permalink": "/r/aliens/comments/16qf6lk/gary_mckinnon_who_hacked_into_the_pentagon_and/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 2522, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "comment_count": 431, "over_18": false}, "83": {"id": "16t0neh", "locked": false, "subreddit": "uap", "stickied": false, "category": "Aliens", "author": "Just-Ad1274", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1696041461.2473865, "created_utc": 1695763769.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UAP/comments/16t0neh/do_we_have_any_real_evidence_that_these_uap_arent/", "title": "Do we have any REAL evidence that these UAP aren't just classified black budget American tech??", "permalink": "/r/UAP/comments/16t0neh/do_we_have_any_real_evidence_that_these_uap_arent/", "selftext": "Besides the US Defense's word.

Probably a similar condition exists among the sasquatch, thus explaining the action of the wild giant in this case. I should also like to add that although her present day photograph hardly bears this out, the evidence of her contemporaries goes to show that in her girlhood, Serephine Long was considered one of the most comely girls in her tribe. Here is the story:\n\"I was walking toward home one day many years ago carrying a big bundle of cedar roots and thinking of the young brave Qualac (Thunderbolt), I was soon to marry. Suddenly, at a place where the bush grew close and thick beside the trail, a long arm shot out and a big hairy hand was pressed over my mouth. Then I was suddenly lifted up into the arms of a young sasquatch. I was terrified, fought, and struggled with all my might. In those days, I was strong. But it was no good, the wild man was as powerful as a young bear. Holding me easily under one arm, with his other hand he smeared tree gum over my eyes, sticking them shut so that I could not see where he was taking me. He then lifted me to his shoulder and started to run.\nHe ran on and on for a long long time - up and down hills, through thick brush, across many streams never stopping to rest. Once he had to swim a river and then perhaps I could have gotten away, but I was so afraid of being drowned that I held on tightly with my arms about his neck. Although I was frightened I could not but admire his easy breathing, his great strength and speed of foot. After reaching the other side of the river, he began to climb and climb. Presently the air became very cold. I could not see but I guessed that we were close to the top of a mountain.\"\n\"At last the sasquatch stopped hurrying, then he stooped over and moved slowly as if feeling his way along a tunnel. Presently he laid me down very gently and I heard people talking in a strange tongue I could not understand. The young giant next wiped the sticky tree gum from my eyelids and I was able to look around me. I sat up and saw that I was in a great big cave. The floor was covered with animal skins, soft to touch and better preserved that we preserve them. A small fire in the middle of the floor gave all the light there was. As my eyes became accustomed to the gloom I saw that beside the young giant who had brought me to the cave there were two other wild people - a man and a woman. To me, a young girl, they seemed very very old, but they were active and friendly and later I learned that they were the parents of the young sasquatch who had stolen me. When they all came over to look at me I cried and asked them to let me go. They just smiled and shook their heads. From then on I was kept a close prisoner; not once would they let me go out of the cave. Always one of them stayed with me when the other two were away.\"\n\"They fed me well on roots, fish and meat. After I had learned a few words of their tongue, which is not unlike the Douglas dialect, I asked the young giant how he caught and killed the deer, mountain goats and sheep that he often brought into the cave. He smiled, opening and closing his big hairy hands. I guessed that he just laid in wait and when an animal got close enough, - he leaped, caught it and choked it to death. He was certainly big enough, quick enough and strong enough to do so.\"\n\"When I had been in the cave for about a year I began to feel very sick and weak and could not eat much. I told this to the young sasquatch and pleaded with him to take me back to my own people. At first he got very angry, as did his father and mother but I kept on pleading with them, telling them that I wished to see my own people again before I died. I really was ill and I suppose they could see that for themselves because one day after I cried for a long time, the young sasquatch went outside and returned with leaf full of tree gum. With this he stuck down my eyelids as he had done before. Then he again lifted me to his big shoulder.\"\n\"The return journey was like a very bad dream for I was light headed and in much pain. When we re-crossed the wide river, I was almost swept away; I was too weak to cling to the young sasquatch but he held me with one big hand and swam with the other. Close to my home, he put me down and gently removed the tree gum from my eyelids. When he saw that I could see again he shook his head sadly, pointed to my house and then turned back into the forest.\n\"My people were all wildly excited when I stumbled back into the house for they had long ago given me up as dead. But I was too sick and weak to talk. I just managed to crawl into bed and that night I gave birth to a child. The little one lived only a few hours, for which I have always been thankful. I hope that never again shall I see a sasquatch.\"\nThat is Serephine Long's story, the only one on record of a sasquatch ever abducting an Indian girl.
