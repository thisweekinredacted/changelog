NM, USA\nA little under 4 years ago I was working a typical shift running the register on a fairly busy food truck near a government facility. We would average 50+ customers for lunch and most were regulars, but we had a lot of new faces every day.\nOne day I get this very average looking white guy, non-descript, I couldn't pick him out in a line up. He comes to the window and asks, \"what is this?\". Unamused I tell him \"food truck, what do you want?\". He looks confused and says something along the lines of \"what do you serve on this food truck?\" I point to the sandwich board beside the window and wait. He glances at the board then asks, \"what is on a hamburger?\" like he's never heard of it before.\nI list off the regular ingredients quickly, \"burger, bun, choice of cheese, LTOP, and side of fries.\" He considers it for a moment then asks, \"what's a quesadilla?\" Some people don't know so I tell him what's in it.\nHe goes through each of the 8 or 9 items we had asking the same questions about everything. He decides on a cheeseburger and I give him the total, I think it was $12?He stares at me then hands me a $20 bill and walks away. I send the ticket to my grill and and put the change aside for when he comes back for his food. I never assume a tip unless it was mentioned as such.\nHe comes back for the food and opens the container and kinda stares at it in wonder. I offer him his change and he looks at me like he's never seen me before and walks away without his change.\nHis tone was very deliberate, like he was trying to not sound weird. The accent wasn't foreign but I couldn't pinpoint what region it was from (southern, Boston, Midwest, etc.).

I was sitting on my couch, the recliner up and I had my blanket over me because it was cold. My dog is a chihuahua and black Labrador mix, her name is Lulu. Lulu was under my blanket and laying between my legs like she normally does when I\u2019m sitting in the living room. I was watching criminal minds, the episode seven seconds and the part where Reid and Morgan were searching the girls families house. \nLulu has separation anxiety, if I leave a room, she has to follow, she doesn\u2019t like me going to the bathroom without her. And sometimes, I\u2019ll actually shut my room door when she\u2019s still in there so she\u2019ll scratch and whine at the door. Which is fine but on this particular night\u2026reminder, she\u2019s practically in my lap. It\u2019s dark in the house, because I like watching the TV in the dark, and my room door is closed, it\u2019s at the end of the hallway and I suddenly heard what sounded like Lulu whining and scratching at my door, sounded just like her,  the way her nails would sound on my door,  the way the door would shake and even the high pitched cues like she\u2019s being murdered and for a split second I thought it was her but then Lulu shot up from her spot on the couch and gets out of the blanket, she climbed onto me a little and just started growling and I got freaked out because the sound from my door is still happening. I moved my dog off me and get up. The sound stops when I stand at the end of the hallway but I still am freaked out and turned the hallway light on. I grabbed the pocket knife on the table and open my door and there is nothing in there, no marks on the door,  nothing  so I think I\u2019m going crazy but my dog, who followed me,  is still growling and on edge so I just close my room door and go back to watching criminal minds.

We were exploring tunnels close to a river/ close to Fountain Creek open space.\nWhat is up everyone? So a buddy and I had a pretty strange and utterly terrifying experience. We both enjoy Urbexing and discovered a series of underground tunnels/ like storm drains, that probably went as far as a mile and a half. Anyway, we made our way to the tunnels, got our flashlights, and my camera. We were just shooting the shit and when we got maybe half way through, the tunnel narrowed to where we were hunched over instead of being able to fully stand up. We then heard a loud scream that sounded like a lady, but not human. Overall it sounded most like a mountain lion scream/ look it up. It\u2019s a terrifying sound! After we heard this, we both froze and listened. I was shining my light down the tunnel, where I saw something pale moving towards us. I probably only saw it for like 4 seconds until I broke out of my shock and my buddy and I were running hunched over in these dark tunnels. I didn\u2019t have my camera video on, but I dropped it and sure as hell will never go back to retrieve it. I thought I was hallucinating or something, but my friend saw the exact same thing. \nThe creature we saw was unlike anything i\u2019ve ever seen. It was completely pale and looked sickly/ emaciated. The body looked somewhat human, but not quite. The face resembled that of a horse/ not as big of a snout though. Really f*g strange. If I had to compare it to anything, it would be the above image. The face especially looked like that of this particular picture of the \u201cPope lick monster.\u201d It\u2019s like if you took the head of the pope lick monster photo and placed it on the body of a deer standing on its hind legs. I suck at photo editing, so perhaps someone could photoshop something like this to get a more accurate depiction of the creature? \nI still get the chills even just thinking about this experience. My friend and I vowed to never explore tunnels again (obviously). I always thought there was no such thing as humanoid creatures until I experienced this. I enjoyed listening to like Skinwalker stories, but I always thought they were pure fiction.  A deep part of me just wants to know what it is and if it was harmful? Did we escape a potentially deadly situation? Why are not more people seeing these things? There has to be more right!? Why does no one have legit photos of humanoids? If you all have an idea of what this could\u2019ve been or if you\u2019ve had a similar experience, please share! I am utterly scared and baffled. \nUpdate 3/18/24: Hey everyone! I\u2019ve been getting a bunch of requests to pin the tunnel we went to and to go back and film. This story is 100% true. I am terrified to go back, but I do want to provide the most proof I possibly can. My buddy and I know what happened. I texted my homie about trying to find the exact location/ we\u2019ve been to so many tunnels and there are a shit ton of tunnels on the same river that goes through Fountain creek. \nUpdate 3/18/24: i have the coordinates and will be going by there probably tomorrow or Wed. Coordinates will be posted.\n38.8943519,-104.8224174\nUpdate 3/20/2024: I will be going back to the tunnel on Thurs or Fr.\nUpdate 3/21/24: I returned to the tunnel and recording the experience. I\u2019m trying to edit the gopro videos and my long Iphone introduction video/ it says it\u2019s too large to send via email, can\u2019t dropbox it, etc\u2026 Any suggestions? I edited the last two videos, but I would really like to include the first vid. I don\u2019t want to build this up too much, but something did happen. I\u2019m still shaken up. I can\u2019t wait to upload it and get your guys\u2019 thoughts? I didn\u2019t see anything, but I sure as hell heard something.

They lasted about a month and would usually consist of white water canoeing, although some of the trips were on flat water. All these trips took place in northern Ontario and Quebec, around the town of Temagami for context. The trips were part of a summer camp that focused on self reflection and testing yourself, it was the same group of guys year after year for 9 years. The final trip I did when I was 19 took us over 300 miles down the Harricana river which splits between Quebec and Ontario. It is very remote. We would pass an off grid hunting cabin every few days where we would use the water tank to replenish our water bags.\nThere were no roads and only the occasional snow mobile trail for hundreds of miles. The goal of the trip was to take this great river to the mouth of the James bay, which is connected to the Hudson Bay, we would then paddle across the open bay, about 60 miles of open water, to a sand bar where we would spend the night. Before continuing to the remote indigenous town of Moosonee ON. Before we got to the open bay we were camping on marshland. Due to the tides we had a unique sleep schedule, we would fall asleep in our tents by 10 PM to wake up at 3 AM to catch the tide. It was about 11 PM and I was sitting crouched on my heels on the river bank watching the moon and listening to the waterfowl. \nAs I was sitting there a shiny cylindric object about the size of a paper towel roll with rounded ends shot past me about 20 feet to my left, the opposite direction of where the tents were. It plunged down into the river before shooting back out a few hundred feet down stream. It instantly accelerated to the speed of sound and vanished creating a sonic boom. \nPeople started coming out of their tents curious about the noise. I told them it was probably a hunter in the area. For reference this happened in 2012, and a few years ago I told my friends this over some drinks and they understandably thought I was joking. I know what I saw, and it was the only time I have ever heard the sound barrier broken.

Anywho I just came across this image and basically shit my pants. If you rounded the chin out and gave this lady a bowl cut It's basically an exact match to those two ladies in my experience. It's truly uncanny. The complexion, the odd proportions of the eyes, even the nose shape is nearly identical.   \nThose fucking eyes man\nWell I reverse searched the image and it appears it was originally produced by a photoshop artist back in 2014 or so. The earliest page i can find where the image actually appears was for a blogspot collating \"Manga style\" photography. Later iterations of it has it presented by UFO enthusiasts as a legitimate mock-up for a \"Pleiadean\". I've seen no evidence that this was the original artists intention so I'm assuming the saucer folks thought it looked close to their experiences and just slapped the label on it, go figure. \nOrigins aside, it still looks scarily similar to the ladies I saw and It's very weird that this fictitious piece of art looks so close. Now that that I have a reference point I thought it wouldn't hurt to ask if any of you here might have seen anyone strange that looked similar to this? Maybe the original artist met a similar person and that's what inspired them to make this piece?

I have sensed passing deaths.\nExperience #1. My Grandmother in law was visiting us and we shared a \u2018looking moment\u2019. She looked at me, upon leaving to go back home, as if to say, \u2018This is the last visit you and I will have on Earth.\u2019 I acknowledged her look with my own thought, \u2018I know and I understand\u2019. The whole situation reminded me of the scene in \u2018The Shining\u2019 with Dick Hallorann and Danny Torrance looking at each other and having their telepathic conversation. Months later her cancer took over and she lost her battle with it in hospice. That last visit at our house was indeed, the last visit on Earth I had with her.\nExperience #2. I was out running errands and I had this fleeting (but strong) thought to call an old friend. It felt as if she just needed to be reached out to. Later that evening, after not following through with the phone call, I was scrolling on Facebook and learned she had to put her beloved 9 year old Golden Retriever down earlier that day. And then I called her.\nExperience #3. A family member suddenly took a turn for the worse and was in the hospital. After some time we learned that he was transferred to hospice. That evening, while grocery shopping, I felt a sensation; I do not know how to describe it other than it was a very strong, very distinct, very profound shift of internal energy and perspective of external energy. Literally, after 30-45 minutes of that sensation passing, I received a text from my husband that that family member had passed.\nI have had more of these experiences but these are the most memorable.\nThank You for reading.", "media": null, "score": 21, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "comment_count": 4, "over_18": false}, "43": {"id": "1bgqmzs", "locked": false, "subreddit": "threekings", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "3rroR039", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1711164881.8061738, "created_utc": 1710655294.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/threekings/comments/1bgqmzs/i_have_to_ask/", "title": "I have to ask", "permalink": "/r/threekings/comments/1bgqmzs/i_have_to_ask/", "selftext": "Hey are there any rituals games to do to invite a spirit for lewd activities because just saw a post on 4 chan now im curius.", "media": null, "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "comment_count": 8, "over_18": false}, "44": {"id": "1bgzovi", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ghosts", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Blackshadowteam", "link_flair_text": "Is this undeniable evidence?", "time": 1711164882.6047032, "created_utc": 1710687857.0, "url": "https://v.redd.it/20f8hph9twoc1", "title": "Door closes at Indiana State Sanatorium and we almost missed it", "permalink": "/r/Ghosts/comments/1bgzovi/door_closes_at_indiana_state_sanatorium_and_we/", "selftext": "My team and I kicked off our tour at the Indiana state sanatorium February 2023 and started off with a decent catch, we managed to capture a door close behind the glass double doors.

I promptly asked Pentagon press officer Susan Gough to release a copy to me, but Gough replied, \"I cannot provide a copy of the message to you, as it contains information that\u2019s not publicly releasable.\" \nOn August 31, 2023, I filed a FOIA request for the GENADMIN message. The Department of Defense Freedom of Information Division has now released the 9-page document to me (response letter dated March 15, 2024, received by me on March 18), with only minimal redactions. After redacting my personal information, I am now making the complete FOIA release available at the link below. (The image merely shows the first page of the document; click on the link to download the complete PDF.)\nINITIAL OBSERVATIONS\nAmong the noteworthy aspects I see in the May 2023 Joint Staff communication:\n-- An introductory paragraph states: \"The U.S. government has observed UAP in or near the territory and/or operating areas of the United States, of its allies, and of its adversaries, and observing, identifying, and potentially mitigating UAP has become a growing priority for US policymakers, lawmakers, and warfighters. The potentially ubiquitous presence of UAP defines the national security implications of those anomalies, which range from operational hazards and threats to technological and intelligence surprise to adversaries' strategic miscalculations. It is imperative that DoD provide UAP incident, incursion, and engagement...reporting, data, and material for the Department's detection and mitigation of potential threats; exploitation of advanced technologies; and informing policymaker and warfighter decisions.\"\n--Reports on UAP incidents are to be transmitted upwards with 96 hours, but any \"UAP engagement reports\" within 12 hours. A \"UAP engagement is a kinetic or non-kinetic response to a UAP, intended to deny, disrupt, or destroy the phenomenon and/or its object(s).\" \n-- The ultimate nexus of collection and analysis of these reports is the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO).\n--  The reporting procedures in the Joint Staff message apply only to detections or encounters \"that demonstrate behaviors not readily understood by sensors or observers...[that] include but are not limited to phenomena that demonstrate apparent capabilities or material that exceed known performance envelopes.\" The UAP reporting procedures described in this directive do NOT apply to \"incidents, incursions, and engagements by identifiable, non-anomalous phenomena (e.g., sUAS and other capabilities or materials that do not exceed known or predicted performance envelopes);\" such incidents will instead \"continue to be reported through established processes and mechanisms.\"\n-- The reporting matrix seeks 11 categories of information-- among these, any UAP-displayed \"anomalous characteristics/behaviors (e.g., no apparent control surfaces, extreme acceleration/direction change, detection by certain sensors but not others),\" and any \"UAP effects on equipment (e.g., mechanical, electrical controls and weapons systems and whether persistent or transitory\").\n-- AARO will coordinate the handling of any UAP \"objects and material of incidents, intrusions, and engagements,\" but \"recovery and transfer of identifiable, non-anomalous items of foreign origin...continue to be managed by the DoD FMP [Foreign Material Program].\"\n-- The military commands are to \"enable deployment of special sensors within the AoR [area of responsibility] for the detection, observation, and identification in sensitive areas, and during testing or deployment of special capabilities.\"\nADDITIONAL CONTEXT\nOn its website, AARO calls the military reporting system defined in the May 2023 GENADMIN \"Current Operational UAP Reporting.\" In a briefing for selected journalists on March 6, 2024, AARO Acting Director Tim Phillips said that AARO is receiving \"approximately...anywhere between 90 and a 100-110 a month\" through such channels. \nPhillips also told the journalists, \"We're trying to work out the command and control, the mechanisms on how other government entities can report UAP incidents to us. We've received a number of reports from Department of Homeland Security and their aircraft reporting to us that we follow up on.\" \nAs for civilian pilots, the AARO website states, \"AARO receives UAP-related Pilot Reports (PIREPs) from the Federal Aviation Administration.\"\nThe UAP reporting system for contemporary military-associated UAP events, as set forth in the May 2023 Joint Staff message, is separate and distinct from the AARO \"secure reporting\" system for receiving reports \"from current or former U.S. Government employees, service members, or contractor personnel with direct knowledge of U.S. Government programs or activities related to UAP dating back to 1945,\" which is accessible through a portal on the AARO website. \nAARO does not yet employ any system for receiving UAP observation reports from the general public. \nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1iEj-a-fuJjpwKOWbP3xxsOmQYmbA7DK-/view?usp=sharing", "media": null, "score": 83, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comment_count": 6, "over_18": false}, "50": {"id": "1bhklbq", "locked": false, "subreddit": "conspiracy", "stickied": false, "category": "Consipiracy", "author": "Gobblemegood", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1711164889.0823064, "created_utc": 1710745167.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1bhklbq", "title": "Kate Middleton spotted with no evidence and UK media showing an old photo from last year!!", "permalink": "/r/conspiracy/comments/1bhklbq/kate_middleton_spotted_with_no_evidence_and_uk/", "selftext": "Kate Middleton has reportedly been spotted in public for the first time since her surgery and the photoshop scandal, however the moment was not caught on camera!

If I continued riding, I\u2019d end up in Camp Robinson, at the time a military ground they used for practice. \nSaying all that, I never saw a human or anyone practicing any military routine.\nBut, I was very used to the sound of the crackling branches, little animals scurrying about and the echo of my horses hoofs breaking twigs.\nThis event happened several times and even seemed to follow me hundreds of miles when my parents moved us to Northwest Arkansas in the Ozarks.\nI would be riding in the daytime- midday and hear a huge footfall, like the heaviest sounding footstep ever that would be almost in time with my horses stride. So, I\u2019d stop quickly and listen and it would stop but a moment later so that I\u2019d hear that last footstep.\nI even galloped the horse several times and it would keep pace, but when I stopped abruptly I\u2019d hear a couple quick footfalls behind me. It terrified me.\nIt\u2019s weird because my ears would prick like a dogs, and I\u2019d hear nothing else in the forest.\nNo birds were chirping or even Turkey buzzards flying around.\nThe worst was once we moved to strickler Arkansas. Our 240 acres butted up to the National Forest. If I\u2019d been riding all day and was making it home late I\u2019d stick to the dirt road as the light of the sun grew dimmer. I\u2019d hear those same heavy footsteps in the woods along the road. It\u2019s unexplainable the chills that ran up my spine. I was a seasoned outdoorsman by this time and went hiking as well, 1978-83.\nIt never happened in the winter that I remember. \nI didn\u2019t see anything at the times listed but it was more than obvious I was being stalked by something that was heavy enough to hear over the sound of my horses four hooves and the leather saddle.

Nail the mirror to the door so  the door opens up to you and you can see the mirror yourself with reflection. Make sure all the nails and stuff are playing towards you this is important later and that the door opens towards you All right Make a ring of salt around the now portal that you're going to be using. Put the three candles inside doing your salt around the door one on the right side put the white candle on the left side put the black candle and a central rail you're going to open the door but decently far away I put the gray candle then here comes the metals put the silver item near the near the white candle preferably in it or around it same with gold and the black candle and of course your copper item is with the gray candle then you need to pick your finger or I don't know get some blood on items and in the candle flames this will bite you and stop the ritual you need to make sure there's enough room for you to open and close the door this is very important you don't want to think coming out then you need to chant these words or chant them 13 times \"Take me to where I want to go, take me away from my troubles and toils, take me somewhere new and great\" now you need to be careful close your eyes and imaginan your new realm just be careful when you feel something has changed in the room and the door will start glowing open it slowly very slowly Don't want to go campers you should see the realm that you want Walk through it but keep the door open something will try to get out eventually you can explore this new room as long as you like but don't do it too long there is only so much time you can spend to you sure you can stay forever but then there's no way back when you think you've gone what you needed Go back to the portal and close the door blow out the candles start with a grey, gold and silver.
