I am now obsessed with reading people's stories or anything new that has been posted about these things specifically.\nHere is my story to share with all you open-minded folk. \nFirst of all, here is a little bit about the area it happened in...\nI live just off The Isle of Skye in Scotland. In the village where i live, there's 2 bridges linking the mainland to Skye. Between the bridges is a wee island that has a lighthouse and 2 cottages going back hundreds of years (famously gavin maxwell resided in one of them). Anyway, there's always been a lot of folklore around the lighthouse. Everyone who has worked there over the centuries has always said the same story. Which is that they heard loud voices calling loudly outside the building and a massive change in atmosphere... but none of the workers who  stayed there (from countries all over the world mind) could ever identify where exactly it was coming from or understand what the language was... nor did they see who or what was calling out... Regardless of this, I don't know if perhaps my experience is linked to the folklore, but It happened in the exact same area, which for me personally made my encounter all the more creepy.\nThe encounter....\nOne night in the spring of 2019, i was running the Skye bridge after work at around 9 pm. I stopped to take rest on the first smaller bridge between the cottages and the mainland. The bridge was in complete darkenss and i was using my torch to see where i was going. I leaned on the barrier to catch my breath, looking out over the moon lit loch. When I  turned my head and looked in the direction of the distant  street lights about 100 metres or so away... i was utterly stunned!  The hairs stood up all over me, and my nerves were shot to pieces. I locked my eyes on what seemed to be a 12-foot giant blurry stick figure cross the road. Almost the height of the street lights. It had no features other then see through shades of dark blue and black. Its legs and arms were the same long, thin shape of its body, as was its tall, featurless squeared head. What's more disturbing is the millisecond I saw it I felt an overwhelming feeling of vulnerability and dread. It was a dramatic change in the air and a very terrible atmosphere.\nThe scariest part for me was that when i watched this thing cross the road from the right side of the road (my side)  to left... It took long, smooth, slow strides and didn't seem to make contact with the ground. It glided with its steps... when it reached the other side, it went through the stone wall that follows along the road, into the blackness, and then instantly reappaeared back on my side. It then proceeded to cross the road over and over. This happened  around 5 times until it never reappeared. This is the only thing  I've ever witnessed in my life I can not explain, and it utterly shocked me to my core, and now I really am just mesmerised. There really are weird things going on in the world.\nSince that day, im very nervous about going through there.  It' always in the  back of my mind even when I  drive to work in daylight. \nPlease, if anyone on here has had a similar experience, please contact me. \n I had never even heard of anything like this before... not everln bloody slender man... then I find online that people have had  incredibly similar experiences to me. That made it crystal clear in my mind that i really had seen something, and it can't be a coincidence.  I've been fascinated ever since! \nThank you. \nThe Bridge & Lighthouse", "media": null, "score": 45, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "comment_count": 24, "over_18": false}, "10": {"id": "1dgrvro", "locked": false, "subreddit": "cryptids", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "Remarkable_Act1048", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1719024077.868563, "created_utc": 1718486303.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/i4gui492ys6d1.jpeg", "title": "Wendigo", "permalink": "/r/cryptids/comments/1dgrvro/wendigo/", "selftext": "The Wendigo is my favorite cryptid (any opinions)", "media": null, "score": 704, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "comment_count": 116, "over_18": false}, "11": {"id": "1dgm20k", "locked": false, "subreddit": "thetruthishere", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Ysulyan", "link_flair_text": "Lights/Glows", "time": 1719024078.0110765, "created_utc": 1718469789.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1dgm20k/roughly_20_years_later_still_trying_to_find_out/", "title": "Roughly 20 years later, still trying to find out what caused these.", "permalink": "/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1dgm20k/roughly_20_years_later_still_trying_to_find_out/", "selftext": "I was going to post this on r/dreams but then realized I wasn't technically dreaming when experiencing this.\nAround the age of 8 I'd wake up in the middle of the night in my room and see things on the floor that emitted a eery white glow. It creeped me out because I was fully conscious while witnessing them. It was no moonlight because we had roller shutters that completely blocked off light and the fact that these happened across the span of several months makes me determine they happened during new moons and cloudy nights too. This was back in like the late 90s so I didn't even have a means to take pictures or anything as I didn't own a mobile phone until I was in my mid teens, so I can't share proof. And I was too scared to prod or even get close to them or look at them for a long time.\nIt would happen every other day and always for no apparent reason. The lights had abstract shapes and never really made sense and despite them never moving or doing anything, they'd never be in the same place or have the same shapes as the ones preceding or superseding them; one night they might be next to my bed, the other night by the door.\nWhat's more disturbing is one night I'd wake my brother up, who slept on a bed next to mine, and ask him if he could see what I was seeing and he would say he didn't. And these were not dreams because up to this day me, my mom and brother still recall the time in which I had these weird apparitions in the night because I'd always nag at them and talk to them about them.\nThe worst part is that one day I asked my brother to turn on the lights which caused the glow to disappear but as soon as he turned off the lights the glow would return to the floor.\nEventually I learned to ignore it and the glows never returned although they were soon replaced by sleep paralysis and later on in life other disturbing yet normal nightmares.", "media": null, "score": 56, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "comment_count": 15, "over_18": false}, "12": {"id": "1dhuy84", "locked": false, "subreddit": "letsnotmeet", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Formal-River-9239", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1719024078.162584, "created_utc": 1718620531.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1dhuy84/my_kidnappers/", "title": "My kidnappers.", "permalink": "/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1dhuy84/my_kidnappers/", "selftext": "It was the summer of 1978 and we had just moved from Canada to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. As a seven year old child I was excited about moving to a new country and the adventures that awaited me. I had no idea that one of my first adventures would be so sinister.\nWe end up staying at the Hilton hotel with other expat families while we waited for the company supplied home to be ready for us to move into. As a 2nd grader staying in a hotel for one-two weeks was exciting and seemed like a camping trip spent in luxury.  Since other expat families were also staying at the hotel I had lots of other children to play with. One of the games we would play was hide n' seek - this meant using the elevator to hide out on the other 30 some floors or in the stairwells. The hotel gave us children a false sense of security.\nOne day when we were playing 'hide n' seek' I took the elevator alone to the top floor in the building, I believe it was the 30th floor, and exited the elevator. As I rounded the corner from the bank of elevators I ran into a man and woman. They looked to be in their 30s and looked native to the country. I recall they did not look frightening and were dressed nicely. While they looked normal their actions immediately said something different.\nThe man tried to grab my arm and I pulled away. I immediately backed away from the couple till we were standing about ten-fifteen feet apart. I of course was on the edge of turning and running, but understood that I had no where to run to if a pursuit did occur. A short lived stand off ensued. I assumed the man wanted to convince me to come with them willingly because if I screamed it could attract the attention of other guests staying on that floor. So from fifteen apart we stared each other down.\nI was standing closest to the bank of elevators and they were standing between me and the stairwell. The man took a chocolate bar out of his pocket and held it out to me. This of course would mean approaching the couple to take it and there was no way in hell I was going to do that. The man and woman were staring at me with creepy fake smiles and I could see that their body positioning screamed 'we may lunge at you at any moment'.\nAs a side note I remember the chocolate bar had nuts in it and I hated nuts in chocolate bars. When it was clear that I wasn't going to come to them I could see the man's stance start to change into 'I am about to lunge at you' and my stance changed to 'I think its time to run'. Right when it looked like the man was going to lunge at me the elevator doors dinged and someone got off on that floor.\nI don't remember who it was or what they looked like because as soon as I heard that sound I turned and bolted past that person and into the open elevator doors. I recall that the man and woman retreated in the opposite direction at that sound, maybe to their room or to the stairwell.\nI never told anyone what had happened till decades later and as a child quickly pushed it to the back of my mind till I was much older.\nIt is sobering how the smallest things in life can be so life changing. I don't remember who got off on that floor but I remain eternally grateful to them, and to that couple I say lets not meet again.", "media": null, "score": 93, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "comment_count": 8, "over_18": true}, "13": {"id": "1dgh3dr", "locked": false, "subreddit": "threekings", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Thefemcelbreederfan", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1719024078.3527663, "created_utc": 1718455242.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/threekings/comments/1dgh3dr/any_beginner_rituals_that_can_improve_my_skill/", "title": "Any beginner rituals that can improve my skill?

Upon reaching the Las Chapas Wilderness, Castillo overtook his companion and remained at a close distance. Around 22:00, and some 10-15 Km after Las Plumas, in the Los Altares Valley, Castillo was startled to see a small light in the sky through the windshield: it increased in magnitude, toward the right and running distantly to the left.\nAs the source of silvery light grew in intensity, Castillo\u2019s disquiet toward the phenomenon also rose. He decided to stop and consult with Giannoni about the observation, who unhesitatingly tells him it is a \u201cflying saucer\u201d\nThe shocking presence of the UFO: After filling up, the headed to the restaurant of the Automovil Club hostelry, where they state having eaten fish and consumed some cold sodas. Feeling considerably more tranquil, they discussed their experience with the person running the location \u2013 which we have been able to confirm \u2013 and renewed their journey at 02:15 in the morning. They would stop every so often along the road, chatting a while to keep from falling asleep and staying close to each other at a 30 meter distance. Giannoni was up ahead until he stopped at a given point, complaining of a headache, and saying he could go no further. Castillo replied that he would go ahead, as they were very near their destination. At that time, he was about to get down from the pickup truck when both men witnessed an object measuring 3 meters in diameter with an intense white, phosphorescent light that appeared to emit a sound similar to that of a teletype machine (\u201cbeep-beep-beep\u201d). The object was suspended one meter above the ground and some 10 meters from the startled witnesses. Upon seeing this portent, Jorge Castillo entered the pickup truck while Alfredo Gianonni \u2013 still drowsy and feeling the headache \u2013 managed to quickly pull away from the site.\nIt was then that UFO rose into the air, making itself plainly visible in a matter of seconds. Castillo, stepping on the gas, managed to catch up with his traveling companion.\nThe strange occupants: In these conditions, a startled Jorge Castillo looked through his rear view mirror and saw \u201ca thing with many lights and two square things in the rear of the pickup truck\u201d where he carried four drums of ink for the Esquel newspaper in the city of the same name.\nAfter having driven some 10 kilometers and around 3 in the morning, near Pampa de Agnia \u2013 a locality that only appears on the map \u2013 Castillo looked through the mirror again and saw four \u201csquare\u201d figures in the payload that appeared to be \u201clooking\u201d at the drums. He continued driving nervously, glancing at the figures without stopping. According to one version of the story (2), upon delivering the ink, operators found it to be much more fluid than previous deliveries from the same factory and lot number.\nThey had covered another 15 kilometers prior to going up a long, steep rise when Giannoni, who was following closely but without seeing anything odd, said he was going to stay behind, as he was fatigued. Curiously enough, Castillo said that he could still see the humanoid figures through the mirror as well as an oval grey cloud that appeared to follow him on the side. Nonetheless, the witness gave the impression of contradicting himself when he points out Giannoni\u2019s location with regard to his own. It is necessary to add here that at no point did Giannoni see or become aware of the presence of the alleged occupants, despite the fact that they shouted to each other from within the cabs of their pickup trucks, driving close together along the road.\nWhen he saw those figures, Castillo was driving at some 70 Kmh (bear in mind that the vehicles were in a break-in period) and when he turned on the cabin lights to see if the beings were still behind him, since the sight couldn\u2019t be clear, he noticed to his surprise that there was nothing there, just the four ink drums. However, when he turned off the light, he could see them once more.\nView of the mountains: Alfredo Giannoni could go no further and decided to stop a while to sleep. Castillo, on the other hand, chose to continue the trip with great fear. Upon reaching a steep rise, he noticed that \u201cthe mountains on the side of the road joined as if they were made of rubber \u2013 they joined together and shut the road before me. Perhaps I was ill and grabbing my head, I stopped and thought: do I go through or not go through, will they take me away or not take me away\u2026\u201d However, moments after turning off his lights, the mountains returned to their rightful places. Suddenly, he sees two humanoids approaching him swiftly, walking along the desolate Patagonian road. They were a meter and a half tall, looking like astronauts in white outfits. Upon seeing them, he turned on the lights again and the disquieting vision vanished. He figures that it lasted barely a second.\nFacing this circumstance, he tried in vain to go and find Giannoni, as he was exhausted and with a pounding headache, and pain in his arm. His pickup truck was diagonally across the road, with all of its lights on. He tumbled onto the seat, covering himself with some rugs he carried as samples, allowing an indefinite period of time to go by. Giannoni appeared out of nowhere, urging him to continue the trip. Traveling at 80 kmh, Castillo was some 10 to 20 meters behind, all the time seeing the mysterious cloudy object through his rear view mirror.\nAn unusual turn of events? : With less than 60 km to reach Esquel, in the vicinity of the Tecka River, Giannoni\u2019s pickup truck \u201cslid on the shoulder and went up in the air, landing in a very deep ditch,\u201d according to the description given by Castillo, who did not hesitate in ascribing it to the strange phenomenon he was seeing, adding that the vehicle \u201cwas lifted from the front, without overturning any cement barriers, passing over them as though lifted. Furthermore, there\u2019s nothing broken on it. Just a dented roof, as if they\u2019d lifted it and turned it around.\u201d Giannoni rested against the steering wheel, and while somewhat bruised and with a clamped leg, he exclaimed that he was okay. Castillo then got down rendering assistance and getting the motor going again with the lights on. He brought his companion back to his own pickup and they arrived in that vehicle, reaching Esquel after 6 in the morning.\nSource :https://inexplicata.blogspot.com/2013/11/argentina-humanoids-at-pampa-de-agnia.html?m=1", "media": null, "score": 38, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "comment_count": 6, "over_18": false}, "25": {"id": "1diha2f", "locked": false, "subreddit": "cryptids", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "McDirken_Dirkenstein", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1719024086.6692903, "created_utc": 1718682144.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/c4v0kawe497d1.jpeg", "title": "Listen just tell me I\u2019m crazy.", "permalink": "/r/cryptids/comments/1diha2f/listen_just_tell_me_im_crazy/", "selftext": "I have heard weird stuff around my house my entire life at night, things scratching on the screen on the second floor, bangs on the door , cats freaking out for no apparent reason.

Concurrently, both were lifted out of their bodies and, along with others, entered a huge round amphitheater-like enclosure. They were greeted by tall, robed human-looking entities. They found themselves on a high walkway that surrounded the enclosure. Bob was separated from Betty. He was told that he was not as spiritually advanced as Betty and was held to wait for her. During that time he received answers to many questions that he asked an alien who guarded him. Betty, on the other hand, was allowed to participate with a number of light beings in a fantastic procedure that changed her and them into balls of light and back to their light- being form.\n(snip)\nThe craft returned to earth. Betty was placed back into the blue- glowing orb, which descended to the ground just outside the trailer. She entered and went to the bedroom where Bob was sleeping. She was shocked to the core when she saw her physical body in bed before she entered it. Betty had no idea how her physical body got back to the trailer while she was still in an OBE state of being.\n******************\nFrom the book The Source Field Investigations by David Wilcock:\nThe DNA Phantom Effect\nNow I want to jump ahead in time to 1984, because this was the year our \u201caddiction\u201d to DNA was heavily challenged, if not defeated, by Dr. Peter Gariaev. Gariaev\u2019s discovery also gave us a compelling hint that Gurwitsch\u2019s mitogenetic radiation\u2014the Source Field\u2014may well be operating through our DNA. Furthermore, Gariaev\u2019s discovery suggests that the complete genetic codes for an organism might not actually be found in the DNA molecule after all\u2014at least not as their final location. When Gariaev put a sample of DNA in a tiny quartz container, zapped it with a mild laser, and then observed it with sensitive equipment that could detect even single photons of light, he found that the DNA acted like a light sponge. Somehow, the DNA molecule absorbed all the photons of light in the area, and actually stored them in a corkscrew-shaped spiral.7 This is very, very strange. The DNA apparently created a vortex of some sort that attracted the light, not unlike the idea of a black hole\u2014but on a much, much smaller scale.\n(snip)\nDr. Peter Gariaev\u2019s DNA Phantom Effect proved that the DNA molecule captures and stores light. A mysterious force holds the light in the same place for up to 30 days after the DNA molecule itself has been removed from the area.\n(snip)\nWhatever was holding that light in place, it did not need the DNA molecule at all. It was something else. Something invisible. Something powerful enough to store and control visible light within the shape of the DNA molecule itself. The only rational, scientific explanation is that there has to be an energy field that is paired up with the DNA molecule\u2014as if DNA has an energetic \u201cduplicate.\u201d This duplicate has the same shape as the physical molecule\u2014but once we move the DNA, the duplicate still hangs around in the same spot the molecule was in before. It doesn\u2019t need the DNA molecule to be there in order for it to keep on doing its job\u2014storing visible light. Some force, perhaps akin to gravity, is holding the photons in place.\n(snip)\nThe implications of this are mind-boggling. Obviously, in the case of a human body we have far more than one DNA molecule to consider\u2014we have untold trillions of them, in a very highly structured arrangement. We have bone DNA, organ DNA, blood DNA, muscle DNA, tendon DNA, skin DNA, nervous-system DNA and brain DNA. So, just by a simple extension of Gariaev\u2019s experiment, it is very likely that our entire body must have an energetic duplicate. This fits in perfectly with what Driesch, Gurwitsch, Burr and Becker all theorized and observed\u2014there is an information field that tells our cells what to do, and where to do it. Once we add Gariaev\u2019s discovery in, we find out that perhaps the most important thing the DNA molecule does is store light\u2014both in our physical body and in our energetic duplicate body as well.\n(snip)\nHowever, it does fit in very nicely with what we\u2019ve been calling the Source Field. On a microbiological level, it appears that we have an energetic duplicate. Our DNA is somehow interfacing with an energy field that has remained largely unknown to Western scientists, and which leaves behind a phantom that can easily be measured.\n(snip)\nIt\u2019s like a perfect hologram of your physical body\u2014which is correct down to the tiniest cell.\n(snip)\nIn 1907, as published in the American Medicine journal, Dr. Duncan MacDougall found that his patients suddenly lost a little over one ounce of weight directly after their physical death. In these studies, the patients were kept on beds within a metallic basin that would catch any bodily fluids. The air they exhaled from their lungs upon death did not weigh anywhere near one ounce\u2014nonetheless, the weight loss remained consistent in every case.\nIn 1975, Dr. Hereward Carrington and associates found that the average person would lose two and a quarter ounces of weight while they were having an out-of-body experience. When they returned to the body, the missing mass immediately returned. It appears there is an \u201cenergetic\u201d component of our bodies that may be withdrawing from each and every cell, and projecting to other locations\u2014 either at death, when remote viewing or when having an out-of-body experience.\n*************\nEdit: add link to \"Body of Light\" Wikipedia entry below.\nBody of light - Wikipedia", "media": null, "score": 1196, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "comment_count": 504, "over_18": false}, "34": {"id": "1dhr8is", "locked": false, "subreddit": "uap", "stickied": false, "category": "Aliens", "author": "ufoarchivist", "link_flair_text": "Video", "time": 1719024092.4928448, "created_utc": 1718604616.0, "url": "https://youtu.be/K-xKex5-_Qc", "title": "Paul Hellyer testifying at the Citizen Hearing on UFO Disclosure in Washington, D.C.", "permalink": "/r/UAP/comments/1dhr8is/paul_hellyer_testifying_at_the_citizen_hearing_on/", "selftext": "", "media": {"type": "youtube.com", "oembed": {"provider_url": "https://www.youtube.com/", "version": "1.0", "title": "Paul Hellyer testifying at the Citizen Hearing on UFO Disclosure in Washington, D.C.", "type": "video", "thumbnail_width": 480, "height": 200, "width": 267, "html": "<iframe width=\"267\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/K-xKex5-_Qc?feature=oembed&enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen title=\"Paul Hellyer testifying at the Citizen Hearing on UFO Disclosure in Washington, D.C.\"></iframe>", "author_name": "UFO Archives", "provider_name": "YouTube", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K-xKex5-_Qc/hqdefault.jpg", "thumbnail_height": 360, "author_url": "https://www.youtube.com/@UFOArchivist"}}, "score": 44, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "comment_count": 4, "over_18": false}, "35": {"id": "1dkm52i", "locked": false, "subreddit": "conspiracy", "stickied": false, "category": "Consipiracy", "author": "FreedomVegan", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1719024093.5604596, "created_utc": 1718916616.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/t6gzf26mhs7d1.jpeg", "title": "In case anyone forgot\u2026", "permalink": "/r/conspiracy/comments/1dkm52i/in_case_anyone_forgot/", "selftext": "Gaslighting 101 - also associate any skepticism with Q anon\u2026 mainstream media is just a tool for ruling class.

Normal teenage boy angst. I'm as British as beans on toast, so this was a very new experience. My dad lived near the airport in Joburg. And he was often away for work. So I basically lived alone for long stretches. The shortest was a month, , the longest was three months. \nI essentially did my own shopping and what one would consider mild cooking. I couldn't drive yet, so I walked everywhere. And my dad didn't give me many rules. Just one really. Don't go out alone at night.\nHe didn't mean in our yard, because we lived in a gated community. And there was a security guard at the front. He meant out out. The neighbourhood was different after dark. The nights weren't safe. Robbers, he said. I heard him, but I didn't take it seriously. \nIt used to get really dark by 6pm. It was darker than any night I'd ever encountered in London. Without the street lamps it would have been pure black. One evening, around 7pm, I decided I wanted crisps. Potato chips, to my esteemed American friends. I was home alone, and had been for two weeks. And I was bored. So I broke the only rule I had. \nEven the security guard tried to stop me, when I told him I was going out. He told me he'd buy them for me after his shift in an hour, but I was nearly 19, 6 foot tall, built like a rake with shoulders, no fighting experience at all, but full of bravado. I wasn't scared. \nThe road from my dad's house was brightly lit. The store was about a mile away. But there was an avenue you had to walk through that had loads of trees and no lighting. Pitch black.  There was a cold wind blowing. The sounds of insects and birds felt magnified. And that's when I heard the footsteps. \nI looked back and around, but I couldn't see anyone. So I kept walking. Telling myself I was imagining things. I walked a bit more. Then I heard them again. Footsteps, but again I couldn't see anyone. \nThere was the road, where I was, and then a path on the side lined with trees. I was in the middle of the road because I'd convinced myself it was safer. And I realised the person wasn't in the road, they were on the path. \nI kept walking. Faster this time. Singing loudly. I was convinced I was imagining it, but the footsteps continued. I was feeling more and more frightened. So to assure myself I was just imagining it, I stopped, and turned on the torch on my phone, then pointed it at the path.\nPeeking from behind a tree was a man. He was maybe around 30, and he was watching me. I swear he had something in his hand. I'm not sure if he did. But in my mind, I saw what looked like a knife. \nI turned around and just ran back home. I didn't bother listening for anything. I just ran back as fast as I could. I couldn't breathe, and my chest was on fire. The security guard heard me and had the gate open even before I arrived. He looked at me with a knowing. As I panted, trying to catch my breath. \nHe never asked me about it. But I know he knew what had happened. I never saw the man again, and I don't know what would have happened. I also didn't tell my dad or anyone for that matter. \nThe security guard, got me the crisps, if you're wondering. And for the rest of the year I stayed there, I never went walking alone at night again.

Please do not handle similar situations the way I did. \nIt began the summer before I entered high school (2018) with innocent messages on Facebook. I never understood why he continued to message me. After a couple of days of him texting 6-7 times in a row (without reply), he stated that he was 26, from my hometown but stationed elsewhere in the army, and had plans to find a young wife to cherish. I made it clear that I was 14 and uninterested, then blocked his account. The next day, he made another account, calling me \"babygirl\" and telling me that I was what he wanted in a wife. This wasn't the first time I had dealt with an older man interested in me, naively, I muted the chat and moved on with my life.\nI stopped thinking about him, enjoyed my summer, and then started high school. Everything was going great until the packages started to arrive. First, a necklace with his name on it, then one shaped like a heart. They had receipts and were expensive. I was terrified that he had found my address, so I showed my mom everything. My mom tried to return the gifts (not sure why that was her reaction), but he refused. Showing my mom the messages was the first time I had actually read any of them. They were weird, and some were about eloping with me when I turned 16.\nMy mom found out that he went to high school with both of my older siblings. My sister recalled him as a weird anime nerd, and he was friendly towards my brother, also an anime nerd. I ended up blocking a few more accounts and tried to ignore what I thought wasn\u2019t that serious of a situation. After this we never spoke of him again.\nOne afternoon in November of my freshman year, I was in gym class with friends when I received a call with no ID. My friends told me to pick up, thinking it was a telemarketer or spam that we could mess with. We all heard something along the lines of, \"I\u2019m waiting outside of gym for when you get done with class.\" We thought it was another friend pranking us, laughed, and moved on. After class, I had a weird gut feeling and tried to leave through the visitor doors, but the coach told me it wasn't permitted. I walked out, and there he was. He grabbed my throat, jammed his mouth against mine, and told me he was disappointed I wasn\u2019t wearing the jewelry he got me then walked away. I sprinted to my theater teacher, the only teacher I trusted, and cried for the rest of the day until convincing my brother to pick me up.

she didn't use it a lot and was kind enough to let me use it. One late night on a weekend, maybe around 1 am, I was leaving a friend's house, driving, when I noticed a car was following me. I have a feeling they started following me shortly after I left my friend's house but I didn't really notice them till about 10 minutes into my drive. I never got a clear look at the driver as they were remained a shadowy outline, but I will refer to them as \"he\" as that is likely what gender they were. I myself am male and at the time was 16 or 17 years old, but I looked about 14 years old.  \nThe distance between my friend's house and my house was about a 30 minute drive and so it didn't take long to see that \"he\" did not coincidentally have the same route as me.   At one point I even made a wild turn across a grass median and \"he\" followed me. Like a stupid teenager I actually found it sort of exciting so I dragged out my 30 minute drive home into a 60 minute drive home trying to lose him. I was in a jeep that had a top speed of 80 km/hr. that was unlikely to happen.  \nAt one point I had to stop at a red light and he was right behind me. I locked my doors and got ready to run the red light if \"he\" got out of his car. He didn't get out of his car. Even though all I could see was his shadowy outline in my rearview mirror I could feel his eyes eerily locked on me the whole time. I should have been scared but for some reason I felt safe from \"him\" from within my vehicle; as a side note I feel super comfortable in cars, later becoming a stunt driver, so the car tended to lull me into a false sense of security. \nAfter having him follow me for almost an hour I made another unwise teenage decision and lead the creepy person following me right to my home. When I pulled into the driveway of my parent's house I immediately threw the vehicle into park and hopped out of the car. I don't know why but I decided to approach him. Ironically I scared \"him\" and he threw his car in reverse. His tires squealed so I assumed he panicked at my unexpected and bold action. He quickly threw his car back into drive and sped off before I could get a good look at \"him\".  \nSort of ironic that the \"man\" with probably nefarious intentions was scared off by my actions. I should have been scared myself but I was more curious about who he was and what he wanted. Still curious to this day about what he intended, but that said lets not meet again.", "media": null, "score": 35, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comment_count": 9, "over_18": true}, "68": {"id": "1dh8kfk", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ghosts", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "A__I_1", "link_flair_text": "Captured Apparition ", "time": 1719024114.7493217, "created_utc": 1718547504.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/dl37em420y6d1.jpeg", "title": "A mystique being caught in the camera of night watch men.", "permalink": "/r/Ghosts/comments/1dh8kfk/a_mystique_being_caught_in_the_camera_of_night/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 61, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "comment_count": 12, "over_18": false}, "69": {"id": "1dh6l7x", "locked": false, "subreddit": "glitchinthematrix", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Academic-Tension1271", "link_flair_text": "Glitch Vid", "time": 1719024114.9657125, "created_utc": 1718541142.0, "url": "https://youtube.com/shorts/Lqj3T_df7a8?si=919CtxMhy742OszA", "title": "Playground Has Real Life Glitch", "permalink": "/r/GlitchInTheMatrix/comments/1dh6l7x/playground_has_real_life_glitch/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "over_18": false}}}
