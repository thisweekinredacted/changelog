After staying up past my fiance and daughter, sparking a jay, and reading a little more of my book I went into the kitchen for a little munchie snack attack.

I had just come upstairs after a run on our treadmill which we keep on the ground floor where the garage is. I came upstairs and was about to hop in the shower, but on my way up I saw these two plastic skeletons I'd bought for Halloween. The plan was to hang them up on the awning so it looked like they were sitting on our front balcony. It's a bit dirty out there so I decided to put them up before I got in the shower.\nSo I was outside in a sports bra and leggings only. I had to bring a chair from the dining room outside so I could reach the top of the awning. There are hooks for hanging plants up there so I was using said hooks to hang the skeletons. The door to my house was ajar while I was doing this. I was done hanging them and adjusting their poses when a woman came running up the stairs to our front door. \nTo be honest, I was so startled that there was a random woman on my porch that when she said \"I'm dying of thirst. I'm so so thirsty. Can I have some water?\" I just went inside and grabbed a water bottle. We recently had a box of bottled waters delivered so they were jut inside the foyer. \nThis woman followed me inside and I started to panic as I realized I was now inside my house with a strange woman. There is a lot of homeless people and junkies in the neighborhood, but she was well dressed--besides that she was wearing a wool peacoat in 80 degree weather which is odd--and clean. I'm a small person and she was probably a head taller than me and outweighed me by 30+ pounds.\nShe chugged the water bottle and started chatting with me as if we were old friends. She asked how long I'd had the house and where my parents were (I'm over 30 so it was a weird question). I told her my parents had never lived here, and then said \"I have to leave soon so you'd better get going,\" and literally shoved her out the door. \nI texted my husband who is overseas and could see on the ring camera that she left the property. He kept asking why I let her in.  Honestly, I'm not sure why I did but I also really didn't expect her to follow me inside. So, strange woman from the sidewalk who came into my house, let's not meet.

As usual 4 reports from Finland, Denmark Sweden and Norway. Well, almost 4.5 cases this time, since we have an anectdotal story to one of the cases. Enjoy!\nStrange robots in the forest.\nNear Saarij\u00e4rvi, middle of Finland, November 29 1939.\nIt is around 5 pm and 14-year old Arvo is out in the forest collecting firewood together with his father. It is getting dark soon and they decide to go home. They have only been walking for a few minutes when they spot something on the right side of the path. On a small rocky hill about 70 meters (75 yards) away, they discover a strange metallic object. They think it might be a moonshining device. Arvo, who has never seen one wants to go and have a look, but his father says no. It can be dangerous. So they observe the object from a distance instead.\nThe object is partially covered by small trees, but they estimate it to be 4 meters (12 feet) in diameter. It has a conical shape and is wide at the bottom and tapering at the top. The height can probably be about 2.5 meters (7.5 feet). It stands on three long landing legs (each leg consists of 2-3 rods). They now think the object looks more like a craft of some kind. And below, they see an almost 1.5 meter (4.5 feet) long flame shoot out from the bottom. It almost resembles a welding flame. From the lower part there are also 5 \u2013 6 smaller, different colored flames coming out 45 degrees from the hull. They are 0.5 \u2013 1 meter (1.5 \u2013 3 feet) long. The sound coming from these flames is similar to the sound of gas seeping out. Both father and son are now very curious and walk a little further towards the object.\nWhat they thought was a moonshining device hidden in the forest, turned out to be a strange craft. (artistic impression)\nWhen they got a little closer, they hear strange noises from something moving and they get a little worried. They now see that they are not alone. In front of the craft stands a human or humanoid. He is about the height of a grown man. Or maybe a little shorter. He is dressed in a light gray jumpsuit, almost like one worn by astronauts. On his head he has a full-face helmet with a black oval visor. The humanoid also carries a box with flashing lights. Next to him, Arvo and his father see something they only thought existed in books, 2-3 robot-like creatures. When they walk, they lift their legs high and Arvo can see that their legs are thin rods ending in a plate that appears to be their feet. It looks like the humanoid is controlling the robots from his box. The father and Arvo have a hard time seeing what they doing, since it is dusk and there are a lot of trees in the way. It doesn't seem like the strange visitors have seen them and Arvo and his father are starting to get a little scared now and carefully sneak away and then quickly head home.\nArvo and his father only thought robots existed in books and movies, but here they were in front of them. (artistic impression)\nThe next day the Red Army crosses the Finnish border and the country is at war with the Soviet Union. The Winter War has begun. But despite this, Arvo still wants to go back to the place where they saw the craft and the strange creatures. His father protests and forbids it, but Arvo goes there anyway. At the landing site, he discovers triangular marks from the craft's legs and a disgusting, unpleasant smell lingers in the area.\nThis strange story was reported to Finnish UFO investigators many years later, which you notice when they are talking about Astronaut suits, which didn\u2019t exits 1939.\nSource: Mervi Virtanen & URECAT\nThe waving humanoids in the spaceship.\nCape Zealand, Denmark, January 18 1967.\nThis detailed observation was made by children, two boys, Tage 9 years old and Jesper 7 years. But mostly it was Jesper who saw the whole course of events. It was a winter day in January in the afternoon at 4.40 pm and Jesper was outside playing, together with his little sister aged 4 and the neighbor's boy Tage. Jesper looked after his sister when the parents were not at home. The family lived on a farm at the tip of Cape Zealand and next to a minor road that was never very busy. The children were playing on a pile of hay that was next to the road. From the mound they had a good view over the road and down towards the sea that lay between Denmark and Sweden (Kattegatt). This day it was chilly and with a light wind from the west. The clouds were at about 275-300 m (900 feet). Visibility was relatively good and the temperature about 1 \u00b0C (33.8 F). There was also no snow on the ground despite the time of year, as it was near the sea.\nWhen it began to get dark, Tage wanted go home. But just about then he looked up into the sky out at the sea and caught sight of a dark-grey object. It had irregular contours and a downward-curving \"tail\" (A). Tage was frightened by what he saw and shouted to the other children: \"Watch out, there's a tornado coming! It is dangerous!\u201d and then he ran home. The little sister was also frightened and ran inside. Jesper, on the other hand, was not afraid, but he hid in a ditch next to the road just to be safe. From there he had good visibility. He now followed the object and it traveled in the same direction east to west out over Kattegat. The object had now come closer and taken a different shape. It now looked more like a dark sphere with a luminous corona around it. Jesper could also see two yellow beams of light coming from the underside and which were angled outwards. The light beams were also abruptly interrupted in a strange way, and not like a normal light that fades out. (B)\nAt first the object looked like a dark ball with a tail. (source: UFO-Nyt)\nThe object had now also come down at a lower altitude. Suddenly it turned almost 90 degrees towards Jesper and came in from the sea and headed for a small hill which is behind Tages parents house. Now Jesper could make out more of the object and began to see that it resembled a strange craft. It had an orange, faint glow around it and in the middle it had a kind of long oblong window and the strange beams of light came from each side of it. The light rays had now taken on a more blue-green color. The window looked like it was made of glass and there was a blue light coming from it, but it was impossible to see through. On both sides the craft had a lot of strange antennae of different shapes. On one side the antennae protruded further than on the other side and had a yellow ball. The boy thought they looked similar to TV antennas that you have on top of houses. (C)\nWhen it got a little closer the object changed shape. (source: UFO-Nyt)\nAs the craft got closer, three legs were lowered from its underside and it almost looked like it was going to land, but when it was a meter above the ground, the legs went in and the craft continued upwards a little. It now also swung and steered out to sea again at a low altitude. All the while the craft wobbled a little in a strange way. But when it came across the beach, something strange happened. A black substance came out from the underside of the craft down over the beach.\nClose up the boy could now see that it looked like a craft. (Source: UFO-Nyt)\nOver the beach or if it was a short distance out over the water, the craft now made a sharp turn. At the same time, a kind of square metal basket was lowered from the underside. It appeared to be suspended by a thick, heavy-duty cable or metal stay, and the basket did not sway during the maneuvers of the craft. When the basket was down, a hatch was opened at the bottom of the craft and eight \"people\" climbed down from the cable/stay. First came one, then came the rest, and they quickly climbed down into the basket, two by two. The object had now completed its 180 degree turn and was heading straight for the ditch where Jesper was. Some of the \"people\" bent down and picked up something from the bottom of the basket. When they got up again, they had something like binoculars or cameras in their hands, and when they got closer to where Jesper was hiding, the \"people\" looked at him with these devices. When they were almost at the yard where Jesper lived, he could see them clearly and he saw that they were smiling and that they were making a sideways motion with their hand back and forth that looked like a wave to him. Jesper didn't wave back, but just nodded to them. The boy was not afraid during the incident \"because they looked so kind and friendly\", he later told his mother.\nA steel basket was lowered and \\\"people\\\" climed down from the craft. (Source: Hiddenmark)\nWhen the craft passed with the basket about 1 meter (3 feet) above the ground, hardly any sound was heard. Just a slight electrical buzz, kind of like a tape player running with a blank tape. When it was close, Jesper could also make out that there were some signs on the hull under the window. The first was similar to a combined B and H. He couldn't quite remember the other characters, so he mostly guessed. After the craft passed by, 7 of the 8 \"people climbed up through the bottom hatch and disappeared. The last \"person\" remained in the basket when it was hoisted into the craft. It continued at low altitude in the direction of Overby church until it disappeared from view.\nThe \"people\" in the basket, Jesper described as smaller than a grown up human. Rather in height as a child about 120 cm (4 feet). But he did not get the impression that they were children, but that they were adults. All had long faces and long noses. Seven of the \"persons\" were short-cut and had blond hair. The eighth had slightly longer shoulder-length brown hair. Jesper got the impression that this was a woman. The \"people\" also had different clothes. The one who climbed down first (and was also the last one left) had blue clothes. He seemed to be some kind of officer. The others were dressed in a tight-fitting full-length jumpsuit with blue, white and red horizontal stripes. All the \"persons\" were wearing blue caps, similar to old-fashioned ship's caps. Except for the man in blue, everyone carried some kind of container on their back. The containers looked almost a little transparent. From the tubes, a hose went over the shoulders to the mouth. Over the mouth it looked like they had some kind of mouthpiece. When they brought out the devices like the \u201cbinoculars\u201d or \u201ccameras\u201d, they removed the mouthpiece. The man with the blue clothes also had some angular glasses over his eyes. Another strange detail was that everyone had some kind of light attached to each shoulder. It almost looked like a flashlight, although it had light at both ends.\nArtistic impression of the visitors investigating another beach in Denmark, before showing up on the tip of Zealand.\nIt was a very detailed story that the UFO investigators received from Jesper a month after the events. And it matched well with what his mother wrote down the day after the sighting. Unfortunately, no remains of the black slag that the craft dropped on the beach were found. Since no other people saw the incident either, only Jesper's own testimony was available. Of course, no one could guarantee that what the boy told was true or that he was just making it up, but he was very sure on most points and he gave a positive and honest impression, and he himself insisted that he was not lying. Jesper is very careful to point out that there was no helicopter or airplane that he saw. His father was in the local Home Guard Air Force and could attest that the boy had a good knowledge of airplanes. Neither Jesper nor anyone else in the family was very familiar with the UFO phenomenon. So we can only choose to take Jesper at his word or not. It's a fascinating and interesting story nevertheless and it is one of Denmark\u00b4s more famous cases.\nSource: UFO-Nyt, no 2 1967 & https://hiddenmark.dk/ufoer/the-sjaellands-odde-ce3/\nThe mysterious people on the ice.\nLake Pojjujaure, northen Sweden, February 27 1977.\nIt was a fine, clear winter day in February and Sami reindeer owner Nils-Tomas Labba drove his snowmobile along the river Lainio towards Lake Pojjujaure. He was on his way to his reindeer herd, which was somewhere in the area. About 10 o'clock in the morning he arrived at the frozen lake. In the distance he saw some people, who were out walking on the lake, but he couldn't really see how many there were. He thought it was a little strange with people out here, since this was out in the middle of nowhere. Maybe they were fishing on the ice or skiing? He thought no more of it, and continued his journey.\nWhen Nils-Tomas got closer to the shore of the lake, he could still see the people and now count them to four. He saw nothing strange about them, at this distance. He now stopped his snowmobile near the shore and turned off the engine. On the ice a couple of hundred meters (couple of hundred yards) out on the lake, he could see four people walking, who were similarly dressed in brown overalls. Or could they have been military green? (Nils-Tomas could not remember clearly about this). They were too far out to see their faces, but he thought they looked like normal people and thought they might be soldiers on some sort of exercise. He says he was 100% sure he saw the people out there.\nThe reindeer owner Nils-Tomas Labba saw four people on the ice. He thought it was a little strange that they were here so far out in the wilderness. (artistic impression)\nWhen the people out on the ice see Nils-Tomas, they start walking to the left towards the beach further away. They walk parallell to the shore for a short while and then \"Poof\", they suddenly went up in smoke. Nils-Tomas thought they were coming towards him, so he could see who they were, but they just disappeared into thin air. A few seconds later, the air begins to vibrate in a strange way at the place where the people disappeared and then he could see how the pulsating \"air tremble\" rose above the ground and then took off and went up and away to the northeast. It was quite slow for the \"air tremble\" to disappear, approximately at helicopter speed, Nils-Tomas remembers. When it was gone, he remained on his snowmobile with stinging eyes and a surprised expression.\nNils-Tomas imagined that he might have seen something solid inside the \u201cair tremble\u201d, and the object or \"ship\" appeared to be on the border of the material. He thought it seemed round, but it had no sharp edges. He also thinks that it was difficult to determine the dimensions of the \"air tremble\" and estimates that it could be anything between 5 (15) to 20 meters (60 feet) wide. When Nils-Tomas returned to the place, after visiting his reindeer herd, he found no traces of what had happened.\nNils-Tomas Labba passed away in 2011, but his son Lars-Thomas remembers this day clearly. He tells that he was 18 years old and his father came home very upset and shaken on the evening, almost on the verge of being scared. He had never seen him like this before. His father was not the kind of person who got excited and nervous easily. When Nils-Tomas later told others in the village about what he had experienced, no one laughed at him. They did not believe that he was lying when he said that he had seen aliens, but they believed instead that what he saw was actually some kind of phantoms or doppelgangers, supernatural creatures that in Sami traditional tales are called \"Haldi\".\nSource: UFO-Sverige & UFO-information Newsletter. #6 1977\nThe kids and the small playmates from space.\nH\u00f8nefoss, Southern Norway, October 28 1985.\nThis strange incident was witnessed and retold by about a dozen children between the age of 7 to 12 years old. The kids who were involved were H\u00e5vard (9), Rasmus (10), Rune (8), May (11), Helene (10), Freddy (7), Lars (10), P\u00e5l (9) and others and they were out playing in the neighbourhood were they lived in the Henglse area in the town of H\u00f8nefoss.\nThis Monday night it was supposed to be a lunar eclipse and a lot of kids were out to watch it. The area in which the children played consisted of a small quiet street with scattered residential houses with gardens and surrounding forest areas framed by a hill with trees on the east side. There was also a grass lot next door, which they used to kick soccer on and a small playground next to it. It was about 5.45 pm when they saw an unusual light in the sky. It was approaching rapidly from the northeast. As it got closer to the ground, they saw that it was an object like two plates placed against each other, and it was gray-metallic in color and the size of a house garage. The \"spaceship\" as the children called it, had a large, bright light on the bottom and several smaller, dimmer ones on the side. One of the kids (H\u00e5vard) who was on the grass lot, had a flashlight with him which he picked up and shone on the hovering, silent craft. The distance to the object was about 200 meters (220 yards) and at about a 45 degree angle up from the ground. As an answer, a very strong beam of light suddenly came down from the craft towards the children. As it was much stronger than a car's headlights, the children were dazzled. The light only came on for a second or so, then it went out and the craft then began to rise silently upwards, slowly at first and then faster and faster until it disappeared.\nOne of the boys were shining with a flashlight towards the craft. A beam then came back towards the kids. (artistic impression)\nAlmost at the same moment that the craft disappeared, a lot of small 50 cm (1.7 feet) tall creatures appeared around the grass lot and at the edges of the forest. There were very many of them, perhaps upwards of a hundred. They tried to run away from the kids and were very fast. The creatures had different colors of clothing, some were brown, others were black, some were maybe even white. It also looked like they had square helmets on their heads. In the middle of the helmets, two white-yellow eyes shone, something that frightened the children. Their hands had fingers like us humans. How many fingers they had could not be perceived. When the creatures walked or ran, they moved stiffly and in a slightly crouched position. The mysterious creatures were observed until about 9 pm. The children and the creatures spied on each other in a fairly large area around Hengsleveien (Henglse road). In the playground by the grass lot, one of the kids lit a flashlight and shone it at the creatures, but then they got scared and ran into the bushes or the forest and hid. They didn't seem to like bright light. A boy also tried to take pictures of them with a camera, but even then the creatures hid. Now and then the children could hear the creatures mumbling to each other in some incomprehensible language. During the incident, some of the younger children got scared and ran home and told their parents, wanting them to come out to see for themselves. But the parents just thought the kids were making it up and unfortunately didn't come out to check. Even a middle-aged man who was out jogging on Hengsleveien at 6 pm saw something mysterious, as some creatures ran across the road in front of him. But the man couldn't quite make out what kind of dark creature it was and therefore thought it was just cats running past.\nSuddenly small creatures with glowing eyes showed up in the bushes near the kids. (artistic impression)\nAfterwards, strange footprints were discovered in the Andersen family's garden on Hengsleveien. The footprints were very small, about 7 - 11 cm (2.75 - 4.3 inches), and had a slightly different shape. Andersen's dog went completely wild when it smelled the tracks, and then ran further into the garden and hid. The dog also destroyed a lot of the tracks as it jumped around, so that the prints could not be registered completely. Unfortunately, no soil samples were taken from the tracks for analysis either.\nThe footprints they found. (source: UFO #1 1986)\nThe \"spaceship\" as the kids called it, was observed two or three more times during the evening. Even these times it came from the northeast. It was visible for no more than half a minute, and then it quickly disappeared into the sky to the southwest. The same behavior every time it was observed. When the UFO investigators asked the children about the altitude of the saucer, they said it varied anywhere from 100-200 m (400-600 feet) to just below the clouds. They were at about 1000 meters (3000 feet) this evening. What was strange was that every time the \"spaceship\" was visible in the sky, the creatures were gone. No landing of the craft was ever observed either. In a larger grass field in another part of the residential area, some days later, some of the boys saw a small circle of 2-3 meters (6-9 feet) of depressed grass, but it was unclear what caused it and if it had anything to do with the incident from the 28th of October. The craft was also observed by the children in the area for a few more evenings to come for more than two weeks. The last time it was seen was the evening of November 14th.\nLater in the evening on October 28, several of the children felt unwell, with dizziness and headaches etc. And the UFO researchers speculated that a possible cause could be the bright light that the children received in the face from the \"spaceship\". The children in the area were very excited and engaged by what happened several days afterwards and made drawings of creatures and \"spaceships\" and discussed it a lot among themselves and with the adults. Some of the kids seemed worried for a long time, while others joked a little about it and some of the biggest boys even thought what had happened was a little cool. However, the parents noticed that something must have happened, because many of the children were not themselves and were in shock, although some tried to keep up appearances by claiming that they were not afraid at all.\nThe children all made similar drawings of the creatures. (source: UFO #1 1986)\nThe report on this strange case is based entirely on the children's own stories, and even if they diverge a little here and there, they are pretty much the same. Even the drawings on the creatures are similar. But you have to consider that the children have had time to discuss the incident with each other in the days before they were interviewed by the UFO investigators. The first thought you have when you hear a fantastic story like this is that it is made up, especially when there are children involved. But should a story like this be dismissed just because it comes from children? No, of course it shouldn't. It is important to hear what children tell too. And it doesn't have to be made up because it comes from children. They can also experience supernatural events. But you still can not get rid of the idea that children's lively imaginations can play tricks on us.\nSource: UFO #1 1986, UFO Temahefte 2 \u2013 Norske N\u00e6rkontakter av 3. grad 1994\nThe case above is not the only close contact around H\u00f8nefoss. A lot has happened here. Another interesting incident occurred a few years earlier. Could it be related?\nIt was Tuesday, October 25, 1977 and it was about 5 pm and it was dusk outside. The 14-year-old boys Johnny Myhr and Frank Sverre Mandt were on their way from school in the community of \u00c5sbygda just outside H\u00f8nefoss, when they saw something strange that they would never forget. Shaken and shocked, they ran back into the school again and told the staff what they had seen.\nJust outside of the school they had seen a flying craft gliding slowly and soundlessly over a nearby field at low altitude. About 100 meters (110 yards) northeast of the school, the craft stopped and descended for landing in the newly plowed field. But after about 10 seconds the craft took off again and headed upwards and quickly disappeared over the ridge. The boys said the object was saucer-shaped and light green. Underneath, three landing legs were deployed. Around the center of the object were lots of lighted windows. In one of these they saw the silhouette of a humanoid moving. They couldn't see what the being looked like, but they had a strong feeling that it was staring right at the boys.\nThe craft the boys saw landing in the field. (illustration: Chris B. Vos)\nThe principal says that he felt that the boys were shaken and scared when they told the story and he is sure that they experienced something that scared them. But what they saw was difficult to say, as he himself was not there*. \"But there were at least three mysterious marks on the field afterwards. And if it was a helicopter that landed and took off so close to the school, we and others who live near the school should have heard it very clearly\",* said the Principal.\nAfter investigating the area and interviewing the 14-year-old boys, the Norwegian UFO Center was able to state that the young people seemed very credible and intelligent. It was clear that they had experienced something and were not making it up. The prints on the field were made by a heavy object and they were in a triangular shape. There was approximately 6.6 meters (20 feet) between the footprints of the landing legs. The tracks left by the \"feet\" were about 36 x 10 cm (14.2 x 3.9 inches) and they were about 10 cm (4 inches) deep.

The conversation got spicy and I gave him my number so we can continue chatting. We texted that night. We never exchanged photos or nudes or anything like that. Never made plans to meet up. The conversation died and I forgot about them. Weeks go by and I deleted the conversation. \nThen late one night I get a lewd photo of a man I don\u2019t recognize. I think of insulting them but decide to just delete it and not respond. A few weeks later I get another one. I have the idea to check my deleted messages to make sure I don\u2019t know them. Sure enough I find out it\u2019s the Tinder guy. It\u2019s really weird of them to text me a month later just lewd images after no contact or anything for over a month. Eww. So I blocked them.\nA couple weeks later I get a lewd video on my apple watch. It\u2019s the same guy. I\u2019m not sure how I got the message on my watch if I already blocked his number. I block him again on my watch. What a weirdo I think. \nA week later I leave my apartment to go on a walk. I see him! He is right there in front of my apartment walking towards me. He has the same outfit as his profile photos and same tattoos and hat so I am certain it is them. I never mentioned where I lived. I\u2019m freaked out. But I\u2019m dressed in baggy clothes and recently changed up my hair color so I keep my head down in hopes he doesn\u2019t recognize me. I walk right past him. I was to scared to look at him to see his reaction if he recognized me. I was too scared to look back in his direction to see where he went so I just kept walking forward.\nI was severely freaked out but nothing else happened after that and I never saw them again. I never mentioned where I lived so my only thought is he must have used my phone number to look me up. It was the least likely person I would have expected. Just some random person I messaged for only one day on Tinder. Even with the lewd content they sent I still just thought they were a regular perv, I never excepted them to somehow show up at my apartment. They didn\u2019t even text a word to me or attempt to meet up they just send lewds over two months and then appeared. It\u2019s just so random and weird.

Winter holidays were a GREAT time because everyone who could left huge tips. It was a pretty good first official job.  \nEventually, some of the snowbirds moved back and became my customers. One couple, Louise and Gerald, will always stick out in my mind. They started off normal, pretty friendly people.

He complimented and said I was dressed cutely. I was confused because\u2026. It was pajamas I just threw on randomly. I was confused by the compliment but I just went on about my day and didn\u2019t think much of it. \nSomething else to note, his wife Louise was ALWAYS smiling.

I was kinda confused as to why they all had the same name, but I figured maybe multiple people had bought them and they wanted to be polite so they put them out anyways.\nOne day, Louise was out and she had a dog with her. She introduced the dog to me, as they had just adopted her. And guess what? They named her FIDO. All of the dogs they had were named Fido. And they were all shelties, just like that one. I thought this was weird and I told my mom about it, and she told me to not be so judgmental, as it was probably one way they dealt with grief.\nHere\u2019s the thing: they kept trying to get me to come inside.

Coffee and donuts is a little more commonplace, but even that isn\u2019t something people do on a regular basis.) or they\u2019d invite me in to talk to them. I\u2019d always decline because I had more papers to deliver and I wanted to go home.\nGerald kept complimenting my \u2018outfits\u2019 even when they were pajamas. One morning, he did this while getting closer to me and eventually touching my shoulder and I eventually was like \u201cUhhhh. I gotta go.\u201d and left. \nI didn\u2019t tell my mom at the time, as our relationship was good at that point and I feared that telling her of any concerns that I had would make her not trust me/make her mad. This was also at the tail-end of my CSA, which she doesn\u2019t know about to this day, I thought maybe I was just paranoid.\nThen, right before I moved and I gave up my paper route, a REALLY bizarre incident happened. It was a Sunday (the last Sunday I had the paper route to be exact.) so I was out early delivering papers, like, it was still kinda dark out. And Gerald was outside. He complimented my outfit again, getting all creepily close. He invited me inside and I said \u201cI really don\u2019t think my mom would appreciate me being gone for longer than she expects me to. She\u2019s strict.\u201d Which wasn\u2019t the whole truth, but you gotta do what you gotta do. He seemed to get kind of annoyed and just asked \u201cWouldn\u2019t your mom just prefer that you respect your elders and not turn down an invitation?\u201d I felt the color drain from my face and I noped out so quick. I muttered something about how I really had to hurry along because my dog was sick. I heard him say some compliments about how my hair looked pretty (I have very wavy/curly hair that gets very puffy and voluminous when I\u2019m in the humidity and he would bring it up a lot, saying that my hair reminded him of the 80s. I booked it as quickly as I could to the next house without running.\nI didn\u2019t see Gerald after that, but I did see Louise. And she never stopped inviting me to come inside and play with Fido or have tea. I always declined. She seems disappointed every time.\nSo that\u2019s my weird paper-route story. Maybe I\u2019m paranoid, but Gerald and Louise had some funky vibes. Gerald and Louise, let\u2019s not meet.

On my 2nd night, I was in the northwoods and it was getting late, so I was on a backroad in heavy heavy forest and decided to find a spot to sleep in my truck. I went down a dirt road, probably 2 miles or so down the dirt road. At this point, it was very dark, roughly 8pm and absolutely no one for miles. I found a trail in the forest and drove about 100ft into the woods and parked, completely concealed from the dirt road I was just on. I got out to assess the area, but could not see anything as it was completely dark. I got back in the truck and setup for the night. About an hour into watching a movie on my phone, I heard a sound that sounded like a woman screaming and my dog heard it too. I grabbed my pistol, turned on all my lights and opened the door to see what it was. Mind you, absolutely no one knew that I was out there and was far far from civilization. I didn't see anyone or hear anyone, so i ducked back into my truck. I was a little freaked, but figured it was wildlife....idk, i rationalized it. About an hour later, I was falling asleep and felt my truck move as if someone pushed on it. Again, my dog woke up too, so i knew that it wasn't my imagination. I did not turn on any lights or make a sound, but my dog seemed uneasy. I told myself that if I heard anything else, I would get outta dodge. Well, I ended up falling asleep and around midnight I woke up to my dog growling and it happened again! I put on my boots and hopped in the drivers seat and got out of there. As I was driving out, I went around a corner on the dirt road and Im not sure if it was my imagination or what, but I swear I saw a tall skinny thing running off the road as I came around the corner. It took about 30mins to get down the road because I continued down the original dirt road and did not go back the way I came. By this point, it was raining pretty hard and I did not feel comfortable being anywhere dark. I drove an hour and finally found a gas station and ended up staying the night there. I have never been so scared in my life and It takes a lot to get me feeling that way. I dont know what it was, but I know it was not human whatever was out there. I know that much.

I wanted to have this just in case we ever find out there is truth to the alien part of the whole conspiracy thing and because it's such an odd story.\nI know it's a questionable gossip rag publication, but no newspaper or magazines even remotely reputable were going to touch this in 1983. We also probably will never get any sort of verification on whether it happened or not now that everyone involved has passed on and I doubt there's any record of the supposed visit official or otherwise. Supposedly Gleason once spoke with a former Sony Pictures executive about it but that's where the story ends.\nAnyway, I just thought it was an important piece of pop culture history to get a hold of. I may take some high resolution photos and frame it because I don't expect to be able to ever find another copy. As far as I know, the National Enquirer archives, myself and possibly the Co-creator of Twin Peaks: Mark Frost have the only existing copies.\nIt's just a fun story and urban legend to speculate about whether it actually happened or not.", "media": null, "score": 190, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comment_count": 31, "over_18": false}, "63": {"id": "1fj7wld", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ufos", "stickied": false, "category": "Aliens", "author": "Omegamilky", "link_flair_text": "Article", "time": 1726887354.4036336, "created_utc": 1726600250.0, "url": "https://latenighter.com/news/jon-stewart-off-the-daily-show-ronny-chieng-hosting/", "title": "Luis \"Lue\" Elizondo will be on The Daily Show tonight.", "permalink": "/r/UFOs/comments/1fj7wld/luis_lue_elizondo_will_be_on_the_daily_show/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 2318, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comment_count": 242, "over_18": false}, "64": {"id": "1fk4xkj", "locked": false, "subreddit": "aliens", "stickied": false, "category": "Aliens", "author": "Sky5759", "link_flair_text": "Evidence :upvote:", "time": 1726887356.1033487, "created_utc": 1726696918.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fk4xkj", "title": "The most comprehensive analysis of an alien implant to date has revealed a ceramic covering over a meteor sourced metal core which contains a further ceramic lattice and carbon nanotubes which are never found in nature.

I was walking to my friend\u2019s house before school. There was this hedge type bush and I saw a face in it. It was really dark outside considering the time, so I shoved my phone flashlight in there. And when I did I saw this thing lunge at me grab me by the shoulders and then disappear into thin air. This thing was about my high (5\u20199\u201d ) crouching in said bush. It was all black with long skinny fingers, bone like almost. And really long skinny/ sharp teeth. When it touched me I felt a chill go down my back almost like when you get cold out of no where and just shake. After it had touched me I felt really tingly and off, almost like I wasn\u2019t really on earth anymore, but still there if that makes any sense. I promise I\u2019m not on any drugs I just want to know if I\u2019m being possessed.

We live downtown in a city that is considered big here, and the country is considered safe. The bar we went to is close to our place, only one block away.\nWe left the bar, and started walking towards home. We saw a man with his hood up and hands in his pockets, walking on the other side of the street, wobbling a bit. Well, it's Friday night afterall. My guard goes up at night though, and now even more since he was the only person (aside from us) on that stretch of the street.\nWe noticed him cursing under his breath, kicking the ground while walking. That was a little strange, but still nothing too disturbing. \nThe anxiety started to arise when he crossed the street to our side. He was at a distance of maybe 10-15 meters behind us, still cursing, but not directly talking to us and seemingly not even about us. Just cursing and muttering.\nAt this point I want to point out that the part of the pedestrian way next to our apt building is wider than in other parts of the street. You pretty much have to intentionally change course a bit in order to get to our door. \nAnyway, we reach our door and my spouse whispered me to open the door quickly. I did, let her in, and closed the door behind me, which is unusual for me since the door closes by itself in a few seconds.\nWe reached our elevator and when looked back, I see the man just outside the door. He was just staring at us through the glass. He looked a little pissed, but not furious or anything. His hands were still in his pockets. Staring at us. He looked at us for one more second, and moved away from the door. The elevator came, and we headed upstairs.\nI don't know if I'm being dramatic, but it genuinely gave me the creeps. The stare of this guy. He looked at us so attentively. What were his intentions and why did he want to get in our building? I don't even want to speculate what would've happened if I didn't close the door behind us.\nOh, and most likely he wasn't a neighbor, I've never seen him before and I did see him moving away from the door. Also, I didn't hear him opening the door later (you can hear the noise it makes even inside the elevator). \nI don't know. Just creepy. I've never experienced any creepily threatening situations before in my life.\nIn any case, hoodie man, I'd prefer to not meet you again.", "media": null, "score": 10, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comment_count": 0, "over_18": true}, "73": {"id": "1fl645g", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ghosts", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Tea-alwaysHELPs", "link_flair_text": "Caught on Camera \ud83c\udfa5 ", "time": 1726887360.7638333, "created_utc": 1726816007.0, "url": "https://v.redd.it/fdt5bzzjywpd1", "title": "100 percent dodgy shelves, another glass smashed !", "permalink": "/r/Ghosts/comments/1fl645g/100_percent_dodgy_shelves_another_glass_smashed/", "selftext": "So another glass smashed and the work group is going mental !
