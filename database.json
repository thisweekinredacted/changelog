But, either because he's too big a person to get into the specifics, felt it wouldn't help his efforts, or perhaps due to NDA over reprisal complaints - he doesn't share too many details about the specific efforts made against him.\nNerd that I am, I happen to know that all wikipedia edits are logged and publicly accessible. If a page is removed, there will be a log of that as well. They struck low. A mobile account was created from a verizon business phone somewhere in the maryland area, according to WHOIS data, to make edits only to the AATIP and Lue Elizondo articles. Removals are highlighted in yellow. Additions are highlighted in blue.\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j72t0se7wvsd1.png?width=1210&format=png&auto=webp&s=b63b01a438ef0d6de6e714b5e692733600836f61\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yef6yq3cwvsd1.png?width=1195&format=png&auto=webp&s=842bd5b4ca720b658891b14bd2e7bdbc005cf23f\nhttps://preview.redd.it/um2523gmwvsd1.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=708c816a7c210c330c3b156dc81e2a33f1914416\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/108.45.88.153\nAnd of course, this particular IP address / mobile identifier has not been used to make any other edits since 2019. There is more there among the contributions for those who are interested.\nEdit: I'll try to address some of the more valid points. Thank you to all who responded, even if it was just to express your disgust with the man or the topic or my methods. You all contributed, whether you realize it or not, and I give you back only love and understanding.\n\nThe WHOIS data (where I got Maryland from). The screenshot and link to the data are below. The site contains resources for those who want to dig further, though I doubt you will get far. The Gaithersburg/Germantown area is considered a large part of the Washington D.C. area, and both NIST and Lockheed Martin have facilities in the area, along with many others. The edits likely were made from a mobile phone issued to a cybersecurity employee, if I had to guess.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aneowgjlp2td1.png?width=1062&format=png&auto=webp&s=699a57109bf14ea27c5a1aedd2b735aef63e57b5\nhttps://whois-referral.toolforge.org/gateway.py?lookup=true&ip=108.45.88.153\n\n\nYes the edits were undone. Though, I feel this misses the point. Someone was engaged in actively slandering someone else, and this likely has had and will continue to have consequences for the victim. Just because the narrative has been corrected, does not mean the crime didn't happen. It is still a big deal to see what types of harassment are being used to keep people in line. \n\n\nI do not know who removed the edits - I have the same amount of available info for that as I do for identifying the one who made them: essentially old IP assignments. I'm also less motivated to investigate who set the record straight than I am to investigate them happening in the first place. For anyone who doesn't know - the wikipedia edit logs are great drama on almost any topic. It can get nasty in there.\n\n\nTo the anonymous other sleuth who tipped me off on who the individual reponsible might be: thank you, I believe you are likely correct. However, I'm not able to independently corroborate enough to satisfy my own standards that the two are for certain the same individual. If I name drop them, I am guilty of the same type of offense I am complaining another has committed, and I could be wrong to boot. If we've learned anything recently, it's what happens when others make baseless claims. \n\n\nThank you all again for the love and support.", "media": null, "score": 531, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "comment_count": 194, "over_18": false}, "5": {"id": "1g0yz1j", "locked": false, "subreddit": "conspiracy", "stickied": false, "category": "Consipiracy", "author": "SamDiep", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1728701894.5499034, "created_utc": 1728611487.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/klfmuv6c91ud1.png", "title": "Why isnt this the biggest story right now?

So I was with my friend this Saturday in my little french hometown casually hanging out at the border of the town for a whole hour. My friend here is a 17 years old girl. We were sitting on big rocks behind the kindergarten school of our town right in front of the beet field around 8 PM, the sky was starting to turn dark. Nothing has ever really happened in our town since we live in it except recently when a dad stabbed his daughter and wife 40 times but it has nothing to do with my story, note that there aren\u2019t many foreigners there since it\u2019s kind of a lost country town close to Paris.\nSo I was sitting with my friend eating stuff like we casually do when we hangout, when suddenly, I spotted a man with a beanie, he had his hands in his sweatshirt and was directly walking towards us,(he was way too close for my friend and me to get up and walk away). He comes right in front of us and starts talking english, my friend doesn\u2019t speak english so she didn\u2019t really know what was happening at this time, so this guy comes right in front of me when he noticed that I was able to speak english and tries to shake my hand which I deny the approach, (note that he didn\u2019t look like he was drunk or under drugs).\nThe weird guy starts talking to me and he points out the field that was behind my back which means that if I wanted to look at it i would\u2019ve needed to turn back to him, and then he says very insistent \u201cis that cabbage\u201d, I responded yes but he wasn\u2019t satisfied by my response since he was trying to get me to look behind me, however there was literally the other part of the field that was in my line of sight at my left. He tried to get me to look again and again which was kind of stressing because this guy was at like less than a meter away from me which means that he could\u2019ve done everything he wants to me, then he told me some incoherent stuff like \u201cmy driver told me there was cabbage\u201d or \u201cI asked people they didn\u2019t understand\u201d.\u00a0\nRight after saying that he pats my shoulder, goes behind me and crouches at the border of the field, he tells me to come to see if it was cabbage when I clearly told him many times that it was cabbage (even tho it was not, I was just trying to get rid of this creep, but it kinda looked like cabbage). Right when I see that I\u2019m out of his range I say to my friend to take her bag and start running. At first she thought I was joking but when she saw me running she changed her mind. We were like 20 meters away from him and he started walking towards us but rapidly disappeared behind the kindergarten school.\nMy friend and I were both really unsettled and quickly wanted to go home, we said goodbye to each other and we splitted in two different directions, I needed to go by the elementary school that was right next to the kindergarten school to get home, suddenly, I see the creep coming from the road that was between the field and the kindergarten school with his phone on and in his hands. I quickly turned around and went at my friend\u2019s house with her, waiting for his father to drive me home, later that night my friend and I were talking and we suggested that it may be some kidnapping or organs trafficking stuff since it was the first time we saw an alone foreigner that didn\u2019t speak a single word in french, the fact that he got up and escaped quickly when we started running hinted me on the fact that it was just some pretext to get me to move away from my friend.\nMaybe he had texted some guy waiting in a car for them to kidnap my friend or me since the creep was clearly trying to make us lose time with his cabbage thing. Later that night I told what happened to a friend that lives in the same town as us, and he told us that this guy was hanging around the town with a weird behavior that day. We were really unsettled and scared after that event but now we\u2019re completely good and I\u2019m wondering if we're doing too much about that guy even though my intuition really told me to get away from him. If anyone has anything to say to help us clear this if it looks like some already known cases that already happened to someone.\nTo this creep that made me feel I was being trapped in a horror movie, let\u2019s not meet AGAIN.\u00a0", "media": null, "score": 70, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "comment_count": 10, "over_18": true}, "13": {"id": "1fz0zh1", "locked": false, "subreddit": "truecreepy", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "sasbergers", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1728701897.1075358, "created_utc": 1728397319.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/gc1088vkjjtd1.jpeg", "title": "Le Loyon - a mysterious figure that stalked the woods in Switzerland wearing a cloak and gas mask for 10 years", "permalink": "/r/truecreepy/comments/1fz0zh1/le_loyon_a_mysterious_figure_that_stalked_the/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 307, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comment_count": 15, "over_18": false}, "14": {"id": "1fx6tit", "locked": false, "subreddit": "threekings", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "superpeanut45", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1728701897.256615, "created_utc": 1728182610.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/threekings/comments/1fx6tit/elevator_game_in_my_own_apartment_complex/", "title": "Elevator game in my own apartment complex?", "permalink": "/r/threekings/comments/1fx6tit/elevator_game_in_my_own_apartment_complex/", "selftext": "My apartment complex has more than 10 stories, would there be any negative consequences playing it in the building where I live?

Oh, boy where do I even start with this one?\nI guess the best thing I should start with is that I brought this whole situation up with my therapist (I ended up with a psychiatrist and later a therapist in August of 2022 and February 2023 for completely unrelated issues). The first thing he asked me was how does it make me feel, I told him that the whole situation made me extremely uncomfortable, and brought back memories from when I was acting all crazy about someone (albeit I never went as far as Jane did). We talked about a lot of parallels between what I've done in the past, and what she's doing to me now, and we realized that Jane and I might be similar, of course, my therapist didn't try to diagnose her or anything, but it's worth mentioning I'm diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder after my parent's sudden divorce when I was 12, and very messed up relationship I was dragged and forced into with my teacher when I was 13 (it has been sorted out, and I'm not trying to bore you with backstory stuff, but I thought it's worth mentioning it, and plus I was told journaling is good, so I guess this is my version of it).\nFor starters (and this isn't even the juicy part of the story), two days ago, after my younger brother (17 M) and I finished our gym session, we went to the pub, as it was still in the middle of the day, and we didn't think anything of it. We ordered our drinks and food and we started talking. At first, it was the basic older/younger brother banter, then we started gossiping about half our families, and finally, our talk went to Jane. My brother revealed to me that she had been sending him follow requests on Instagram for the past week or so, but he had been ignoring her altogether. We continued talking about her until you guessed it, she just appeared at the pub with one of her friends. She sat on a table rather close to ours, so my brother and I decided to switch to our mom's native language, the beautiful and poetic Spanish. He and I continued rambling about her, I didn't even bat an eye on her. But every time I looked to my right, I could see her staring at us through the reflection of the nearby window. At one point, a guy from my class approached me, and we started talking, and my brother excused himself to the bathroom. The bathroom at this pub is one main area with the sinks, and two separate places for men and women to do their business. I didn't notice her, but she followed my brother into the bathroom. He went into the men's washroom, and when he came back, she was just standing near the sink, staring at him with her \"crazy eyes\" as he said. He washed his hands as she tried to make small talk with him. My brother (lord bless his heart) being the literal copy of our mom (a sassy Cuban woman) just eyed Jane head to toe and said to her \"You're not getting that American passport through me, darlin'\" and left her standing there. Although this might be funny, I did scold him not to do that again, but he said he's not listening to me, so here's that.\nNow the juicy part. This noon I got a DM from a girl that I know from the pub, I opened her message and it was her asking me if I'd seen Jane's IG story. I told her that I had no way of doing that, as she was blocked everywhere. To which the girl apologized for being the one to show me this and she sent me a screenshot of Jane's story. At first, I didn't see anything weird in it, it was just a mirror pic of her in her bedroom. So I asked the girl to explain to me what am I looking at, and she just said to me and I quote verbatim \"Look above her bed\" That's when I had a panic attack. I began to shake and hyperventilate, and my stepdad noticed and he helped me calm down with my stepbrother. They kept asking me what was wrong, and I kept repeating \"She's fucking crazy\" over and over again. I remember (through my tunnel vision) my stepbrother picking up my phone and just saying \"What the actual fuck\" Then my dad looked at it. She had painted a huge canvas portrait, of me. And some of you might say that I'm overreacting, that maybe I'm in the wrong, or maybe I'm the crazy one, but I know what I look like, and the guy in the portrait looks just like me. Black curly hair, high cheekbones, sharp jawline, same mustache and goatee combo, and the part that everyone convinced it's me (as if it didn't look like a literal picture of me) the eyes. See guys, I have heterochromia, my grandpa had it, and his grandpa had it, for some reason every two generations in my mom's side of the family, the second born always has heterochromatic eyes. My right eye is blue, and my left eye's green. And as you can make it up by yourself, that's exactly the eye color combo that the guy in the portrait had.\nThis is where I feel the most conflicted, what now, what do I do now, my doubts about her initial story about her abusive ex are very very high. I'm thinking about contacting him, getting his side of the story, I need to know what's going on, because as clear as it seems, this is still so confusing to me, and it still makes me panic every time I think about it.", "media": null, "score": 58, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "comment_count": 9, "over_18": true}, "29": {"id": "1fwp1ri", "locked": false, "subreddit": "truecreepy", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "dangerdangerman", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1728701906.4313552, "created_utc": 1728130555.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/lsvqa54ejxsd1.jpeg", "title": "Ghost ships - ships found abandoned with no sign of the crew, still occur even with modern methods of rescue, safety and communication.

Several times I can recall waking up in the middle of the night, I'd get the feeling we weren't alone and I noticed something darker than the dark move from behind a table to a stack of boxes. When I looked in the direction I saw 2 to 3 shadow kids darting back an forth peeking out from behind whatever objects they were running behind, they never got too close they always kept some distance. The first time I thought is dreamt it until the next night it happened again, this time I knew it was real when I saw the same 3 figures start darting around again, I had no flashlight and cell phones were still years off, so I was stuck there I tried to wake my friend but he was a deep sleeper. The next morning I told him what I'd seen an he already knew he just said to try to ignore them an keep on like you're sleeping. I'd end up seeing the 3 figures a few more times there only in that one room at very late night. \nMy friends property must of had some kinda weird energy or something to it, this wasn't the only weird/scary thing to happen while staying there, we also had a night where something growled and smacked a pop up camper were were staying in.

Pre-internet, I would consume any books I could in the library on the subject. Once I got internet, I would seek out and read any stories I could find. Of course, most stuff on the internet is fake, but the real ones (or at least very well written ones) were chilling. My favorite & first ghost story I remember was reading about the Brown Lady of Raynham Hall and seeing this eerie picture. \nYou see, I\u2019ve never had a substantial ghost encounter. What I mean is, I\u2019ve experienced minor stuff, but it was so unremarkable that my skepticism would easily write it off. I\u2019ve had a light bulb or two flicker. I\u2019ve smelled the strong but fleeting scent of cigarette smoke, despite no one in my house ever being a smoker. Once or twice, I\u2019ve experienced that \u201chair standing on the back of your neck\u201d and \u201cfeeling like I\u2019m being watched\u201d sensation when I\u2019m alone and the house is too still. But that\u2019s it. \nI\u2019ve also been on several ghost hunts, and all were absolutely dull. Nothing happened. I once spent 8hrs overnight at Waverly Hills Sanitarium (8pm-4am) and even explored the famous \u201cdeath chute\u201d and nothing. No voices, EVPs, shadow figures, etc. \nEven family members I asked over the years didn\u2019t have any stories to share with me. I\u2019ve had no luck getting a real, impactful experience that made a deep impression me. I guess some might consider that lucky, but I feel like I\u2019m just boring, ha. \nSo I would love to get my thrills and chills from YOUR stories, if you feel comfortable sharing them.

The video i'm using: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut6GDA0wG3M\n\nThe whoop noise\n\nIn 3:31 in the video linked, there's two quick whoops, one right after another. I have no clue what other animal could've done this, I don't see how a person could've made the noise, and it doesn't sound like it's coming from the tape. Freeman didn't seem to notice the sound, but I don't put that against the credibility of it, I figure he was deep in concentration on the footprints.\n\nScurrying\n\nWhen the Bigfoot is first seen, look closely, he's not walking, he's sneaking. It's as if he was trying to evade detection, but when Freeman said \"Oh there he goes!\", he realized his cover was blown. That's when he decided to walk confidently. He paused a bit behind the tree before that, possibly thinking about what to do, because one of the more well-known aspects of the footage is that the BF goes to a tree stump across the way that has a baby on it (the baby is visible to me when they're picked up, but at most there's just basically a black shape, so there's not much point to focus on it).\n\nGait\n\nThe walk from 4:51-4:54 is interesting. He slowly puts his foot forward, and then a little more than halfway into the arch, he quickly puts his foot down. When he's putting his foot down, he also leans his body into it. I've tried to do this walk myself, it seems practically impossible for it to come across naturally, I'm not able to do it, but he seems to do it effortlessly.\nAdditionally, the strides at 4:50 and 5:02 are very long. The back leg is bent in order to accompany it.\n\nThe suit question\n\nIt doesn't look like it could be a suit. The abdomen and chest are huge, the butt is large, the back is wide, and the face always strikes me as a real face when I look at it, not a mask. Unfortunately the figure is far away so you cannot make out many details, but I think you can decipher enough.\n\nThe second sighting\n\nAt 5:47, Freeman notices an (apparently) different Bigfoot (\"There's two of them I guess!\"). You can only make out an outline, but what he didn't seem to notice is that there seems to be a baby on their back. This video by BigfootTony examines that part of it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmLEBbF3oSE\nSo yes, while the video quality of the FF isn't great, there are things you can spot in it that I feel greatly contributes to its authenticity of showing a real being and not a man in a suit. All of these add up to a whole imo which makes it impossible to debunk everything. This is not even including how Freeman reacts to everything, which I think is for sure genuine. None of it seems acted to me.\nAnd think about it, why would Freeman include all of these details? He struck me as a very straightforward type of guy, I don't think he would either care or want to go to these lengths. Yes it's true he faked prints in a previous time, but he admitted to that. Meanwhile, he always asserted that this footage is real.\nSo, thoughts on all this?

And as usual four cases from Finland, Denmark, Sweden and Norway. Hope you will enjoy these fascinating stories as much as I did!\nA TV-message from space.\nTurku, Finnish west coast, March 1954.\nThis is a quite well known contactee-case in Finland and was told by the Finnish Air Force mechanic Osmo T. Liene in a TV-documentary from 1992. Most of the events took place when he was a kid and lived in the countryside outside of Turku. A few nights in March 1954, some very strange things would happen to him.\nOne evening when Osmo and his brother were out playing in the area where they lived, they saw an aluminum-colored disk coming over the nearby treetops. It stopped and stood and hovered at the field beside them. The brothers managed to estimate the size of the ship to be about 5-7 meters (15-21 feet) in diameter. Suddenly the craft speeds up towards them and they have to throw themselves into a nearby ditch to avoid being hit by the saucer. As the craft passes over the boys, it drops a white sand quartz-like substance over them. Then the saucer quickly disappears beyond the treetops again.\nThe flying saucer sprayed a sand like substance over Osmo and his brother (artistic impression)\nA few nights later, Osmo had fallen asleep in the living room. Everyone else in the family was sleeping too. It was around midnight when he woke up to people walking outside on the porch and he heard voices talking in a foreign language he had never heard before. He carefully opened the front door and outside stood three strange men dressed in brown overalls made of fabric that almost looked like velvet. They were shorter than normal adult men, had a slightly oriental appearance and they were a bit wrinkled (weathered) and bald. Osmo thought they were Russians, who might have gone to the wrong address. Suddenly they push open the door and barge into the house. The men were surprised that Osmo was already awake, but they said it was good, because he was the one they had come to see. They had questions for him. The leader who seemed to be the youngest of the three, wondered if Osmo was the boy who built radios. He answered yes, and then the stranger entered his room and examined Osmo's radios. The family in the rest of the house was still asleep. The young leader now entered his parent\u2019s bedroom and stood at the edge of the bed where the father was sleeping and smiled kindly at him. Then the man left the room again. Why he did that, Osmo didn't understand.\nOsmo thought the three strange men were Russians who had gone to the wrong house. (artistic impression)\nOne of the other strangers, who looked to be 35-40 years old, was carrying some kind of bag. He asked Osmo to sit at the living room table, while he picked up something. It looked like a small, strange flat TV set, with a monitor and a switch on top (today we would have thought it looked like some kind of laptop), and he placed it on the table in front of the Osmo. The third man who looked to be the oldest at about 50 years of age, was now standing by the window. He kept looking out, as if on guard, wanting to make sure no one came. Osmo saw that the man by the window was sweating on his bald head and forehead, as if he were sick, and asked if he wanted water. The man refused and replied that it was the air they were breathing here that was strange and that it would soon pass. Osmo also tried to light a lamp, but the men forbade him. They now asked him to sit down at the table, and the interview began. Osmo noticed that he understood the strangers perfectly when he had his head towards them and looked at them, but if he turned his head to the side, only a murmur could be heard from the men's mouths.\nAfter each question, the 40-year-old man turned the control on the TV and a clip from Osmo's future was shown. He talked and showed videos from Osmo's whole life up until the \"end\", which was not a nice picture, but showed that he would unfortunately die in a tragic accident, when he was middle-aged. At one point, Osmo tried to turn the switch himself, but then he received a harch reprimand. In the TV documentary, Osmo Liene claims that everything the strangers showed him when he was a boy actually happened later in his life, and he seemed worried that the ending might also be true. Then the \"TV show\" ended and instead they put something on his head. They would now carry out an \"experiment\". It felt like he was getting electric shocks and he was now put into a kind of dream-like trance. The men now continued the interview for a long time before finally finishing. But before they left, the strangers told Osmo that they came from a planet far away, which was in a dense distant group of stars at the edge of our galaxy and that Osmo had been chosen to be one of their contacts here on Earth. Then they went out the front door and disappeared into the night.\nThe visitors had a TV-like device from which they could show selected parts from Osmo's future (Source: 1992 documentary)\nAfter this occasion, Osmo was contacted several times. But after a few visits, the strangers discovered several disturbing and dangerous traits in him and they terminated his mission as a contactee. However, Osmo still met the visitors sporadically throughout his life. At one point when he got older and started working as an aircraft mechanic, he was even given a private flight demonstration of the alien\u00b4s saucer craft. The speed Osmo claimed he measured was Mach 35.\nUnfortunately, Osmo T. Liene died a few years after the documentary in 1992. How he passed away is a bit of a mystery. Some say he died in a tragic car accident just like the aliens predicted, others say he just disappeared and was never found and they say he was actually abducted by the strangers to their home planet, and some say he drank himself to death and passed away completely undramatically at home on the sofa. In any case, this is a fascinating story, which we will never know if it is true or if it was just pure fiction. However, another event occurred that may have a connection to Osmo's case and corroborate it.\nA middle aged Osmo T. Liene tells his story in a finnish 1992 documentary (source: 1992 documentary)\nA few days after Osmo's first encounter with the Strangers, a woman in Finland named Hellwig reported that she encountered an aluminum-colored disk that landed on a road. Outside the ship she saw three people. There was a bald man and two women with long black hair. All three were light skinned and looked oriental with slightly slanted eyes. They were all dressed in a brown full coverall that appeared to be made of velvet. They called Hellwig and a conversation began. The creatures used their own language that sounded very musical, as well as telepathy to communicate with the woman. They invited her to look at their craft, which was about 3 meters (9 feet) wide and had a window at the front. In the woman's UFO report, a detailed description of the craft's construction and propulsion was also given. The visitors also told that they came from \"Arion\", a planet that was very far away, and that their world was ruled by a \"Monarch\". When the craft then took off, Hellwig only felt a light gust of wind and no sound was heard. Some time after this meeting, she began to experience strange things mentally and have mental problems. No doctor understood what was causing it and no medicine seemed to help.\nSources: Thinkaboutits, Tapani Koivola, Youtube: UFO contactee Osmo Liene\nBroby Ufonauts.\nThe island of Fyn, Denmark, July 16(?) 1982.\nThis is one of Denmark's more famous humanoid cases and the observation was made early one summer morning by a 15-year-old. The sun was about to come up and it was 4.30 am and the boy was cycling to his summer job at a garden center in Broby. About 15 minutes after he left his home, he came to a bend in the road next to a grass field. As the boy rounded the curve, he caught sight of something shining out in the field about 50 - 60 meters (150 - 180 feet) away from him. He jumped off the bike and walked closer to the object to see what it was. It looked like two white-glowing soup plates stacked on top of each other and was 3 meters (9 feet) in diameter and 2 meters (6 feet) high. Otherwise, the craft was completely smooth and had no other distinguishing features.\nWhen the boy was 10 - 15 meters (30 - 45 feet) from the object, he also saw some small beings. Four of them walked out in the field with dark bags and appeared to be collecting something, either soil or grass. It almost looked like they were walking more above the grass than on the ground. A fifth being stood by the ship in front of an open hatch in the hull, observing the others. It was dark inside, so the boy couldn't see what was inside the hatch. The humanoids were small and short, only 60 cm (2 feet) tall, and had large heads and ears similar to humans, but more pointed. The skin was maybe grey-white or pale yellow, it was hard to see. They had rather broad chests and short legs. They were dressed in gray or silvery jumpsuits with black belts around their waists.\nSketch of the Ufonauts and their craft. (source: UFO-Information)\nSuddenly, the leader standing in front of the craft seemed to have spotted the boy, as he turned and looked right at the 15-year-old. All the little ufonauts then ran into the craft through the hatch, like from an inaudible command and the UFO began to take off with a hissing or whooshing sound, while the brightness of the craft increased so much that the boy had to shield his eyes with his arms. The craft quickly flew away over some power lines and disappeared in a south-east direction towards the city of Odense. After the craft was gone, the boy walked over to the landing site and could see that the grass had been pressed down. He could not see any other traces. The observer then cycled on to his workplace. Arriving at work, he recounted the experience to his boss, who predictably did not believe him, saying that the boy was probably not fully awake yet.\nRendering of what the small aliens might have looked liked based on sketches and description.\nThe incident was thoroughly investigated by four skilled investigators from SUFOI about a year later. They visited the scene of the incident in the spring of 1983, but then could no longer see any traces. In the field there was now newly sown barley, which was beginning to come up. On site, the investigators were also able to determine that the height of the creatures that the boy claimed were as small as 60 cm (2 feet) actually seemed to be correct. The boy couldn't remember the exact date of the sighting at first, but investigators managed to pin it down to around July 16 based on the descriptions of the weather and discussions with the parents. It could also be stated that the boy seemed to have a trusting and honest impression and the answers to the questions came quickly without much thought or contradictions. He also didn't seem like someone looking for attention. According to the parents, the boy was also not a person who fantasized or daydreamed. Something that was strange was that the investigators were not allowed to contact his boss at the summer job, but this can be explained by the fact that the boy might not want to get into trouble or to be considered weird, for the potential of future jobs at the garden center. In conclusion, this fascinating case is still unsolved and many questions were unfortunately never answered.\nSources: UFO-Nyt no 1, 1984, https://hiddenmark.dk/ufos/the-broby-ufonauts-2/\nThe field were the craft allegedly landed that summer morning. (Source: UFO-Information)\nThe flying man.\nN\u00e5s, middle of Sweden, May 3, 1996.\nThis incredible story took place in the Dalarna region in the spring of 1996. In the evening at 7:30 PM, Karin Bengtsson and her adult son Hans were going out for an evening walk with Karin's four Drever hunting dogs. They drove to a forest area nearby. Just as they had gotten out of the car, one of the dogs broke free and ran away and disappeared into the forest. They ran after, but could not find the Drever Betty. They searched in and around the forest in vain for several hours. At midnight, Karin and Hans caught sight of a light about 100 meters (300 feet) away. They thought it was a vehicle of some kind. It stood in an open place in the forest at a rest area next to a small old rest house. A small gravel road led to this place and Karin had been here the night before and turned the car around, when she was out walking the four dogs. The vehicle looked almost like a jeep or something and it had three lights. Two of them were placed normally like on a car, while the third, which was a little bigger, was placed down by the ground. All three lights glowed dimly. Both Karin and Hans thought something was out of place with the vehicle and that it looked strange, but they never went closer to get a better look. Instead, they went back to their own car and drove on to another place to look for the missing dog.\nWhen Karin, her son and the three dogs approached the resting area in the forest, they could see a mysterious light there. (artistic impression)\nIt was now the middle of the night and Hans and Karin had searched for several hours without success and they were worried that a wolf or bear had taken Betty. But when they heard a dog barking far away in the forest, they drove back to the clearing with the resting place to search. It was about 1:30 AM when they got back to the first place. At approximately 75 meters (225 feet) from the rest area, they stopped the car and got out. The \"Jeep\" was still standing in the same place. But as they were about to walk towards it, it flared up with a bright neon-like glow, almost like a silent explosion. Up to this point, Hans and Karin's versions of the story are identical.\nKarin saw that a man sitting on some kind of chair came flying out of the bright light. The entire object hovered at a height of 4 - 5 meters (12 - 15 feet). The man was holding a driving stick in his right hand, or rather a long rod as it was hanging freely, and he was wearing a full body suit and helmet, almost like the kind a racing driver or astronaut wears. Both the chair and the humanoid being glowed, and was illuminating the surroundings slightly. The strange chair-object hovered slowly over the dirt road, approaching in a zig-zag like motion, back and forth across the road. Karin's first thought was \"Oh, such an advanced technology they must have!\" And she thought it might be a Russian Cosmonaut who had landed here to repair a damaged space craft.\nHans did not quite observe the same thing as Karin. He saw no man sitting on a chair, but only a bright light hovering closer. Both Karin and Hans, on the other hand, were very scared and hurried back into the car and quickly backed away from there. The luminous being must then have been only 40 meters (120 feet) away from them. The three dogs showed clear signs that something unusual was happening. They stood with their paws against the windows and the back seat and barked loudly. They drove home at full speed.\nTowards them on the road came a man on a flying chair. He was dressed in what looked like a space suit and he had a staff or control stick in his right hand. (artisitc impression)\nBut curiosity and worry about Betty took over and a little later in the night Karin drove back alone to the rest area. She parked a short distance away and crept closer on foot into the forest. It was now about 3 am and the sky was starting to get a little brighter in the east, sunrise was coming soon. The object they thought was a Jeep was still there and the three lights were on, but no being in a spacesuit was to be seen. Karin sat hidden approximately 50 \u2013 60 meters (150 \u2013 180 feet) from the object, and did not dare to sneak closer. After a short while, she resumed the search for Betty instead. Karin wandered around the forest looking for the dog, and twice more she returned to the resting place and could then see from a distance that the light was still there.\nAt 5:30 AM she heard Betty's barking in the distance. It sounded like it was coming from the rest area. She returned there and drove the car as close as she dared. But when she reached the clearing, the object was gone. Karin drove forward and turned the car in the place where the object had been, and then the car sank into the ground. The wheels were half buried in mud. All around the ground was hard, but right where the object had been standing, the soil and grass was like a sludge. It was as if the ground had been heated in this place only. The car was stuck, so she had to leave it and walk back. On the way home, she ran into a happy Betty.\nThe next day she contacted the local UFO association, who came to the scene and investigated. Gudrun Andersson at V\u00e4sterbergslagen's UFO association, was then able to ascertain that no other vehicles apart from Gudrun's car had been in the area in recent days, as there were no traces of other vehicles in the grass and soil at the rest area.\nA week later, Karin was visited by her grandson Mikael, 12 years old, and he wanted to see the place where Karin and Hans had their encounter with the unknown. So they went there. Arriving at the rest house, Mikael found a beautiful stone. As he picked it up, they both heard a loud bang from the rest house. It sounded like someone had thrown a large rock against the wall. Both got scared and they got into the car and drove away. On the way home, Mikael said: \"Grandma, the stone is trembling!\". Karin picked it up and also felt how the stone vibrated. When they were home, the stone ended up on the steps to the front door. And there it remained for a long time. And the vibrations quickly died out just a few days later.\nThere is no answer to what it was Karin and Hans saw that night and that she and her grandchild experienced a week later. But Karin herself claimed that it was not aliens they saw, but something from a parallel reality or from other energies, and she believed that this phenomenon had to do with electromagnetism. She thought that since she was hypersensitive to electricity, she might therefore see more of the phenomenon than Hans. Maybe one day we will find out if there is anything in Karin's theory? But until then, this is yet another of many unsolved UFO cases in Sweden.\nSource: UFO-Sweden, UFO-Aktuellt no 4 1996, UFO-Nyt no 3 1997\nThe sinister spheres in the forest.\nRis\u00f8r, southern Norway, August 2009.\nIt was the middle of the day sometime in August, and a man was out walking in the woods around Ris\u00f8r. Suddenly he saw two small lights floating around in the air in front of him. He was about three meters (9 feet) away from them, when they began to move and spin faster and faster until something resembling a black hole appeared. Out of the hole came a white-yellow glowing sphere that had four or five legs. The object then began to walk slowly towards the man. He ran further into the forest and tried to hide, but the sphere came after him, walking through the undergrowth and smaller trees like it was nothing. The eyewitness said he was scared for his life, and felt the only way to save himself was to confront the strange walking sphere. The man grabbed one of the legs, but then felt an electric and vibrating shock, and he was thrown away and landed on some grass some distance away. It felt like he was floating through the ground.\nWhen the witness was out hiking in the woods he came across something terrifying. (artistic impression)\nIt was at this moment that he thought he heard a voice speaking what he thought was Arabic or Hebrew. The man screamed for help, and that is when he saw another man standing in the woods nearby. It was an abnormally tall man (250 cm/ 8 feet) with fair skin and blond hair. The prone man panicked as he saw three more walking glowing spheres coming up behind the tall man. Suddenly, he saw three gray creatures step out of each sphere. The man said they look like the Grays he had seen in movies. They glared angrily at him, but the tall man pointed towards the forest and it seemed he meant for them to disappear from there. When the grays were gone, he started talking to the tall man and he stated that he spent almost 8 hours with him. What the two discussed he either did not remember or did not want to elaborate any further in.\nSource:\u00a0MUFON\nIn the woods he met a strange, tall man. Behind him came three more walking and glowing spheres.

Nobody can deny the impact of climate crises, at least nobody intelligent can deny the impact of the climate crisis anymore.\"\u00a0\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abtNkswu6_s\nHe says this in this video at around the 7:00 minute mark.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/shorts/WDr_pwIDS-w\nThis video of Kamala shows the US governments commitment to hurricane victims.\nThere are all kinds of videos going around stating that FEMA is blocking aid, and not allowing volunteers to go and rescue victims of Hurricane Helene. There's one person who stated he would be \"arrested\" for using his helicopter to go save victims of this hurricane.\nI believe that the fires in Mauii were caused by a DEW attack, and the extreme hurricanes we are seeing on the East Coast of USA are caused by cloud seeding and weather manipulation. This is why climate change has been shoved down everyone's throat for so long now, it's preemptive programming so all these extreme weather events seem normal/natural, when in reality they have been artificially generated. what would be the reason for governments to do this? of course you can argue for the lithium, or for the land in Mauii, however, it could also be a new world order strategy for depopulation - create disasters and pretend like it's \"climate change\" Whatever the true reason for it I don't know, but I believe these weather events are artificially created. Films like \"Leave the World behind\" are preemptive programming as well. Obama once said to someone I know who is involved in politics, \"If you want to hide the truth, put it in a film\". Films like \"They Cloned Tyronne\" hide actual government cover-ups and disguise them as \"comedic fiction\". It's honestly a brilliant strategy, hide the truth in plain sight.\nAnd for anyone who wants to tell me \"trust the science\" of climate change, here's what happens to scientists who discover/study/bring light to science they aren't supposed to, such as zero point energy or anti-gravity tech, which already exist. I've seen ORBs defy the laws of physics IRL, the same size as the ORBS from the MH370 plane video. These technologies already exist, but if you prove it to humanity you end up like one of these people on this list.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1fyk7jx/nothing_to_see_here/\nMy point is simply that humanity is being manipulated and deceived about so many things, climate change is just one of many examples of lies which are used to manipulate our species and guide us into a pre-planned future. I say all this as someone who has seen 4 up close UFO's, all which defied the laws of physics, so I know there is technology that exists which humanity is being kept in the dark about. I have also seen 2 shapeshifters, believe it or not, I don't really care, I'm just being honest and transparent. Whatever all this is about (Illuminate, reptiles, greys, etc.) what seems to be extremely apparent is that we as a species are being manipulated by secret societies. We are constantly being guided into pre-determined events, such as COVID, Mauii, The genocide in Gaza, and now Hurricane Helene and Milton. these are not events are not random, they are pre-planned by secret societies. I don't know what the solution is, but I think we as a species should start by being realistic and understand that DEW's, Zero Point Energy, Anti-Gravity Technology - all these concepts are real, you just can't prove it or you will be killed. (cloud seeding is an exception because it is admittedly/proven to be real).", "media": null, "score": 2471, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "comment_count": 886, "over_18": false}, "64": {"id": "1fwl749", "locked": false, "subreddit": "bigfoot", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "Bullet76", "link_flair_text": "audio", "time": 1728701934.5220048, "created_utc": 1728114241.0, "url": "https://v.redd.it/l4km5ngu6wsd1", "title": "Volume up \u2b06\ufe0f ", "permalink": "/r/bigfoot/comments/1fwl749/volume_up/", "selftext": "", "media": {"reddit_video": {"bitrate_kbps": 5000, "fallback_url": "https://v.redd.it/l4km5ngu6wsd1/DASH_1080.mp4?source=fallback", "has_audio": true, "height": 1920, "width": 1080, "scrubber_media_url": "https://v.redd.it/l4km5ngu6wsd1/DASH_96.mp4", "dash_url": "https://v.redd.it/l4km5ngu6wsd1/DASHPlaylist.mpd?a=1731293934%2CMmM4MTcwZDYxOTI3NmQ0ODllMjQ5MTI3YjM0ZGYyYmUwYjAxZTZiZjE4NTI3YTA4YTNjM2NkZGI5OTgwMTQzMg%3D%3D&v=1&f=sd", "duration": 123, "hls_url": "https://v.redd.it/l4km5ngu6wsd1/HLSPlaylist.m3u8?a=1731293934%2CMTZhZGZmM2M2OTQwOTQ5MDVlNmU3YWNkODFiZThmODVlY2Q3OTU1ODQzMjg0N2IzNDk2MzRlNjI1MDBhODE5Zg%3D%3D&v=1&f=sd", "is_gif": false, "transcoding_status": "completed"}}, "score": 134, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "comment_count": 60, "over_18": false}, "65": {"id": "1fz53xu", "locked": false, "subreddit": "cryptozoology", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "velawesomraptor", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1728701935.0945237, "created_utc": 1728407673.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fz53xu", "title": "Tsuchinoko - theory on existence of this cryptid snake", "permalink": "/r/Cryptozoology/comments/1fz53xu/tsuchinoko_theory_on_existence_of_this_cryptid/", "selftext": "A snake-like cryptid originating in the Western mountains of Japan, this creature was said to have been spotted several times, with many reports occuring in a village called Shimokitayama in the 1980s. An expedition was sent out to find it with no success, and there is a park dedicated to the expedition there now.\nFrom the Wikipedia page:\n\"In the late 1980s, a wave of purported sightings of the tsuchinoko was reported across Japan, primarily in the village of Shimokitayama in Nara Prefecture. In 1988, Kazuo Nozaki, a member of Shimokitayama's village council, launched a \"Tsuchinoko Expedition\" to find the creature, which offered 1 million yen ($7,800 at the time) for its live capture and 300,000 yen for a sample of its skin. The expedition was joined by around 200 people from across the country and lasted until the beginning of the Japanese asset price bubble collapse in 1990 without finding evidence of its existence. To commemorate the event, the Shimokitayama Tsuchinoko Park was established in 2023.\"\nIt is my belief that this is actually a sighting of the blue-tongued skink. One of many theories, including a new species of rare snake, or misidentifying known snakes, this appears to be the most reasonable explanation. The blue-tongued skink is not native to Japan, but it is native to Australia and parts of Indonesia, and could have been brought in as part of the exotic pet trade. The skinks were not brought to Japan until the 1970s, right before sightings began to explode. If you see Pictures 2 and 3, that is their natural range. Ancient/older trading ships may have brought them to Japan for high class society before then.\nBlue-tongued skinks are known as being one of the world's most intelligent reptiles, and they could easily escape from inexperienced owners' care. They also have a long lifespan, which would explain the persistence of Tsuchinoko's presence in certain regions, such as the Western mountains or Shimokitayama. Picture 4 shows a blue-tongued skink in the grass, which does not have clearly protruding legs, and looks a lot like the most common depiction of the Tsuchinoko, seen in picture 1.\nLet me know what you think in the comments, if you have ever heard of the Tsuchinoko, and if you have any theories of your own to explain it, especially now that you all have an idea of what it is! \ud83e\uddd0\ud83e\udded", "media": null, "score": 207, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comment_count": 35, "over_18": false}, "66": {"id": "1fzzsiu", "locked": false, "subreddit": "cryptids", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "IvanGrodzenskyUA", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1728701935.778698, "created_utc": 1728501909.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/2i1y60tl7std1.jpeg", "title": "My created and made sculpture of Goatman", "permalink": "/r/cryptids/comments/1fzzsiu/my_created_and_made_sculpture_of_goatman/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 265, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comment_count": 31, "over_18": false}, "67": {"id": "1fzdhaa", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ghosts", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Professional-Leek601", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1728701936.7754488, "created_utc": 1728429295.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/d2fn6qwo7mtd1.png", "title": "Please tell me someone else sees this thing standing in front of me at this church!
