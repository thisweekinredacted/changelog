At the time, I also dressed very goth even going as far as to wear a real corset and trench coat, mostly just enjoying the attention. \nOne particular afternoon my friend/roommate at the time decided to eat at a local japanese restaurant, with both of us all dressed up. Our waiter was a mediocre skinny white guy who clearly was a little alternative but it was gard to tell really with the uniform. We joked about me leaving my phone number on the reciept or something so I hyped myself up and did so. Late that night he had sent me a text.\nWe talked for a few days, never really having a right time to meet up as I worked 40 minutes away from where I lived. He mentioned the boots he wore meant a lot to him and some other odd things that just seemed like edgy jokes. One really late night coming home I was texting and driving, as any 18 y/o does, and we decided to meet up. My stupid self invited him over to my apartment where it was just me and the roommate who had been with me before. Our other 2 roommates were not home. \nAt first it was fine because I was already drunk so I would just let him rant about whatever he wanted. He went on about his life, going to jail, medical bills, his parents etc. Eventually he asked me if I wanted to see his tattoos and I was like okay. He lifted up his shirt and not only could I see the handgun tucked in his waistband but also his multiple badly covered up nazi tattoos. One was even just slightly covered with a banana. I dont know what it was but I simply decided the best way to deal with this situation was to appease him so I went along with it casually. \nI dont remember exactly every detail because it was over 2 years ago and I was drunk, but he ended up pulling his gun out and putting it to my head, asking me if I was scared. I was immensely confused and tried to call his bluff, saying I wasnt which got him to put it away for a while. When we went to hook up and my messy ass room, he pulled it on me again saying he wanted to do it with it out. I got mad and tried to fight him off me and get it away from my head. Of course, I wasnt as strong as him and he hit me in the arm with it. Which, that shit hurt cause it was a nice one. \nWhen I finally got him off me and he realized I was pissed, not scared, he started acting like a crackhead, saying I was crazy for not caring about him pulling a gun on me. He ran off, jumping the fence of the apartment complex and not even taking his car that he had came in. \nIn the morning, his car was gone and I had a large bruise from where he had hit me. While to me it is a funny story, I now realize how bad it couldve ended up. So to the waiter from the japanese restaurant, lets not meet. \nTLDR: Tried to hookup with a waiter from a Japanese restaurant and he ended up being a nazi who pistol whipped me.", "media": null, "score": 593, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "comment_count": 62, "over_18": true}, "13": {"id": "1b9d42z", "locked": false, "subreddit": "truecreepy", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Sprillet", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1710101759.0718758, "created_utc": 1709866330.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1b9d42z", "title": "In the New Mr. Beast video, does anyone else see this seemingly tin-made creature watching them?

Please.", "permalink": "/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1b7tw6t/i_know_excessive_detail_is_against_the_rules_but/", "selftext": "So I would like to start this off by saying two things, one being if you have already started reading this please finish because I want to know if you have had a similar encounter, and two being that I don\u2019t intend to be rude whatsoever, I just don\u2019t care if anyone believes me or not. I know it would likely be hard for anyone to read an encounter story and instantly buy it, but I don\u2019t know how to state that I am not lying or over exaggerating any detail of this, (every moment has been stained in my mind). So, with that being said I\u2019m not going to go off on any tangents abt why you should believe me, so let\u2019s start.\nAbout a two years ago, (I was 13 almost 14 at the time) was still quite immature for my age, and enjoyed roleplaying as mortal kombat characters, \u201cfighting\u201d with my little brother who is now almost 13. \nBy the way I live in whitefish Montana, near a place called Olney, (surrounded by woods pretty much). I Also have horses basically everywhere on our property, (is important info for later.)\nAnyways, me and my little brother decided to go outside to the back of my house where there is a road that is about 400 ft in length leading up to I would say about 8 round haybales, to pretend to fight each other with wooden swords we had custom detailed and made ourselves. \nI was cosplaying as subzero and my brother was just wearing regular clothes, and we started walking away from our house towards the hay bales because we intended to \u201cfight\u201d on them.\nOnce we had gotten abt half way there which took like a minute, we were almost at the end of our horse pen that was fenced in next to our house reaching out halfway to the bales. \nI remember my brother leaning down to tie one of his shoes that had a messed up lace on the right one, and I am gonna get straight to the point as too many details abt anything but what we both saw still makes me very nervous and sweat.\nI looked over at him and immediately heard a loud trampling/sprinting sound coming from the haybale area. I looked up and at them, and I saw what I thought to be something resembling a human but was extremely tall, (the haybales were stacked two up, and I think four across.) it was grayish white and ran behind the bales in what I assume a pretty much straight line, then going past them and disappearing into the woods that went from behind the hay all the way around my house, besides the main gravel road that brings you to the highway of course. \nI immediately freaked the fuck out, and tried to yell to my brother right beside me but only managed to basically talk super fast to him with an \u201cinside voice\u201d. \nHe as well looked up very quickly because he had heard the running too. There was a small pause where my brother sounded confused, and the right as he did it came back running to the hay bales once again, stopping this time behind the third row (of two stacked on one another). It was so fucking tall that we could both see almost the entirety of the \u201cthings\u201d head, and then it ran kinda forward a little bit and then straight back towards the woods, never to be seen again.\nI want whoever that is reading to this point to know that this all happened in the span of about 5-8 seconds, and saying that whatever this was was running is a complete understatement. \nIt had to be running at least 40 miles an hour, or fast enough where we could both barely make out what it looked like in detail, just the overall appearance. It looked to me as kinda like the rake but way taller and more slender looking and gray.\nI remember my brother yelling what the fuck and literally so do I as we full on bolted back to the house in probably 15 seconds. I got there first , yanked my brother in the door and slammed it harder than any other door I\u2019ve slammed in my life, locking it.\nOf course, my parents didn\u2019t believe us at all, even though I was on the verge of either tears or a heart attack from the adrenaline. They said it was probably a FUCKING moose.\nHopefully I will get better answers here than from them but if not then that\u2019s okay I guess, and to be honest, I really Do hope ppl believe me. It feels like a dream thinking back on it, just as it did the day after the incident. It\u2019s weird that I remembered this again suddenly today while watching a military crawler horror story on YouTube, probably because my mind blocks it out as a false memory or dream, even tho I have a second eye witness.\nIf my brother wasnt with me i doubt i would ever believe what i saw.", "media": null, "score": 65, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "comment_count": 43, "over_18": false}, "27": {"id": "1bbfjkf", "locked": false, "subreddit": "letsnotmeet", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "muffinbreath", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1710101770.834447, "created_utc": 1710091108.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1bbfjkf/saved_by_quarantine/", "title": "Saved by Quarantine ", "permalink": "/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1bbfjkf/saved_by_quarantine/", "selftext": "This goes back a few years to when I was living in a somewhat rough city in interior BC. \nIt all started out in the lineup to pay at a value Village, when a man in front of me turned to make a comment about something I was buying. The conversation pretty much immediately flew off the rails from there as he started in on a completely erratic and unrelated wall of sound about a German Shepard he had 16 years ago that knew German blah blah blah. Disjointed speech, weird subject matter. I mean it was pretty clear to me right off the bat that he was missing a few marbles. I thought nothing more of the encounter after we both paid and left. \nFast forward - again value village (I would often go tune out and thrift as my relief from the toll of exams and studying) and I noticed the man again. He walked right up to me and started to engage in conversation, something about some obscure historical event that I didn\u2019t know about. I gave short but polite answers, as I wasn\u2019t really in the mood to chat. I wish I had been more direct in that moment. I went about my time thrifting anyways and occasionally noticed in my peripherals he was observing me from a distance. No biggie. \nA few days later I\u2019m at VV again, starting in my normal spot of the store (women\u2019s shoes), when the man sidles right up out of nowhere. He doesn\u2019t say Hi this time, just kind of blankly stares and we briefly make eye contact. By this point I\u2019m a little weirded out by our encounters, but not necessarily worried. I quickly scuttle away from interacting with him anyways. Later in class I do mention the encounters to a close friend of mine from the same university program - because after all I\u2019m a single female who lives alone and I also listen to true crime. \nWithin our close knit university program there was a running joke that the close friend of mine (we\u2019ll call her Rachel) and I were \u201ctwins\u201d, in that we\u2019re the same height, both have long blonde hair, and glasses. Facially we\u2019re quite different, but I always understood the mix-ups. Rachel comes into class one morning and tells me that the night before when she and her bf had gone to the grocery store \u2014 he parked and she ran inside. When she returned to the car her bf told her he had seen an older man notice her in the parking lot and watched from his truck as the man followed her into the store. Something had definitely indicated \u201cfollowing\u201d to him. Rachel agreed it was odd, and mentioned that while inside a man had approached her, but when she turned to address him he said \u201csorry, I thought you were someone else\u201d and left. Rachel instantly thought back to the man I had mentioned and after noting a few distinguishable features we were quickly able to establish that it was indeed the same guy.\nBy this point it had become a bit that I had a \u201cstalker\u201d, but I honestly wasn\u2019t feeling scared or threatened yet. He was a scruffy looking guy in his mid 50\u2019s, who seemed kind of lonely and awkward, and I assumed that my initial engagement in conversation those weeks back had given him the impression that we were \u201cfriends\u201d of some sort. Perhaps he was failing to read my cues of disinterest. I also still didn\u2019t know if he was purposely seeking me out or if we happened to go to the same places around the same time as one another. At one point I thought maybe I was being paranoid and he was actually an employee at value village (he wasn\u2019t). \nThis is about the time his behaviour started ramping up. \nAgain at value village (I know I know \u2014 at this point it\u2019s like yelling DON\u2019T GO IN THERE to a girl in a horror movie, but you have to understand this was a small boring ass town and thrifting gave me a shred of joy) \u2014 I was holding up clothing items to myself in a large mirror in the corner of the store to see how they looked. As I\u2019m holding up a dress to my body my eyes focused in the mirror to movement from above my right shoulder. Every hair on my body stood up as I realized it was the man, crouching between racks of baby clothing from about 30ft away, watching me. This time I made no mistake and I was sure he was at the very least seeking me out. Flight kicked in and I quickly left the store - now concerned that he likely knew which car I drove.\nLate in the evening a couple nights later I was picking something up at the grocery store. I was walking along the fronts of the aisles reading the hanging food directory signs above \u2014 when I noticed someone at the opposite end of the aisles was matching my pace and mirroring me from about 60 feet away. Step in step, expressionless and staring, was the man. It was at this point I knew I should at least make mention of his behaviour to the local police. \nThe police unfortunately treated me like I was wasting their time, and provided little comfort or understanding. After all the guy was only ever \u201clooking at me\u201d. I opened a police file and was told I could come back if things got worse. My dad then shipped me a (probably illegal) pocket taser to keep on my person. \nThe last time I ever went to the value village was after I had seen him enter the store, and for once I was the one watching him. I hid behind support poles and racks, ducking out of sight and watched as he made a b-line to my usual starting spot (women\u2019s shoes). He did a quick perimeter lap of the store, scanning as he paced about. I felt my heartbeat thumping in my throat as I watched him repeatedly look down and reach into a side duffel bag he had with him. He left the store after about 2 minutes, and not looking at a single item of clothing. He wasn\u2019t there to shop. He was looking for something he didn\u2019t find, and he was frustrated. \nIt was now mid March of 2020 when I spotted him at my university campus watching my friends and I from a distance as we waited outside of class. We were murmuring about some weird virus on the horizon and how we hoped our exam would be canceled. He quickly ducked out of view as I pointed him out, but not before Rachel had seen, and confirmed this was indeed the man she had mentioned months prior. This was bolder than he had been previously - and I worried how much of my schedule he actually knew. \nThe same day as I walked the 300 meters to my apartment complex across from the university, I saw him perched outside my building entrance. Hands in his lap, duffle bag at his side. At this point I felt like prey, and in my gut I knew it was only a matter of time before things escalated to truly dangerous. He knew my schedule, where I lived, and that I lived alone. I hustled to the back entrance before he caught sight of me, and cried on the phone to my long-distance boyfriend. I was terrified. \nAfter an uneasy night, I woke to an email from our program director. Our exam had indeed been canceled, along with the rest of in-class school work. Students from out of town were free to return home, as classes moved to an online platform for the foreseeable future. I packed a bag and left the next morning, only to return for my possessions some weeks later with my boyfriend in tow. \nI never saw the man again. It\u2019s only on reflection years later that I\u2019m able to appreciate how fucked up the whole situation was. After initially going to the police I felt like I was being dramatic, but looking back it\u2019s clear to see the level of statistical danger I was in. In my heart of hearts I feel like things weren\u2019t simply going to just \u201cgo away\u201d on their own, and I shudder to think about what he had planned next, or what he had in his bag. In some weird way the pandemic possibly saved my ass. \nSo, to my scruffy mid-50\u2019s stalker \u2014 I\u2019m sure you wonder where I went. I guess I really disappeared on you \u2014 How rude.

As we sat at the table eating I was talking to this other guy that I didnt recognize . He looked very familiar but I couldnt place him . After dinner he proceeded to walk out side and help me unload the furniture . He was very nice and I felt very comfortable with him . Just before I woke up from my dream it hit me . This was my cousin William ! I was very excited and Just as I woke up I said out loud,\" That's my cousin William\" . I talking to my mother a couple hours later and I told her all about my dream . She looked at me with a shocked look on her face and calmly said \" Today is his birthday\" ! I was floored  . I have never had a dream with him in it and I had no idea when his birthday was. I considered it a visit and this isn't even close to the first time this has happened to me but it was visits from other friends and family whom have passed away . It happens pretty often . But this one blew me away . Just thought I'd share and read through the comments to see what everyone had to say !

The guys at the two tables next to me (all men, maybe early 60s at one table and early 40s at the other) were already chatting when I got seated. I didn't get the impression they all knew each other. They were talking about how this one type of truck handles the roads up in the mountains. I tuned out, but they were talking loudly.  After about 20 minutes--they're still talking about trucks and roads--one of the guys in his 60s mentions he saw a Bigfoot as a kid on whatever road they were talking about. Obviously, my ears perk up. He procedes to tell what I thought sounded like a sincere account of seeing a Bigfoot on a Boy Scout outing as a kid. Coulda been bullshitting, obviously, but I genuinely thought he sounded truthful. So, the two guys in their 40s listen to his story. At the end of it, one of them looks straight to the Bigfoot guy and says \"Nah, you didn't see that.\" He then starts telling him  that he didn't see what he thought he saw--he was a kid, so it was a bear, it was his imagination, blah, blah. Like right to his face, 100% discounted his whole story. Even kinda laughing at him. I thought, what a prick. It's one thing to not believe him, but to say to him he's totally wrong about what happened to him 50 years ago (and still mock him) is a total dick move. His buddy seemed nicer about it, but didn't say much. Anyway, this is all to say that you really learn a lot about people's character when you reveal something like that--Bigfoot, paranormal experinces... After that, that one guy just seemed like an asshole. I can't imagine mocking someone who tells me they've had any kind of experience like that. I guess the topic of Bigfoot just brings the a-hole out in people.

I loved my imaginary friends and to this day can easily describe and name all of them from when I was 5 to when I turned 9 (I know me being 9 is apparently too old for imaginary friends but that's just what happened), some disappeared as I aged but one in particular remained by me for all my years.\nI remember I named them Bambi since this specific friend looked far different than the rest, most of my imaginary friends looked like normal kids with a few being strange creatures or human looking people with wings or witch hats that did adventures with me, but Bambi has antlers. A human looking person with fucking antlers.\nNow, I rarely saw Bambi despite they've always been beside me since childhood, whenever I played or talked with Bambi it was sometimes when the sun is setting or when it's really dark and most times we talked via my bedroom window or when we're playing somewhere in the gardens where my bedroom faced growing up. But the few times I have looked and saw Bambi were times when it was a large \"group playdate\" or sometimes I see them outside my window when it's dark.\nThe weirdest part is Bambi aged with me. My other imaginary friends were either older than me or weren't shown any form of age but Bambi aged the same time I did. When I was 6, Bambi was 6, when I was 8 so was Bambi, you get the picture.\nBut along side Bambi aging, I recall they never seemed to have a gender. Now I can easily pass this now as an adult in my 20s that maybe this was my brain trying to make sense with some early forms of gender dysphoria that hasn't been discovered yet, but it's still weird think back on it.\nThe first time I \"met\" Bambi was a day I honestly can't recall, my childhood wasn't great so I sadly suffer with some blocked off memories or fuzzy memories that get clearer with how people explain it, but what I do remember is I somehow ended up in my grandparents' backyard playing with the ants pretty far from the house (as if it wasn't obvious I was a pretty weird kid already) when suddenly I looked up and saw them just standing by one of the trees in broad daylight. \nMy grandparents' old house was a very typical suburban house with a backyard pool but also was set up in the part of the backyard I was in with a long dirt hill that went down to the other suburbs that honestly were nicer than I've ever seen and a small forest that didn't hold caves or forest creatures as I liked to think back then but more so led to the fence that blocks you from the highway. So Bambi was standing by the trees of this small forest and was just staring at me.\nI wasn't scared of them, actually it was the opposite since I remember being very excited seeing them. \nNow here's why I kind of want advice of if Bambi was really part of my imagination at the time or if Bambi was somehow something else...\nThere were a few things they said and done that thinking back makes me shiver. \nFor an example: One summer afternoon my mum bought me a bacon sandwich from the local grocery store and I was eating in my garden with Bambi which thinking back it was probably funny for my mum to see me toss half a sandwich to the bushes, when Bambi started saying how good \"real pork\" taste and how I should try their pork one day. \nAnother thing that as a kid I never thought about but now is a little freaked out about was how every once in a while during our late night games or chats Bambi would randomly pester me to sneak out of the fence, sometimes they'd even offer to introduce me to their family, and everytime I would refuse only for it to start again the next time.\nThough I loved and deeply cared for them, I ended up never seeing Bambi again after I turned 10 and we moved to a house to make room for my little sister and just simply grew out of the other imaginary friends and moved on with my life.\nI keep second guessing who or what Bambi was and currently my family and I made plans to look in our attic tomorrow to see if we can find the box of old stuff we had before the move in which I hope I can find some drawings I had of Bambi and hopefully I can share here", "media": null, "score": 60, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "comment_count": 24, "over_18": false}, "41": {"id": "1b7te68", "locked": false, "subreddit": "threekings", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Dan_Theman_003", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1710101783.837465, "created_utc": 1709708412.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/threekings/comments/1b7te68/shiomajiani/", "title": "Shiomajiani", "permalink": "/r/threekings/comments/1b7te68/shiomajiani/", "selftext": "So I tried the salt magic ritual and I don\u2019t know if this is going to work.

I am a very introverted person and have only made a few friends throughout my time in college, about 3 or 4. Also at the time, I had a bit of a fishing phase where I loved fishing. I still do but at the time, I loved to almost everyday. I only really fished the common freshwater fish; bass, sunnies, a few catfish, etc., I was looking to go for something bigger. I was looking to catch carp. My college campus does have a lake and does stock it for students to fish from. My school isn't near a gas station, shopping center, or anything of the sort so I couldn't just go walk to get fishing supplies and I didn't have a car either so I was really only dependent on what I brough from home. Carp are also very sloppy fish so they will eat just straight up food, anything that can produce a pungent odre so I would just get some food from the dining hall and whatever I didn't finish, I would fish with. Carp also prefer wet, sticky, rainy or overcast weather and are more active during the darker parts of the day. I sat in my room boreda around 6:30-7ish when I started hearing rain drops on the window. I didn't immidietly go straight to fishing, rather I just went to the dining hall at dinner, and came back with leftovers to retreive my rain jacket, boots, and fishing gear. I was taking my time so by the time I arrived at the lake it was about 8. Now this lake is a pretty modest size, you could see probably 90% of it regardless of where you stand. 3/4 of it is bare grass where a walking bath walks by while the remaining bit is trees and other brush. I stood on a bank and threw my line in the water. Leaning against a tree, I couldnt go on my phone because of the rain, so my line was focused on my line until something caught my attention. I spotted a person, or at least what I assume to be a person, right on the outer edge of where the trees and brush begin. Now it was a rainy night and street lamps dont stretch to where they where standing so take what i say with a grain of salt but they where wearing light white colored pants, big black sweatshirt, and no shoes, just what appeared to be socks. They where standing in a very marshy swampy area as well I should mention. If they wheren't getting completely soaked from the head down with rain, well they where getting soaked from the feet up with mud. There was also some black box with a small white light coming out of it which peirced through the night insanely bright, though it was a very small light, I'd assume a quarter inch big from where I was standing but the amount of power it had was incredible. They would walk back and fourth from the edge of the lake, look at the lake, and skip or dance back behind a tree multiple times, all the while picking up this small cube and pointing the light in the direction of different areas, going back behind the tree, revealing at the lakes edge, skip back behind, reveal themselves to move the box, go back behind the tree, and do this all over again. I watched them do this multiple times, making my prencense known by making noise and such, but at this point I was more entranched by them rather than my fishing. It wasn't until they went back behind the tree, this time walking normally, stayed behind it for an uncomfortable amount of time, before walking slowly to the lakes edge and like they had a sixth sense, looked directly at me. However from the only light emitting on them, I could only see a metalic shiny silvery sheeth covering their entire face. No holes cut out for eyes or mouth. You may think it could be a clear face pretector but I saw what I saw. They stood there, almost starring into my soul for about 30 seconds, not once did I look away, I dont even think i blinked. But they turned, and I saw they walk into the brush, leaving that small cube on the ground, and they walked down to, what I assume the walking path, which would have lead down to the trail I was standing on. I went to my tackle box and grabbed my pocket knife from my pocket hoping I wouldn't have to use it, though I didn't know I wouldn't have to, as I felt that light shine on my face from the cube, I immediatly looked up and it was facing me. I had had enough. I packed up everything quickly, and as I was walking back towards my dorm, i heard manick footsteps, very much barefoot steps, I ran back the staircase leading back to the main campus but not without looking down the foot trail. I saw what was my final look at that figure, they where sprinting in the opposite direction of my with their arms up in the arm, not screaming or anything. I got back to my dorm safe and sound. Nothing happened the rest of the night but I returned to the lake early the next morning before my classes and I found what appeared to be horse hoof footprints, though very exagerated points on the top, in the shape of a bloated V. I saw the wear in the grass the thing left going back and fourth behind the tree. I didnt find that black box either. Normally I would say that this may be some drunk or high student, but that doesnt explain their extremely weird behavior, those weird footprints in the drying mud, or that shiny face that peirced my soul.

We immediately looked behind us and up. I saw something I have never seen before or have since, it looked like something out of Science Fiction movie/novel. A gaseous purple orb fluctuating in the sky. It resembled a mushroom cloud but mirrored on both ends so they looked the same. It was pulsating a Purple and Pink light everywhere. It had these rings and they were moving all throughout and around the orb. Then it disintegrated into nothing. The whole incident was about 10 seconds in total.
