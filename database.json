Jim & Coral Lorenzen's book \"UFO'S OVER THE AMERICAS\" chapter \"the flesh crawlers\" goes on to describe the event as relayed by investigator Richard Greenwell to the APRO (now defunct), and was put into contact with the abductee via a Peruvian group going by \"Institute Peruano de Relaciones Interplanetarias\". \nIn this encounter the abductee is referred to as C.A.V, an acronym to protect their identify as Mr. C.A.V or \"v\" as described in the report via the recorded tapes of this interaction between Mr. Greenwell and V. The following will be a summation of these events in best order I could manage as C.A.V during this interaction with Mr. Greenwell has himself a difficult time recalling which events happened in which order. \nIn 1949 V/C.A.V was driving on the Pan American Highway to a location called Lomo de Ballena en route from Pucusana to Lima. C.A.V spotted a shining metallic Disc hovering off to the side of the highway and was approx. 500 meters from where C.A.V had parked. He made his way over to the disc which appeared to be hovering six feet off of the ground taking around ten minutes to arrive. \nC.A.V was twenty meters away from the object when three entities exited the craft, the beings did not appear as far as C.A.V could recall, to exit from a visible door but simply arrived in front of him. Quoting C.A.V directly he described the entities as \"-they didn't have a defined form. They looked like three mummies. They had the profile of human beings but their legs were joined. They did not have two legs but one \"double\" one--like twins.\"\nAgain he reiterated \"-they had the form of, well, the description was as if they were sort of mummies. They had no exterior sign of sex, ears, or eyes. A body, a head, and legs joined together.\"\nHe would then go on to state to Mr.Greenwell that these entities has \"one large foot\", and they moved as such \"Yes, yes. They went along the ground but they moved, they sort of slid along the ground.\" Going on to state they moved \"normally\" and made no sound when doing so. \nWhen describing the hands and arms he would go on to say \"Yes, they had arms but their hands consisted of a group of four fingers stuck together and a separate thumb.\"\nThe question of their overall appearance was as such \"No. They had a sort of strange skin, a sort of towely, sandy-colored skin.\"\nWhen asked by Mr.Greenwell if C.A.V meant \"clothing\" or a suit of some sort C.A.V replied \"No, no! They didn't have any clothing. Their only covering was a strange towely skin.\" As well as adding to their facial features or lack-there of\n\"The head had no features at all, except at about the height of the eyes there was an oblong substance like jelly with a sort of bubble in the center. It was the only exterior feature. No ears, no mouth, no nose, nothing. The nose, or where it should be, had a form of a nose, sort of like when you pass a tight stocking over your face. No Nostrils.\"\nIt was at this point these entities began to speak (In the interview C.A.V could not determine which entities were speaking, and whether or not this conversation was occurring via normal speech or via some sort of telepathy) \nAdding to this already strange encounter, the entities did not speak to him in Spanish but in an English accent he described as \"someone who learned the language without adopting an accent.\" The entities would then ask C.A.V where they were located, and if they were located in north america, to which C.A.V informed them that it was in fact south america. At this point the entities swapped from using english into Spanish. Again C.A.V would refer to this spanish as \"learned spanish\" without a specific accent. \nWhen asked if these entities were surprised to find themselves in the wrong continent C.A.V stated they did not, and to speak with the \"chief\" of the land which C.A.V would state there were many \"chiefs\", he attempted to correct the entities asking if they meant \"president\" however according to him they were adamant in using the term \"chief\" specifically. \nIn C.A.V's words he would then say, \"Well, I said I could arrange maybe for someone to come and speak to them. I said I was frightened that they would do us harm, but they answered that they wanted to do no harm and just wanted to speak to my chief, as they had very important things to tell him. then came a series of questions and answers on both sides-\"\nEmphasizing he could not recall which order these questions were answered C.A.V would state the following questions and responses between him and these entities. \n\"One of the things they told me is that we were playing around with a new substance that could endanger the peace of the world--of the universe\"\n\"I asked them where they came from, and they said a strange name. We would call it a star they said, but they came from a place with a strange name I could not understand; probably their planet somewhere.\"\n\"From the conversation we had, I was able to deduce that they were frightened that, by playing around with atomic explosions, we would create some sort of chain reaction which would not only destroy the world but endanger the universe\"\n\"In another question, I [C.A.V] asked them who their God was and I noticed a sort of mockery. \"God?.\" they said. \"What God?\" \"Well, the Supreme Creator,\" I said, \"who made the universe.\" \"Well, we are like gods,\" they said. \"How can you be gods?\" I asked. And they said that we were very backward. They said that we fought over a flag, over a frontier, that we had wars of trifling matters, like children. We were like children literally still in our diapers. We fought over food, we fought over sea. I then asked them if they did not have those same defects. but they said that they had overcome those years, centuries ago.\"\nMr Greenwell would ask for clarification of years or centuries which C.A.V would reply with \"Well, I couldn't say. They said a long time, a long time ago they had overcome the defects of our planet. They told me that they extracted from the sun...I learned later that this is called photosynthesis--which I did not know. the sun, which is the chief source of all energy, provided them with all their necessary energy. They obtained humidity from the atmosphere.\"\nAgain during this conversation as C.A.V asked the entities how they traveled across space \"\nV: No. The name they gave me was strange and unknown to me...I asked them what propulsion method they employed to cross space. They said that, at will, they could add or subtract weight from their vehicle. They accumulated energy through a heat system. Well, I don't understand it at all, but they said it was a method of changes in temperature which created some sort of energy. They said that we had to swallow, digest, and convert our food into energy, whilst they received their energy directly from the sun. They also said they did not practice sex. they said they had no sexes any more or sexual desires, and had no sex problems like us humans. They never felt hunger, which did not make them envious of their brothers. Everything belonged to everyone, while the humans on earth fought over silly things like flags and lands. I then asked them if they had no sex, how did they reproduce? They said that they had the ability to divide themselves down the middle and split themselves into two creatures.\"\nC.A.V would then ask how they could survive traveling at high speeds without their bodies being harmed and one instructed C.A.V to touch him. From C.A.V \"I sort of put my arm around one and pressed his body and had the idea that, if I could make him stay, this would be my proof. You see, I was under a state of shock and was not thinking too clearly. I felt something sort of \"biscuity\"--they had hard bodies. They had no bones, apparently, but cartilages--this permitted them to receive all sorts of blows without damage. I asked them if they had hostile intentions toward us, and they said no; all that they wanted is that we stopped playing around with such a dangerous weapon.\"\nAt this point the entities invited C.A.V aboard the object itself, unlike other such UFO encounters, C.A.V had to physically pull himself into the craft as there was no ladder or steps (which was described as semi-circular), nor was he lifted by any sort of anti-graivty system. He would state that the inside of the craft was mostly empty besides a \"ledge\" that circled the whole interior of the craft. \nOnce C.A.V was inside the craft the entities made noises among themselves described as similar to static on a radio. These beings would then show C.A.V how they would share liquids between each other simply by placing their shoulders together. C.A.V was unsure whether or not this was water as we know it or some other type of bodily substance. But he was told that they receive such moisture from the atmosphere via humidity. \nInside the craft itself C.A.V would state this ledge and the encompassing area on the inside of the craft was transparent and curved towards the edges of the inside where the disc would naturally appeared to follow. And when asked by C.A.V the entities stated the \"ledge\" was all that was needed to accumulate  energy and to pilot the craft. \nThe craft then rose up as C.A.V could feel the process as it flew over the coast, stopped  and went back to its original position. C.A.V would remark that this felt \"rather fast\" and the entities stated they could travel and maneuver at higher speeds but C.A.V would be unable to survive it himself. \nAs they returned and \"landed\" back to their original position C.A.V would ask these entities to demonstrate this ability to split and divide to which they complied. One of these entities would lay down on the ground inside the craft and the middle section of the entity would begin to thin in the middle before splitting in half to form another identical being. The entities stated that the newly formed being retained all memories and knowledge of the original entity after splitting apart. C.A.V asked if they got bored of being \"eternal\" and that this process was a kind of catharsis for them. C.A.V would state that one of these entities was smaller in size than the original and remained that way for the remainder of the encounter. \nThen in a next step which might surprise many, C.A.V attempted to actually grab or capture one of these entities (stating that he was under some type of altered thought process, and that normally this would never be something he would consider otherwise). But when embracing the entity it released a type of soapy liquid that let it slip out of his arms. C.A.V stated that he believed if he had proof of this encounter by taking one of them that he could become rich. \nAt some point they agreed to return the following day in the same location with the requested \"chief\", the entities climbed aboard the craft (C.A.V did not recall how the door closed or if it did). C.A.V would remark how it left, stating \"no. It inclined at about thirty degrees, made a semicircle as if it were going toward the hills, turned toward the sea, picked up great speed and disappeared.\"\nThe entire encounter was as far as he could tell, about half an hour. \nC.A.V would later return to that area, however the entities did not return possibly due to the \"chief\" not being in tow with C.A.V but we can only speculate.", "media": null, "score": 156, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comment_count": 11, "over_18": false}, "10": {"id": "182ahwa", "locked": false, "subreddit": "cryptids", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "scottdude8131", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1700883177.6739643, "created_utc": 1700772345.0, "url": "https://v.redd.it/nfzinredt52c1", "title": "I found one", "permalink": "/r/cryptids/comments/182ahwa/i_found_one/", "selftext": "", "media": {"reddit_video": {"bitrate_kbps": 2400, "fallback_url": "https://v.redd.it/nfzinredt52c1/DASH_720.mp4?source=fallback", "has_audio": true, "height": 1280, "width": 720, "scrubber_media_url": "https://v.redd.it/nfzinredt52c1/DASH_96.mp4", "dash_url": "https://v.redd.it/nfzinredt52c1/DASHPlaylist.mpd?a=1703475177%2COTI3OTE0YzE5NWViMTQ4OTY0OGFkOThlNjllZDVkNzZlZTcxOTI3YjU0NjQyZDU1ZmM4MTU2NTY2MjBlNDk3NQ%3D%3D&v=1&f=sd", "duration": 6, "hls_url": "https://v.redd.it/nfzinredt52c1/HLSPlaylist.m3u8?a=1703475177%2CYzBiNTU4Nzc1MjA1NGE3ZmUxYmE1ZDMxYWYxY2I2ZDk3OTZkYWMwN2Q0OGU2NTA5MDNlMWRjNGYwYzkzNGM2MA%3D%3D&v=1&f=sd", "is_gif": false, "transcoding_status": "completed"}}, "score": 825, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comment_count": 82, "over_18": false}, "11": {"id": "182grmo", "locked": false, "subreddit": "thetruthishere", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "acid_brainz", "link_flair_text": "Angels/Demons", "time": 1700883178.0361362, "created_utc": 1700791006.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/182grmo/saw_a_demon_in_my_ex_he_killed_himself_almost_one/", "title": "Saw a demon in my ex- he killed himself almost one year later.", "permalink": "/r/Thetruthishere/comments/182grmo/saw_a_demon_in_my_ex_he_killed_himself_almost_one/", "selftext": "During the lockdown part of Covid I became very close to my friend who lived in another state.

I always had a big crush on him, and he used to hit on me a lot but I was naive and it went over my head. \nDuring lockdown we began to FaceTime a lot, and I fell hard for him. He kept asking me to come visit him in his state, so once things started going back to normal I bought a plane ticket. \nHe was going through a hard time, and I cared about him.

I could kinda see his, but it almost looked like a layer of a demons face was over his. His eyes weren\u2019t his, and they were piercing into me. The smile was devious. The demon looked like an eastern depiction of a entity, rather than a western depiction. \nI was scared shitless, and I closed my eyes. I was in completely submission to him, and I couldn\u2019t stop orgasming.

Come here.\" \nI called the cops by this point because it was just too fucking weird.  \nAs soon as I get off the phone with them,, he comes walking out of the field.  He's an older man wearing a tan trench coat and my coworker and a customer ran back inside because this dude was hauling ass across the parking lot. \nHe started to come towards the door and I called the cops again. My cook cut him off and told him he needed to go, the man was acting irradically, yelling at my cook and said, \"I'll end your life next time I see you, fucker.\" He kept moving his jacket by his waist like he was flashing a weapon but I couldn't see anything from inside.\nCops get him down the road, and an officer came by and basically said the guy is homeless and not mentally stable (no shit.) We told them everything that happened and my cook pressed charges on him.  The officer told us that there wasn't anything they could do and he wouldn't give her his name so they let him go.  Basically ended it with, \"Oh by the way, he's known to carry a knife in his waistband. Call us if you need us, bye!\" \nHe came back, again hauling ass across the neighboring parking lot and back into the field.  We could hear him screaming, yelling, \"Hey come here\" again and again.  \nWe got busy when the bars closed and haven't heard him yelling since, but I know he's still back there because I had caught him sleeping behind the dumpster before.\nMy manager comes in the morning and I'm going to try to get her to let me take a picture of him off the security tapes so I can warn the other third shift workers. \nThe field that he's camping out in also backs up to a middle school but the cops said, again, there was nothing they could do.\nHopefully he moves on and leaves us alone, or the cops can get him on something where no one gets hurt.", "media": null, "score": 148, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comment_count": 35, "over_18": true}, "13": {"id": "17y6ueg", "locked": false, "subreddit": "truecreepy", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "StateSideSpoonZ", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1700883178.5756822, "created_utc": 1700315303.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/hc88uiyc241c1.jpg", "title": "Elsie Mae Roane Disappearance - Virginia's Oldest Cold Case", "permalink": "/r/truecreepy/comments/17y6ueg/elsie_mae_roane_disappearance_virginias_oldest/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 25, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comment_count": 5, "over_18": false}, "14": {"id": "1833flr", "locked": false, "subreddit": "threekings", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "StarlightStars", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1700883178.7769718, "created_utc": 1700863402.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/threekings/comments/1833flr/ritual_from_my_dads_high_school_journal/", "title": "Ritual From My Dad's High School Journal", "permalink": "/r/threekings/comments/1833flr/ritual_from_my_dads_high_school_journal/", "selftext": "So apparently my dad has a history with the occult which got him in a lot of trouble with the church in his teens and early twenties.

Do not read if this could upset you. Marked NSFW for the content warning. \nWell, I've recently found this subreddit and decided I would share a story to you all. This happened back in 2019-2021 and it still sticks with me today. I will be using fake names for myself and the man I'm talking about. Mary for me, and Dennis for him.\nWhen I was 13, I met someone on discord. He was funny, smart, and exactly my type. He was also 16. (I don't know my logic with that being okay at 13, but I was stupid and na\u00efve) And we became close friends. After about 3 months of knowing him, I told him I had feelings for him. We then ended up \"dating\" (we lived across country from eachother and we were basically just friends but whatever.)\nSo, as we are dating, he starts *basically* grooming me. As a kid who was always on the internet and was exposed to KIK also, I was used to this behavior and thought it was fine. He had me send nude photos, gross messages, and pretty much worship him. I wasn't allowed to talk to people on discord without him there, and stuff like that. He told me he would kill himself if I ever left, or how he was always on drugs because he was so sad. He also was INCREDIBLY racist and thought nazi jokes were ok. I'm so mad at myself for not realizing that it wasn't okay back then.\nHe ends up cheating on me with his ex, and tossed me out of the door. Doesn't talk to me anymore, and says we shouldn't talk anymore because we aren't \"together\". Here's where it gets bad. (Note- this happened over 5 years ago and I have a spotty memory of this time)\nNew accounts pop up in the server we met on (it was a server of a mutual friend's) and start saying horrible things about me. \"Mary is a fat whale\" \"Mary is a *n word*\" and more things of the sort. The accounts have names like \"Jerrytoucheskids\" or \"bigfatwhale\" etc. I had gotten in trouble with the server owners because it was \"my fault\" that people were saying these things, like I had told them to spam things about me or something.\nThe accounts also start messaging me to kill myself, die, how I'm a whale, a whore, and more. I ended up blocking every account and move on with my life. Great, it was over with. Or so I thought it was. Fast forward a year to late summer of 2019. Everything starts up again. The messages, him telling people lies and rumors, and direct threats. \nI was sent unsolicited porn, death threats, slurs, and that I should kill myself because no one cares. At that time I had undiagnosed depression and anxiety almost did kill myself. I went to therapy and tried to get over it. in 2020, right when the quarantine happened, I got a boyfriend. I was super happy and came back out of my shell. He and I would play games on discord together, and I joined more servers. Around 2 months later I got another message.\nSomeone had messaged me named Lily, I believe. It was a normal profile, and we were in a server together, so I thought nothing of it. She then had messaged me how I was, and I had never talked to her before so I was confused. She said we had a long conversation about mental health the day before so she wanted to make sure I was alright. I asked who she was and what she was talking about, and she said something like \"Oh, you told me about this. You said you take medicine for schizophrenia and must have missed a dose. Are you off your meds?\" I was extremely confused and scared, because I had never talked to this person, and certainly didn't have schizophrenia. After about 10 minutes of this charade, I realized it was Dennis. I blocked the account and didn't accept new friend requests.\nThe next day, I got hundreds of messages with the same contents I previously mentioned. The threats, porn, etc. I was so terrified, I asked my boyfriend for help. He told me to make a new account and not friend any of the other mutual friends, so he couldn't find me. I did, which cost an affiliated Twitch account that I had spent years building. I changed all my accounts, deleted most, and made new ones.\nThe messages found me again. I have no idea how, these new accounts weren't tied to me. I got fed up and had asked a mutual friend I thought I could trust, some personal information about Dennis to go to the police and get a possible restraining order or something- I didn't totally know how the police handled these issues.\nMonths go by and nothing. Until the fall of 2021, in which Dennis messages me calling me a stupid bitch, and how he will always find me. How I'm so fat and dumb and no one loves me. I isolated myself and deleted more accounts. I never was able to go to the police because I had no information, like his full name or address. \nIt's been two years, and everyday I worry if he lives near me, if he knows where I live, or go to school. I recently found out he had a website, and made youtube videos. He has made youtube videos referencing me (IN 2022) His \"copyright claim\" is something like \"Mary the fat whale inc.\" I can't find it anymore, so I put the closest to what I remembered. It was hell, and I'm still worried every day that he will find me. I believe he has a reddit account and could find this. \nI hope we don't meet again Dennis.

Anyway, every person is dressed that way. Tshirt, leather vest, blue jeans and boots. This house was somewhere around Pensacola, FL, it was deep in the woods around a creek. \nSince we were outside, I asked where the restroom is, the wife of the biker who owns the home tells me and I go alone upstairs where not a soul was. I turn to go into the bathroom and I'll never forget.\nA tall man with black slicked hair, white button up dress shirt, black slacks and dress shoes was leaning over the sink and looking into the mirror. Totally solid, not moving at all and looked like a living human. I thought he was dressed so strange for the party, but I ended up not using the restroom because he was in there.\nI go back to the lady that told me where the restroom is and I said who is the man in the bathroom? I described him and her eyes went huge and she looked spooked.\nShe then told me the principal of a school lived and died in that home, and I described him accurately. She told a lot of people around us, it was so remarkable at the time. I did not go back up stairs alone after that.

I grew up hearing many stories from my parents and family but never actually experienced anything. My family in MX dabbles in spirituality and \u201csanaciones\u201d along with other healing measures that I never really grew up around since I grew up in the states other than a few things my mom did. So a few years ago, I went to visit family in Mexico City. My 2 sisters and my son stayed with my aunt and her husband. My little sister, my son, and I slept in their small bedroom. The whole bed took up the room pretty much there was small walking area on either side of the bed. My aunts husband is really big on curing people and herbs and he even has spiritual guides, etc. I don\u2019t really understand it but he has a mantle with all his stuff in the room next to where we were staying. One night, I woke up in the middle of deep sleep as I felt someone staring at me. It\u2019s a very weird and distinct feeling when a stare wakes you up. I quickly sat up and saw this short old woman. She was light brown skinned and had very very short white Afro with glasses. She had a smile on her face and had a periwinkle colored sweater. She was just looking at me. I asked her \u201chey ,do you need something? \u201c I was disoriented for a second bc I didn\u2019t know what time it was or if she was a guest that came in that night/morning. She didn\u2019t say anything back she just stared and smiled. I assumed she was real but didn\u2019t understand me or hear me. But then I quickly realized that there\u2019s no way she could be standing where she was as the room was very small and our luggage was strewn all over the floor and there was literally no place to walk from the entry door to where she was standing in front of me. As soon as I realized that, she floated towards a Jesus painting that was hanging on the right side of the bed which was on the wall that was separating the room next door. I was left speechless, like nothing came out. I finally tried to wake my sister up but she went under the covers and I ran to the living room and slept there. My uncle thought it may have been one of his spiritual guides. Im not so sure. I didn\u2019t  feel anything evil about her but it was scary nonetheless. My family is very spiritual and they believe in all of that so if I was ever a skeptic before that night really made me believe in the supernatural.", "media": null, "score": 28, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comment_count": 1, "over_18": false}, "56": {"id": "182ylbb", "locked": false, "subreddit": "letsnotmeet", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Beneficial-Fuel-8313", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1700883213.3881357, "created_utc": 1700850545.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/182ylbb/on_a_night_train_in_europe/", "title": "On a night train in Europe", "permalink": "/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/182ylbb/on_a_night_train_in_europe/", "selftext": "This strange experience happened in 2005 when I was backpacking around Europe with my girlfriend at the time. It\u2019s not as scary as others on this sub but it\u2019s stuck in my mind since then, and I still don\u2019t know what to make of it.\nI\u2019m blurry on some of the details these days, but we were in Paris and had decided for some reason to catch an overnight train to Prague. It\u2019s a long trip of maybe 12 hours that takes you through Germany. The train was quite old with those classic-looking seat booths that you see in the movies, with two rows of seats facing each other. Each booth is enclosed with a sliding door. The luggage is stored above each row on racks, which is important to the story.\nWhen we boarded the train in Paris we sat next to each other on one side and the other seats were full by the time the train departed. I think we both slept on and off as the train passed from France into Germany. At the borders the train stopped, lights came on and everyone\u2019s passport was inspected. I\u2019m not sure where we were when strange things started happening, perhaps we had also crossed the Czech border. Everyone else was asleep in the booth but I\u2019m a terrible sleeper and wake at the slightest noise. At some point, the booth door slid open with a bang and a man was standing there. He wasn\u2019t a train conductor, just some guy in a brown coat. I woke up at looked at him, he was looking at each of the sleeping passengers one by one, and then he looked at me for longer than made sense. And then he slammed the door and left. Sometime later, maybe an hour, the same thing happened. The door was slid open quite loudly and a man stood there and looked at everyone in the booth. He saw me watching him and then after a while slid the door shut quite loudly. The same thing kept happening and I remember thinking what the f&*% is up with these guys who keep coming in here. Although it did seem weird I didn\u2019t think much more of it.\nWhen we eventually arrived in Prague in the morning we went to a hostel that we had found in the Lonely Planet guidebook for Prague, and there we met a group of other backpackers waiting in the lobby who had also just arrived on a night train. One of them told us that he kept his passport in a pouch around his neck under his shirt and that in the early hours of the train trip, he woke up to find a man trying to pull it out and unbutton it. He moved or said something and the man had run out of the booth. One of the other backpackers said she had been in a different booth and had woken up to discover someone opening her backpack which was on the floor. They said that when they had arrived in Prague they had checked their luggage and had discovered that things were missing in ways that didn\u2019t seem possible. One guy had bought a Swiss army knife as a present and had kept it in its original box in his backpack. The box was still in his backpack but the knife inside had been carefully removed, leaving the box in the backpack. His backpack had been above his seat. It would have taken someone time to open the backpack, rummage through and find the box, and then close everything back up. I remember another guy said he had some money missing from his pouch that he also kept under his shirt. He couldn't believe someone had managed to get under his shirt without him waking up. Once they had all checked their bags a number of them were missing items. This group was freaked out and had no idea how anyone had been able to rob them without any of them waking up, so they came up with the theory that someone must have released some kind of gas into the booths to put everyone to sleep so that they could go through their stuff uninterrupted. They thought that the train conductors must have been in on it. It made me wonder whether the men who had been opening the doors of our booth were checking if we were conscious. At the time I was wondering why were they so rough with the doors, and why were they studying everyone\u2019s faces like that. Is it even possible to \u2018gas\u2019 a group of people on a train like this? Do I have a natural resistance to sleeping gas?!

This legislation will not only shed light on the nature and origin of these phenomena, but also open the door for scientific inquiry, technological innovation, and cultural transformation. However, this legislation will not pass without the support and pressure from the public, who have the right and the duty to demand transparency and accountability from their government.\n\n\nOne of the most effective ways to help the cause of UAP disclosure is to contact your representatives and urge them to support the amendment and vote for it in Congress. \n\n\nYour representatives are elected to serve your interests and needs, and they need to hear from you about this important issue. You can use the [Congress.gov] website to find your senators and representatives and their contact information. You can call, email, or write to them and express your views and concerns about UAP disclosure. \n\n\nYou can also ask them to co-sponsor the amendment and join the bipartisan coalition led by Senator Schumer. By contacting your representatives, you can make your voice heard and influence their decision-making process.\n\n", "media": null, "score": 253, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comment_count": 25, "over_18": false}, "64": {"id": "181pw0e", "locked": false, "subreddit": "conspiracy", "stickied": false, "category": "Consipiracy", "author": "competitive__racist", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1700883222.0167692, "created_utc": 1700704034.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/adqbbl27602c1.jpeg", "title": "Just in time for election season", "permalink": "/r/conspiracy/comments/181pw0e/just_in_time_for_election_season/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 1347, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "comment_count": 248, "over_18": false}, "65": {"id": "180rbwf", "locked": false, "subreddit": "conspiracyfact", "stickied": false, "category": "Consipiracy", "author": "GypsyRoadHGHWy", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1700883222.4254723, "created_utc": 1700600441.0, "url": "https://youtu.be/5ccZMd5ykeg", "title": "The Westall UFO Incident: Australia's Greatest Mystery", "permalink": "/r/conspiracyfact/comments/180rbwf/the_westall_ufo_incident_australias_greatest/", "selftext": "", "media": {"oembed": {"provider_url": "https://www.youtube.com/", "title": "The Westall UFO Incident: Australia's Greatest Mystery", "html": "<iframe width=\"356\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5ccZMd5ykeg?feature=oembed&enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen title=\"The Westall UFO Incident: Australia&#39;s Greatest Mystery\"></iframe>", "thumbnail_width": 480, "height": 200, "width": 356, "version": "1.0", "author_name": "Paranormal Highway", "provider_name": "YouTube", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5ccZMd5ykeg/hqdefault.jpg", "type": "video", "thumbnail_height": 360, "author_url": "https://www.youtube.com/@ParanormalHighway"}, "type": "youtube.com"}, "score": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comment_count": 1, "over_18": false}, "66": {"id": "180ygl4", "locked": false, "subreddit": "bigfoot", "stickied": true, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "Tenn_Tux", "link_flair_text": "announcement \ud83d\udce3", "time": 1700883223.1655562, "created_utc": 1700619825.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/bigfoot/comments/180ygl4/sonny_vator_videos_will_be_removed_on_sight_until/", "title": "Sonny Vator videos will be removed on sight until further notice.", "permalink": "/r/bigfoot/comments/180ygl4/sonny_vator_videos_will_be_removed_on_sight_until/", "selftext": "The sub has been flooded with repeated posting of the most recent \u201ccrime scene tape\u201d video and has reached the point of  becoming disruptive.", "media": null, "score": 198, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comment_count": 73, "over_18": false}, "67": {"id": "182udq1", "locked": false, "subreddit": "cryptozoology", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "truthisfictionyt", "link_flair_text": "Lore ", "time": 1700883224.3216357, "created_utc": 1700839133.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/ymvvmo1zbb2c1.jpg", "title": "The pliohyrax was a species of giant hyrax that went extinct over two million years ago.

So I am an avid bow hunter and have had a few \u201cweird\u201d experiences in the woods at night. Nothing more than unsettled feelings or a weird noise far off. But I cannot explain what this video is. Okay, context:\nI hunt atop an abandoned coal mine that was in operation from the 1890s through the late 1940s. At different points throughout the mines history, cave ins, explosions, and other unfortunate incidents have killed dozens of men, many of whom still reside in the cave as their bodies were in locations too dangerous for rescue. They simply sealed off those portions of the mine with cement and kept going. \nCriss crossed across this property is old mining roads, one of which can be seen in the video. The figure seems to slow down when crossing the old road and then speed up again afterwards. I don\u2019t believe this is something on the lens as the figure moves behind the trees on the left side of the road and in front of the trees on the right. I also can make out what looks to be legs underneath the figure in certain positions of the video. \nSo the freakiest part is this: Compared to photos and videos of myself and my buddy in similar spots, this figure seems to be about 10 feet tall. \nCan anyone talk me down about this, every alarm in my head is screaming \u201cGHOST\u201d\ud83d\ude02", "media": {"reddit_video": {"bitrate_kbps": 1200, "fallback_url": "https://v.redd.it/1hozttvcb72c1/DASH_480.mp4?source=fallback", "has_audio": true, "height": 480, "width": 854, "scrubber_media_url": "https://v.redd.it/1hozttvcb72c1/DASH_96.mp4", "dash_url": "https://v.redd.it/1hozttvcb72c1/DASHPlaylist.mpd?a=1703475224%2CMjVhMDQ3NDQ3MTVhM2EyYTQ5NTA0NGIyM2IzMzIxYzRiNWM5NzAwMWU4Y2JiZjRlMWYwODZlZmI5MDRjZjE5Ng%3D%3D&v=1&f=sd", "duration": 10, "hls_url": "https://v.redd.it/1hozttvcb72c1/HLSPlaylist.m3u8?a=1703475224%2CZjk1MjFjYmZhMWJmMmJkZTBlNzNkZjliZjNlZjI2ZWQzNmRmZmVkOTZiMDBhZGFmYjJlNmFkYTkyMWE0ZWRjOQ%3D%3D&v=1&f=sd", "is_gif": false, "transcoding_status": "completed"}}, "score": 50, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "comment_count": 19, "over_18": false}, "69": {"id": "180dsh1", "locked": false, "subreddit": "thetruthishere", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "saba_is_my_homegirl", "link_flair_text": "Discussion/Advice", "time": 1700883225.4637175, "created_utc": 1700561670.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/180dsh1/personal_experience_advice_please/", "title": "Personal experience: advice please", "permalink": "/r/Thetruthishere/comments/180dsh1/personal_experience_advice_please/", "selftext": "Hey! \nMoved into my house 2 years ago and have always felt great, positive energy.

This is important because there are only 2 floors and we were at the end of the hallway, so not many guests on our end which was nice because it was quiet.... for the most part. Joey and I were watching TV when we heard what sounded like very heavy footsteps above us. Followed by the sound of a small cast-iron cannon ball being dropped directly above where our heads were. That in itself was terrifying because like seriously wtf. Later on, Joey and I are sitting on the bed, my back facing him, when all the sudden Joey goes, \"Woah! What the fuck?!\" I look up at him and ask what happened and he told me that he had just seen a massive white orb float from the bed to the ceiling right between us. I was like, WHAT?! And then I realized that for the last 15 minutes it had been very cold between us (temperature wise).\nSaturday night, again, Joey and I are sitting on the bed just cuddling and watching TV when out of nowhere I hear a woman's voice in my ear loudly whisper, \"Hey!\"! I jumped and screamed and I asked Joey, \"Did you hear that?!\" And he said he hadn't heard anything. Half hour goes by and all the sudden I feel a very cold hand touch my upper thigh! I screamed louder than I had before and jumped off the bed. Joey was panicking and asking me what happened and I told him that someone just touched me! I was for sure freaked out now. We had to go outside for a full half hour just for me.to calm down.\nWell, we left the motel at 10 in the morning. Ever since Saturday night, I haven't stopped hearing whispering, my name being whispered or hey being whispered in my ear. I'm thoroughly freaked out. I'm in North Carolina if that helps.
