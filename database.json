You basically walk out of the city on a road mostly used by farmers to get to their fields. It was a windy but clear day. \nThe first thing I noticed was that my two dogs (both labs) didn\u2018t want to go on any further. This is highly unusual because they are always to excited to go on a walk and they have never done that before or ever since. The second thing I noticed was this weird sort of low frequence humming which sounded like it came from the sky. It pretty much sounded like a really loud low flying airplane so I scanned the sky but didn\u2018t see anything. \nYes it was weird especially in combination with the behavior of my dogs but I didn\u2018t really give it much thought and tried to get my dogs to keep going, but they persisted and started whining (no idea if that\u2019s the correct word I\u2018m not a native speaker). \nNow I started to worry so I looked around the area to see what could have possibly frightened them so much. \nThat\u2018s when I saw this strange object standing in a field about 15 meters off the side of the road. This field usually has horses in them so it is surrounded by an electric fence. However on this day there were no horses there. This strange feeling of dredd or primal fear filled my body completely when I stared at the object, maybe because it didn\u2018t look like anything I\u2018ve ever seen before. I felt like I was stuck to the road and and couldn\u2018t move. I noticed now that the object, which I firstly believed to be some sort of machine because of its silver or chrome color, had vague human-like feautes. It had four limbs all ending in sharp edges. They had some black material or liquid on them as if it had dipped them in oil. Its head also had clear edges and looked very unorganic, like it was constructed. It looked directly at me and I could see that it was sort of blinking permanently. Its nose and mouth looked more like openings in its head. \nThe longer I looked at it, the more strange things I noticed and the stranger I felt myself, like I was looking at something so foreign to my understanding of the world and life that I was about to fall apart. \nOn the top of its head, it had this cone like structure cut out at the very top where some sort of orb was. It looked like a perfect golden ball and it was reflecting the sunlight. I also began to notice maybe the weirdest feature of this thing which was that it was extremely muscular. Still it looked more like a shell in which muscles were carved than actually organic matter. I also saw what looked like cables on its upper body and arms as well as stripes on its arms and legs. \nAs embarassing as it sounds I felt like I was about to shit myself so I tried with every fibre of my being to turn around and when after about 30 seconds I could move again so I ran away as fast as I could with my dogs back home. I did tell my parents and brother and together we checked the spot but it was gone. To this day I hate myself for leaving my phone at home because even though my parents say they believe me I get this weird feeling that they actually don\u2019t. Luckily I already went to therapy before this encounter because I was really struggling with what I saw. I\u2018ve never had any kind of hallucinations in my life, have never taken any drugs and don\u2018t have any mental illness which could explain what I saw that day. I can not rationalize it and it made my already bad anxiety even worse. It felt like I saw something which I was not meant to, something which my brain can\u2018t process. \nNow 6 years later I\u2018m better but still think about what I saw basically erveryday. I still live here and the spot is about 200 away. Sometimes I go on walks there but always with my brother and everytime I hear an airplane I get really uncomfortable and make sure it really is a plane. I even downloaded the app \u201eflight radar\u201c to make sure there is a plane in the area when I hear one.\nThe reason I\u2018m sharing this now is that I hope to find out I am not the only one who saw something like this. Maybe someone saw something similar and if so, please tell me!", "media": null, "score": 954, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comment_count": 184, "over_18": false}, "10": {"id": "1gmavex", "locked": false, "subreddit": "cryptids", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "UnhappyBerry4940", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1731120984.6383712, "created_utc": 1731041980.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/egtbayvj0mzd1.jpeg", "title": "My friend took this picture in Minnesota near Saint Paul does anyone have any idea what it is?", "permalink": "/r/cryptids/comments/1gmavex/my_friend_took_this_picture_in_minnesota_near/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 868, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "comment_count": 104, "over_18": false}, "11": {"id": "1gjp9cx", "locked": false, "subreddit": "thetruthishere", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Apprehensive-Can-406", "link_flair_text": "Paranormal Investigation", "time": 1731120984.8823965, "created_utc": 1730754350.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1gjp9cx/weird_loud_breathing_noise_whenever_im_alone_at/", "title": "Weird loud breathing noise whenever I\u2019m alone at home.", "permalink": "/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1gjp9cx/weird_loud_breathing_noise_whenever_im_alone_at/", "selftext": "This is a reoccurring issue that\u2019s been reported by multiple members of my family.

I'm a 19-year old freshman at uni who moved from a fairly small town to a big city.\nThere was a guy I talked to over tinder for around two weeks. He was cute and seemed nice, we had a lot in common, he even studied at the same university. He was older though - he already had a degree and was now doing post-grad. The first time we ever met, we went out to grab a coffee on monday, exactly a week ago. I had a great time and when he asked me if I'd like to get drinks (drinking age here is 18) on saturday, I happily said yes.\nWe met up at a local bar and talked without a moment of awkwardness for two hours. We really clicked. I had to go to the bathroom and when I came back, a man was waiting for me outside the toilet. He stopped me and told me the guy sitting at my table put something in my drink and asked if I wanted him to call the police.\nI thanked him, but said no, everything's fine, and went back to my table. I really liked the guy and wanted to believe that the random man was just pranking me. Still I wasn't willing to risk it, so I told him directly what happened - I said \"I'm sorry, this sounds insane, but after I got out the bathroom some random guy told me you put something in my drink\".\nHe laughed and said that's insane, as if we were giggling at the situation together. He wasn't serious about it at all. I apologized and said I don't think he did that, not at all, but I'd be much more at peace if he chugged my drink just so I'd know the random guy was pranking me, because nothing like this has ever happened to me before. I apologized again and said the drinks are on me and I'm very sorry to make the situation awkward.\nHe said that's absolutely not a problem, he just has to go pee first. I waited. After 15 minutes, I realized he's not coming back. I waited around for a little bit longer and after half an hour I paid and went home.\nUpon getting home, I checked my tinder and saw he deleted his account. Okay, maybe he thought I'm so insane our date made him delete the app.\nStill, it bothered me. I googled him and found nothing. Today, I went to the records office at my uni and asked if a person with his name was studying here. The lady working there told me that's private information she can't share. I then asked if a person with his name has ever obtained a degree from this university. She looked it up and told me that no, no one with his name has ever obtained a degree here.\nHe lied to me. He told me he did his undergraduate degree at my uni. He hasn't. Or, alternatively, he told me a fake name. I'm now sure that he had terrible intentions and did spike my drink. I was more than lucky that someone noticed. I have no idea what he'd do to me had I drank that, and I don't really want to know.\nI'm still a bit creeped out about the situation. I did delete tinder, and I'm very glad I didn't give him my phone number or my address. He did offer to pick me up, and I cleverly said no, yet dumbly told him that the coffee place we met up at is walking distance to my apartment. So he knows the area I live in. As well as my first and last name and where I study. I don't think there's anything I can do about it though - I seriously doubt he even gave me his real name.\nTo the random tinder guy who lied to me and probably tried to drug me, let's not meet.

I know I\u2018m not gonna win any art contest soon, but I wanted to better show the anatomic traits of the being. It\u2018s probably not 100% accurate by a long shot but it\u2019s better than my first one. \nAlso, thanks for all the comments and input on my first post. It felt really liberating to talk about my encounter so openly for the first time and it motivated me to do something I couldn\u2018t for the past six years. I went to the exact spot I saw this creature and looked around and I actually found something.\nThis is the first time I ever went there alone and I have to say I\u2018m kinda proud of myself. I sometimes went there together with my brother but we usually took a right turn before reaching the spot because I was too afraid. The spot is on private property but when I went there today it looked vacant and the electric fence had been removed, so I figured it probably hadn\u2018t been used for a while and took a look around.\nThe first picture I took is an exact representation of where I stood and where the thing stood (blue arrow). The second picture is a close-up of the exact spot the creature stood. It felt extemely strange to be standing so close to it. I noticed something unusual about the vegetation and I hope you can see it in the picture. The vegetation is sort of patchy in this spot and some areas look like they\u2018ve been burned. This is the only spot where it looked like this on the field and I\u2018m honestly clueless as to what I\u2018m looking at. But It\u2019s very strange and I got very uneasy very quickly so I returned home. \nPlease feel free to weigh in on what this could be. Maybe there are some people who are educated on plants and vegetation. \nAnyways, thanks again for all the comments. If you have any ideas what I could do to investigate this further, please let me know. I finally want to get to the bottom of this.

By the time I stood up to look out my bedroom window, the light turned off. I tried triggering the light on but I was too far. I got my phone and snapped a photo with flash hoping that would trigger the sensor. It did and I looked around to see what triggered my light and made all the noise. I didn\u2019t see anything and just assumed it was a possum or a cat. I went to bed and forgot about it up until 2 days ago.\nI live in Southern California, and about a mile down the hill from my house is a  nature reserve. My neighbor and I redid the fence we shared, and I also renovated my backyard. I took a picture of the renovation and I wanted to compare it to how it was before. I scrolled through my pictures and found this photo. I was looking at the fence and when I zoomed in on the picture, it zoomed directly on those glowing eyes!\nAt first I thought,\u201dOh! That must\u2019ve been the critter making all that noise a year ago!\u201d When I zoomed out, I realized how far my window is from where the critter was standing. It\u2019s maybe around 70-80 ft. I don\u2019t know if my depth perception is out of whack, but that\u2019s a pretty big critter! Maybe too big to be a cat or opossum?

Can it maybe have climbed up the tree? \nI showed my neighbor, a Vietnam veteran, and he said,\u201dWhy you gotta show me that for?!

Everything is the same as before, but somehow emotionally I feel different. It's been happening to me for over ten years, a couple of times a year. This feeling only lasts from the time I leave my house to a certain zebra crossing 200-300 meters away, after that it suddenly disappears. I can control it so that when I get this random feeling I can sort of reset it to my normal surroundings. Or even when I don't get the feeling, I can, if I want to, imagine my surroundings with that particular feeling, filter. It's usually on cold and grey days when there's no one on the streets. When I walk along this particular route with this particular feeling, I cannot imagine what one of the streets to the left looks like. When I try to imagine what the street on the left looks like, this feeling, this filter, disappears, but I can bring it back up again if I want to. I know what derealization is and it's certainly not, I've read about jamais vu though, which may be partly true to this, some pages say I don't remember things I see all the time anyway, but that's not true of me. A couple of sites however say that when something we know as familiar seems somehow unreal, different or new, in this case it is more true. Related to this, a memory, when I was young, in the evening my dad and sister were watching E.T. in the living room, and my mom and I went to get cheeseburgers for them, and when we left we went along this route, it was dark and cold. When we got back I looked into the movie and saw E.T. I was really scared and crying. Maybe it's just a memory and a coincidence, but when I think back to that night, when I walk along this route with my mother, I can only think back to the trip with this different feeling, with this filter, I can't imagine this memory in the basic environment. I\u2019ve never talked about this to anyone until yesterday, when my friend asked me if I ever got a paranormal activity feeling. I couldn\u2019t think of any, so I explained this to him. He suddenly got excited because he too, sometimes gets this feeling, but we both thought, that we are the only one. Many things matches, a 200-300 meter route, that it usually happens on grey and cold days and that this is a route we've been taking the most in our life. But he cant controll this feeling, how I can. And he doesnt have a certain memory that I have. We talked about it for hours, and came to the conclusion that this feeling we get is the feeling on the one hand that this ,,thing\u201d already happened to us a couple times, but on the other hand we also have this feeling, that we can\u2019t explain, it\u2019s just something unexplainable. We both know that we cannot explain it to someone who has never felt it before, you only know this if you\u2019ve experienced this before. I hope that some of you gets this feeling and we can talk about it, and share eachothers experience with this feeling.

It isn't really the kind of place that has many issues. Far away from where I grew up. \nI've never been one to shy away from my past. I did thirteen years in federal prison for some crimes that I am still trying to atone for. I know what's waiting for me on the other side, and I know where I'm heading. But I'm still trying to make things right in the world and leave something positive for both of my daughters.\nLately we have been the subject of some random acts of vandalism and threatening messages. One was a letter in our mailbox that said \"murderer\". I committed no such atrocity. Nobody was murdered in any of my crimes. Given that we're just getting past the Halloween season, I assumed it was someone just trying to play a scary prank. Eh, more or less, no harm no foul. \nMy wife found a letter under her windshield wipers that had a similar message saying \"Don't let him fool you\", which included my mugshot from many many years ago. A mugshot that even I've had trouble finding, but managed to do so after some sufficient digging.\nOur garage was also spray painted, a lawn gnome was decapitated, and a series of plastic forks were left in my front yard.\nMy daughters were scared and that's absolutely where the line gets drawn with me. I know people like to say \"but cameras\" and \"call the police\".\nThe ones responsible didn't consider that I work for a security company. Specifically ones that hire ex-cons to save people from people like me. My house has cameras in places you would never think to look, and within a matter of minutes I was able to find a shot of the person responsible. \nIf you're wondering why I didn't do this in the first place, I did. He was just better at hiding his face the first few times. But like all criminals, he slipped up and got too confident. I can relate.\nI knew where to find him. I didn't call the cops. I went over there myself. I knew his parents. Yes, he's a teenager.\nI walked over there and told his parents what he did. They didn't believe me, so I happily showed them the printouts of my security footage that had him clear as day on there. I'll give them credit. They stood up for their son, but also acknowledged when he screwed up and called him over. \nHonestly the look on his face when he saw me inside of his house was all the confirmation anyone needed. He became very nervous and started shaking. I'm not a monster. I assured him that I wasn't there to hurt anyone and that I wanted to have the matter resolved.\nHe had vandalism, trespassing, damage to private property, and mail tampering to answer to. I asked why he did it. Basically the answer I got was that he and his friends were trying to do some sort of true crime series for what I'm assuming is maybe a YouTube channel or something. His explanation wasn't very excessive.\nI gave him a choice. The police could be called, or he could pay for the damages he caused. His father asked if he paid for the damages I would get rid of the footage I have. I told him no. I assured him if the damages were paid for and be stayed away from my family, I wouldn't call the police, but if he didn't, or did it again, I would.\nThey agreed. His father asked me again if I would reconsider, but again I refused.\nThis was his second chance. I'm being very merciful and forgiving those who trespassed against us. I don't know why people feel the need to destroy something that someone is trying to build. In my case, it's stability. We have to seriously start accepting that people are trying to change for the better.\nStan, let's not meet. Unless if course you are coming to clean your mess.

She estimated the wingspan of the tiny aircraft at no more than 12-15 inches, with the tiny pilot in perfect proportion thereto.\nSource: Janet & Colin Bord, Modern Mysteries\nOf Britain also FSR Vol. 16 # 4.", "media": null, "score": 87, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "comment_count": 3, "over_18": false}, "40": {"id": "1gkk9a5", "locked": false, "subreddit": "cryptids", "stickied": false, "category": "Cryptozoology", "author": "LoganXp123", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1731121007.3534935, "created_utc": 1730848413.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/ur9e212z06zd1.jpeg", "title": "Went to Point Pleasant and Flatwoods for my birthday \ud83e\udd73 ( I would put more pictures but i can\u2019t for some reason )", "permalink": "/r/cryptids/comments/1gkk9a5/went_to_point_pleasant_and_flatwoods_for_my/", "selftext": "", "media": null, "score": 498, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comment_count": 27, "over_18": false}, "41": {"id": "1gkez5d", "locked": false, "subreddit": "thetruthishere", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "NoSecretary508", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1731121007.6087132, "created_utc": 1730834754.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1gkez5d/scratching_in_the_closet/", "title": "Scratching in the closet.", "permalink": "/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1gkez5d/scratching_in_the_closet/", "selftext": "when i was 12 i lived in this one house for about a year, and for around a month every night i would hear this sort of scratching sound in my closet but id always assume it was my sister because her room was on the other side of my closet.

We just got the full context today.\nWe live in a sub-unit of a large house. Our landlord and one other person live in the other units of the house. We noticed that our landlord had brought a few different dates over to the house. We didn't mind, and we weren't surprised when a girl was walking around the property.\nLast month, we went to sleep at about midnight and woke up 30 minutes later to knocks at the door. I told my bf not to open it, but he said it was the girl we saw earlier. I still felt very uneasy about the situation. So I put my clothes on, grabbed my keys, and picked up our dog in case I had to run out the back door. I then go stand in the hallway next to the front door so I can hear the conversation, but she can't see me.\nShe sounds very drunk, and she tells my bf that she is my landlord's fianc\u00e9. I am somewhat confused by this because of our landlord's other dates. However, she starts talking about how we are good tenants and mentions personal details about us, so we assume she is actually his fianc\u00e9. She asked my boyfriend for a lighter for her cigarette. We expect this to be the end of the interaction, but she then tells my bf that our landlord is at a hotel cheating on her right now. My bf responds with, \"Oh wow.\" She then started flirting with my bf. She invited him to come swim in our landlord's pool with her and he declined. I'm starting to get less scared and more annoyed at her. She is rambling about a bunch of different topics and basically holding my bf hostage. Finally, she gets to our neighbors. She starts going on a racist rant about them, using slurs I have literally never heard in real life because they are that bad. At this point, I'm pretty sick of this woman, so I step into the door frame and tell her that we have to wake up early. She was clearly shocked by me showing up. This is when her face changes. She glares at me. Suddenly, we aren't good tenants anymore. She calls us \"white trash\" for not taking our garbage bins out in time for trash day. She screams that she is going to get us evicted if we don't get on her good side. At this point, we close the door in her face.\nWe had a really long discussion about whether or not we should complain to our landlord about her. We assumed that he actually was dating this girl and that she just happened to be crazy. She probably caught him cheating and was trying to sleep with my bf for revenge, but realized that wasn't going to happen. Eventually, we decided to text him. He apologized for the situation but was very vague. He does mention that she is NOT his fianc\u00e9 and that he will remove her. We assume this is the end of it. For the last month, she's been blasting music, banging on the walls, taking things out of the shed, and coming into our section of the backyard in the middle of the night. I was absolutely terrified the first week and couldn't sleep at all. I would stay up all night listening to sounds and staring at our back window to see if she was in our yard. Eventually, I got used to it.\nOur landlord had basically vanished. We haven't seen him for the entire month... until today. Today my bf is walking our dog when he sees our landlord back on his porch. Our landlord finally tells us the full story. He went on a few dates with this woman, and she seemed totally normal. Eventually, they go back to his section of the house, and when he wakes up, she is behaving much differently. He asks her to head out while he goes to work. He comes back, and she's still there. It turns out that this is what she does. She goes home with men and invades their home until they get her lawfully evicted. My landlord went to a different property for a month while he worked on his case to get her evicted. We found out that she got served an eviction warning the same day that she came to our house. That's why she was flirting with my bf in an attempt to squat in our home. That's why she was so angry when she found out I lived there too. My landlord actually negotiated a way to get her out of the house a few days early. He bought her a one-way flight to another state. So, if you live in the Midwest, watch out. She's coming north. I'm very thankful that it's over, though.

Then it suddenly turned so I ended up turning onto a private unmarked road which is probably used for farm equipment to tend to the adjacent field crop. \nAt that point, I was running out of road to go any further. So, I got out of vehicle to take a better view of it. Then, suddenly, the object started moving towards me. It startled me so I ran like hell for a little bit. It was making a very strange low swirling noise...so, please try and turn up your speaker volume to hear it better.\nOnce I moved a distance back, I zoomed out the camera a bit more and noticed the object was hovering directly over my vehicle. Then it started to lower itself as it slowly rotated directly over my roof! At that point, it appeared to be shining a very bright green beam over it. Then suddenly, it shot straight up into the sky and the swirling sound disappeared at the exact time it vanished. This was a very eerie experience and even my hair was standing on end through the entire time and felt as if there was highly dense static electricity in the air!\nWhat the heck do you think this is people??

Methamphetamine was mentioned at one point but I kind of blanked on exact conversation bc all I\u2019m thinking is his vibe is weird, he won\u2019t stop talking and from that first conversation about Margot Robbie being hot I was gonna be happy for cab ride to be over.\nHe went to pull up into a car space that was obviously way too small for this big van that he\u2019s driving and I actually had to say look I don\u2019t want to obstruct traffic and he kind of angrily muttered something about the trees being in the way and aggressively pulled out and into a bigger space further up. \nAfter I\u2019ve paid he\u2019s unbuckled his seatbelt and got out and said do you mind if I caffeinate with you? I was legit so shocked at his brazenness - I\u2019m with my son and have places to be - that I kind of just mumbled an okay. \nHe proceeds to follow me into the coffee store. He starts to say something about \u201ca nude model on the beach\u201d and luckily the attendant interjects asking if I\u2019d like to place my order so I get out of hearing whatever was going to follow on from that statement.\nI order my coffee and head straight down to the back of the store where they have an enclosed play area for my toddler while I wait for coffee.\nHe orders and follows me down and excuses himself to \u201cmake some room\u201d. Gross.\nOne of the attendants comes down with his coffee and asks if she should put this here. I look at her exasperated and I said \u201cwell I don\u2019t know, he\u2019s not with me\u201d \nAnd she said I thought you two were together? I said \u201cNooooooo he is my cab driver and I don\u2019t know him. This is weird, Isn\u2019t it?\u201d \nShe looked really confused, confronted and then concerned and was amazing and said I\u2019ll if you need any help let one of know and we will get the owner \nSo anyway he comes out while at least 10 minutes later but very shortly after the coffees arrived and I\u2019m packing my son up to leave to walk to preschool/daycare (it\u2019s literally a 2 minute walk away) and I mention I\u2019m heading off\nHe asks if he can give me a ride up to the preschool? No, no it\u2019s fine, it\u2019s a short walk. He tries to insist. I insist: No, thank you, it\u2019s a nice walk. Then he asks what time am I coming back? I am reluctant to give any details by now so I just say I\u2019m not sure and he continues to probe as to wether it\u2019ll be around an hour and if so he call his office and see if he could wait for me. In the politest of ways I say hell to the no and I\u2019ll be a few hours at least - which wasn\u2019t really a lie - I was gonna be three exactly but didn\u2019t want him knowing.\nI ended up feeling so out of sorts by the behaviour that I filed a complaint with the taxi company. My husband went looking for his taxi, being a small town, he was ropable but luckily didn\u2019t find him. I appreciated his valour though. \nI now feel confused, about wether my gut feeling on this guy was correct and kind of scared because he knows where we live, which is on a property with no neighbours close by and no husband home during the day. \nAm I overreacting?", "media": null, "score": 86, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comment_count": 12, "over_18": true}, "56": {"id": "1gjgw2k", "locked": false, "subreddit": "ghosts", "stickied": false, "category": "Paranormal", "author": "Majestic-Cloud-2914", "link_flair_text": null, "time": 1731121019.0694668, "created_utc": 1730733977.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/1gjgw2k/have_you_ever_had_a_ghost_encountersighting_if_so/", "title": "Have you ever had a ghost encounter/sighting if so what happened?

There are thousands of well-documented cases, and some researchers believe they may number in the millions. These cases of direct contact with ETs involve extensive interactions and contain more information about the extraterrestrials than any other kind of encounter. Here are six shocking cases from across the world: Australia, Canada, France and three from the United States. The UFO phenomenon is so much more than just simple sightings of unexplained lights in the sky. It\u2019s about meeting people from other worlds.\n\u201cI WAS IN A UFO.\u201d In 1972, \u201cSteve\u201d (age 24) was staying in a cabin in the wilderness of Cariboo, British Columbia, Canada. One summer day, he stepped outside and was amazed to see two silver discs fly at treetop level a few hundred feet away. He somehow knew they were going to land and that he had to go meet them. He asked his girlfriend to join him, but she strangely refused. Steve went alone and came upon the two craft, landed on the ground. One had an open door and a ramp leading to the ground. Curious, Steve approached and entered. Inside he saw two short humanoids with gray wrinkled skin, wearing white doctors\u2019 smocks. Afraid, he was about to run when one spoke telepathically in perfect English, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, come on in.\u201d So began an extensive onboard experience that Steve would keep secret for most of his life.\nTAKEN IN TARBORO. James Howard (age 15) and his friend Brian Hollis (age 14) had been seeing odd lights near their homes in Tarboro, NC for a few weeks. Then, on the night of November 12, 1976, they saw a metallic, disc-shaped craft with colored lights land in the forest nearby. Going to investigate, they became frightened when a glowing, white-suited humanoid figure appeared. When they arrived home, more than an hour had passed. James began having nightmares of being onboard. Later, under hypnosis, he recalled that both he and Brian were floated up into the craft, separated and given medical exams.\nYURANI. It was a warm night in July 1981 as \u201cRobert\u201d (age 16) played frisbee with his dog outside his home in Seattle, Washington. Suddenly, clouds rolled in and Robert saw colored lights overhead. Robert now found himself unable to move as a warm beam of light pulled him up and into the craft. He recalled seeing a being with cat-like eyes, then woke up the next morning in bed. Years later, he recalled a long onboard experience where he was met by a hybrid human-gray who introduced herself as Yurani. She told him that she was more than 200 years old, and began to impart a lot of information about why the ETs were visiting Earth. At one point, Robert was taken to their home planet.\nSEVEN HOURS ONBOARD AN ALIEN SPACECRAFT. Eduardo Pons Prades was a famous political author in Spain when, on the night of August 31, 1981, his life changed forever. He was driving through the Pyrenees in France when he became weirdly lost and his car mysteriously stalled. Walking down a narrow country road, he came upon a large craft landed in a field. A door opened and a commanding voice spoke to him telepathically: \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. Please approach\u2026Come up to our ship. We wish to speak with you.\u201d Unable to resist, Eduardo went onboard and was greeted by a group of beautiful human-looking people in white jumpsuits. They told him that they had contacted him because of his expertise in human violence, and that he needed to give the world a message.\n\u201cWE ARE YOUR FRIENDS.\u201d One night in March 1982, an anonymous woman driving near Springfield, Missouri noticed a strange light at treetop level ahead of her car. At that moment, she seemed to lose control of the steering wheel and felt like her car was floating. The next thing she knew, she was parked next to a huge craft landed in field. She was drawn onboard and was greeted by six tall, strong, human-looking figures with blue eyes and blonde hair. They proceeded to examine her and said that they were researching human reproduction. They explained that they were her friends and would see her again.\n\u201cWHAT DO YOU WANT US FOR?\u201d One night in 1986, three young men were camping in the wilderness outside of Kalgoorlie, Western Australia when they heard a strange noise overhead. Looking up, a brilliant light approached and descended, revealing itself to be a silver disc-shaped craft. Two little beings appeared underneath and approached the men, who found themselves now unable to move. All three men were floated up into the craft and subjected to a strange examination involving lights. The ETs were friendly and smiling as the witnesses were given a tour of the craft and soon saw something which left them speechless with wonder.\nSix shocking onboard UFO encounters, each providing profound insights into the nature and origins of extraterrestrials, each providing answers about the ET agenda on our planet.
